0,"Michael Bublé has officially retired from music following his son Noah's cancer battle.  The singer, 43, explained that the heartache he endured following son's cancer diagnosis at just three years old has changed his 'perception of life' and he is now done with fame.  Noah, now five, is currently in remission following his battle with liver cancer, but the ordeal has been life-changing for Bublé, who has since questioned his career in showbusiness.  Michael Bublé reveals he has decided to quit the music industry following his son's battle with cancer  Michael is married to Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, 31, and they share three children together; their eldest son Noah, son Elias, two, and daughter Vida, whom they welcomed two months ago.  Both he and Luisana put their careers on hold to be there for their son - they jetted to the US so Noah could undergo treatment for hepatoblastoma.  The singer recalled how he used to make the 'best of the situation' during his hospital visits with Noah and tried to make it fun for his little boy.  Noah (pictured) now five, is currently in remission but Bublé says the ordeal has been life changing  With a new album, titled Love, on the way, he explained that this is his time to step away from music, wanting to leave at the 'very top' after making the 'perfect record'.  Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his 'last interview' with Daily Mail's Weekend magazine...  'My whole being’s changed since my son got cancer': Michael Bublé says he was embarrassed to realise just how egotistical he’d become as he nursed his boy Noah back to health - but now he's got his mojo back  By Chrissy Iley for Weekend Magazine  Michael Bublé knows better than most that fate does not stand aside and wave the famous through.  The Canadian singer has won four Grammys and sold 75 million records, earning him some £35 million a year.  Bublé opened up about the turmoil he and his family went through after his son Noah (pictured together) was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago  He’s been married to stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato for seven years, and the couple live a life of luxury with their three children, sons Noah, five, and Elias, two, and daughter Vida Amber Betty, who’s just 11 weeks old.  Yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago, and the devastated couple immediately announced they were putting their careers on hold to care for their son.  Noah has now been declared cancer-free and today Michael is looking suave and slim when we meet in his London hotel suite. He has a new album out, Love – but it’s one that he admits now might never have been made.  He’s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it’s clear he’s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.  ‘You just want to die,’ he says. ‘I don’t even know how I was breathing.  'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn’t strong. My wife was... I’m sorry, I can’t make it to the end of the sentence... let’s just say we find out who we are with these things.  Michael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear  'Going through this with Noah, I didn’t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?  'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.’  He says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni’s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni’s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.  ‘I don’t know if that was a choice, but that’s who I became,’ he says. ‘For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.  The singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did  'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I’d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.  ‘It’s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it’s not my story to tell, it’s his.  'But my whole being’s changed. My perception of life. I don’t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I’ve never lost control of my emotions in public.’  Michael likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  As a teenager he’d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he’d emulate them. ‘In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,’ he says.  ‘I actually thought I’d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.  'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.  'Everyone recognises me and says, “How’s your son?” When you think you’re close to getting over it you’re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.  Michael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis  'The media helped me, they weren’t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, “We love you and we’re praying for you.”’  I was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. ‘I had no interest in my career and I’m grateful I could afford to take time out,’ he says.  ‘I spent a good deal of time with people who weren’t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business.  'I’d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I’d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.  'I’d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I’d been having fun. I’d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.’  He grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. ‘I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.  I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have  'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.  'And I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have.  ‘I realised that for many years I couldn’t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn’t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I’d be saying things like, “It’s hard to get here, but my God it’s harder to stay here.”  'But then I woke up and thought, “After ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.”’  It seems that his son’s illness ignited this realisation that he’d become fixated on his own success. ‘I don’t have the stomach for it any more,’ he says.  ‘The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.  'I’d forgotten that it’s about souls connecting, because I’d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, “If you hadn’t done this or that, or you’d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.”  'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.  'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, “It’s my fault. I’m absolutely rubbish.”  'It affected me and I started to think, “It’s all going to go. I’m going to lose everything.”  ‘I was insecure. I’d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I’d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.  'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I’m not a mere photocopy. I’ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.  'It needed clarifying. Now I’m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that’s when it comes back to you. Like love.’  Michael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.  Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart  He blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn’t careful) and started going to the gym.  He was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.  They met again at a party and he told her, ‘You’re my wife, you just don’t know it yet. I’m going to come back and marry you.’  A year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, ‘I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father’s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.’  When he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael’s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?  ‘The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn’t as straightforward as, “My son’s recovered, I should make an album,”’ he explains. ‘I’d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.  After that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018  'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, “Come over to the house, let’s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.”  They came over, we partied and we said, “Let’s play some music.” I thought, “Wow! This is fun.”’  He takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. ‘It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago.’  He’s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents – we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.  It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago  He’s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. ‘We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he’s in my house “all the day”, as my little boy would say.’  He pauses. ‘There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,’ he says.  ‘One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.  'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending – not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up – there’s never a better time for music.’  Then suddenly he stops. ‘This is my last interview,’ he says quite solemnly. ‘I’m retiring from the business. I’ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.’  Somehow, though, I don’t think he really means it.  Michael’s album Love will be released on 16 November.

The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:"

Either way, it’s double standards.”  “Outlaw King” director David McKenzie griped to Metro about the hype around Pine’s penis.  “It’s a man getting clean in a cold [lake] — you don’t do that with your clothes on,” McKenzie said. “And it’s microseconds. It’s ridiculous all the fuss about it.”  Pine previously said his nearly-nude scene in “Wonder Woman” inspired him to work out.  “I was excited,” he said of playing a naked Steve Trevor in the hit DC film. “I was like, ‘All right, man. Now the gauntlet is thrown. I’ve got something to prep for.’ It’s a 40-foot screen. If people are laughing at you doing push-ups on the set on the day, I don’t really care, because I’m going to be in Slovakia. I’ve got to prep for the Slovakians.”  He also said he didn’t mind being “objectified” by audiences of the Gal Gadot star vehicle.  “It was fun to be objectified for a day,” Pine told “Entertainment Tonight” in May 2017. “I was thinking this happens to women so, so much, it’s about time. While that was fun, I think it’s the most compassionate I’ve felt toward women on what they may feel being sidelined or made to feel less important.”"

Amongst the many celebrities that we lost in 2016 was Carrie Fisher, whose portrayal of a brave rebel princess was equally as important as her interest in advocating for mental health awareness as well as women's rights. Now, Star Wars is honoring the legendary actress with a series of moving tributes created for the Star Wars Celebration event held in Orlando, Florida, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of A New Hope.  Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter, made a surprise appearance at the gala. Following George Lucas' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.  ""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""  Billie concluded her speech by reciting Leia's legendary plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The official Star Wars twitter account also posted this moving video homage to Carrie:  It was recently revealed that the late actress would, in fact, make a a posthumous appearance in Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Jedi, after her family gave Lucasfilm permission to use footage shot before her death. Episode IX will debut in theaters on May 23rd, 2019."

Early on Wednesday — five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat — the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.  “OMG!!! i’m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, “in the spring sometime.”  Brielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: “OMG!!! i can’t wait to meet the little nugget. it’s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.”  A few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. “Brielle’s lying!” she said. “She’s lying!”  But it’s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.  “I would love to have another little boy,” she told Us. “I am just obsessed with my boys.” The Don’t Be Tardy star added: “I’m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we’re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.”  And during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. “I have baby fever so bad,” she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: “Never say never.”  Meanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “The private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,” she wrote. “But I accidentally sent it to everyone.”  Zolciak also wants the world to know she didn’t confirm Khloé’ Kardashian’s pregnancy.  “The conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,” Zolciak said. “Everyone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.”"

Who could forget Prince William's goddaughter, Grace Van Cutsem, stealing the limelight during his first kiss with the Duchess of Cambridge after their wedding?  The latest kid to totally upstage a monarch is 11-year-old Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway.

(Image: Getty)  But to the left of the monarchs in clips of the celebrations, a cheeky young prince was doing his best to keep fellow youngsters entertained - and totally stole the show.  Prince Sverre, who is third in line to the Norwegian throne - just like Britain's Prince George - could be seen mumbling and pulling faces, drawing eye rolls from his cousins and sister.  The cheeky chap, son of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, then decided to kick it up a notch and performed the popular 'dab' move (you can watch the video to see exactly how this one works) prompting giggles from the children around him.  It was such a 'blink and you'll miss it' moment, he almost got away with it, but unfortunately for him, cameras captured everything.  His antics prompted a sharp nudge from fed-up cousin Leah Isadora Behn, aged 12, who looks as though she was keeping him in check.

1,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.  “A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”  The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.  A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”  According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.  The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.  Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained."
1,"Fans believe Taylor Swift's single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" targets Kanye West. Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:  Kanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift's album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother's death.  In response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.  The plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.  Around 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.    Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released — it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.  Though Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.  The subreddit that started it all. Reddit  ""Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim's Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye's font and cover art style for her new album 'Reputation.' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye's mother, Donda West's death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor's songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.""  Not content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit . Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish.  The post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there's an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, ""Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day"" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just ""Hey Mama"" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around."

She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports."
1,"I don't know who is more excited about Khloé's new baby: The Kardashian family or me. (Probably the family, but it might actually be a close call.) By now you've most definitely heard that on April 12, TMZ reported Khloé Kardashian gave birth to her daughter and wow, I feel so emotional just writing that. Don't judge... Kardashian babies just bring it out in me, OK? But now that Kardashian's baby has arrived, the world is so, so happy about it, and of course, the Kardashians' reactions to Khloé Kardashian's baby make me want to cry tears of pure joy. There is too much love, you guys.  UPDATE 2: Kim Kardashian also opened up about Khloé giving birth. She tweeted on April 13, ""@khloekardashian I’m so happy for you! Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy! I can’t wait for our baby girls to grow up as best friends the way we are! I’m so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL."" She also tweeted, ""You guys she’s so gorgeous!!!!!""  UPDATE 1: Kylie Jenner has also sent her congratulations to her big sister on the birth of her baby girl. Jenner posted a photo to Snapchat using a filter that read, ""Kongrats, Khloé! It's a girl!""  EARLIER: Before we dive into the Kardashian love-fest, let's go back to where it all began: That fateful day of Dec. 20, 2017, when Khloé Kardashian gave the world a Christmas miracle in the form of an Instagram post confirming her pregnancy.  She wrote,  My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love!  I will never *not* cry at this announcement, TBH.  As if she didn't do enough simply by sharing her pregnancy, she went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and discussed potential name ideas, though at the time, she had no clue whether she was having a boy or a girl. ""I think if it's a boy I'll go with Tristan Junior,"" she said, adding, ""For a girl I don't even know where to begin. I think I'll go with a K or a T name though.""  The video, which you can check out below, had me screaming:  God bless Khloé Kardashian.  We of course know Kardashian revealed her baby's sex on the season finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, telling her family and fans that she was expecting a little girl:  And then wrote the sweetest message on Twitter, feeling very fortunate to be having a little lady. She wrote,  I am now so excited my daughter will have forever best friends with Chicago and Stormi!! God is great!!! Thank you Lord for our princess  Fans loved seeing Kardashian's reaction about the reveal. Too sweet for words.  When reports first came out that Kardashian gave birth, the entire world collectively screamed and cried tears of joy. Many took to Twitter to express how excited they were.  But the most excited were obviously her siblings and her mom, Kris Jenner. Jenner posted a video of Kendall Jenner repeating the word ""baby,"" that was originally posted by W Magazine. The original caption read, ""When three of your sisters give birth in under a year. Congratulations to @KhloeKardashian on welcoming another girl to the KarJenner clan."" Jenner reposted it, writing, ""BLESSED!!!""  Kourtney Kardashian also posted an Instagram to her page that showed North West, Penelope Disick, and Tracy Romulus' daughter. The caption read, ""GIRL POWER."" This caption could be a tiny clue that Kourtney was celebrating the birth of Khloé's daughter and the sisterhood that is their family.  I am seriously swooning right now.  I love how all the Kardashians are so supportive of one another and so excited for all of the new arrivals in their family as of late (looking at you, Chicago West and Stormi Webster).  A big congratulations to Kardashian and the whole crew!"
1,"The British royal family is a very private bunch, so consequently speculation about their personal lives runs rampant. And now that Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews is approaching, gossip magazines (in particular, The Sun) are reporting that she has the royal equivalent of *beef* with Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle.  The specifics? Apparently, Markle won't be invited to Pippa's wedding thanks to a ""no ring, no bring"" policy—with a source noting, ""It's clear Pippa doesn't want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day.""  Pippa Middleton and James Matthews attend Wimbledon in 2016. Getty Images  Interestingly, Pippa's future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews is also reportedly not allowed to bring his girlfriend, reality television star Vogue Williams. ""Pippa's view is that Vogue's relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,"" the source says. ""But some people in the circle are pretty shocked because this is her future brother-in-law who's going to end up attending on his own. It's certainly raised eyebrows.""  Vogue Williams Getty Images  The Daily Mail also reported on Pippa's ""no ring, no bring"" policy back in March, saying Meghan's appearance at the wedding of Harry's best friend raised concerns. ""She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan's presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.""  👀 to be sure, but let's take this news with a grain of Salt Bae.

1,"Getty  After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.  A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun."
1,"The ongoing rumors about Brad Pitt and his ex-wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, continue to swirl regarding a supposed reconciliation between the former couple. The claims have only intensified ever since Jennifer Aniston and her husband of two years, actor Justin Theroux, called it quits recently.  While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to work their way through a very challenging time, involving their own divorce and custody battle over their six children, the pair has been constantly linked to various rumored new loves. Despite Pitt having been falsely linked to a list of beauties, Jennifer Aniston has remained the most frequent female celeb to be rumored as spending time with the heartthrob.  Now the focus is on how Angelina Jolie is reacting to the rumored reconciliation between Pitt and his former wife, Aniston. Reports swirl that Angelina and Jen are gearing up for a showdown over the Allied star and that Pitt is ""freaking out"" over the drama that his and Aniston's supposed closeness has resulted in.  New Idea shares alleged details relayed by a source on the lengthy love triangle between the three. The insider relays that Jen and Angelina have already spoken about the big night that will see the trio in the same room, along with anyone who's anyone in Hollywood and film. The three will all attend the Oscars and the women are said to have discussed boundaries for the occasion that could result in a ""showdown"" between Jen and Angelina.  ""Word is Jen and Angie had a major discussion about the Oscars. It's the biggest night of the year, and they know they'll both be party-hopping,"" the insider states. ""However, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, 'neither are willing to budge an inch,' resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other – something neither are very happy about,"" the publication continues.  The star ex-husband to both these talented beauties is reportedly quite stressed out about the potential words that will be exchanged at one of the entertainment industry's most formal and important events.  ""I heard he's frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs – no good could possibly come from it,"" the insider claims.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently announced their separation in a joint statement, within which the pair stated that they will carry on as friends and to not believe any stories that are making the rounds, reminding that what comes from them is the only truth.  This has not stopped fabrications from swirling. The rumors even now go so far as to say that Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux have met up to find comfort and plot against Jen and Brad over their said reconciliation. This, however, has been debunked and is not to be believed, as Gossip Cop has informed readers.  This latest claim is yet to be verified, and if there is tension between the trio, the stars will likely keep their personal matters out of the prestigious event on Sunday."
