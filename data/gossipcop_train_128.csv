0,"Michael Bublé has officially retired from music following his son Noah's cancer battle.  The singer, 43, explained that the heartache he endured following son's cancer diagnosis at just three years old has changed his 'perception of life' and he is now done with fame.  Noah, now five, is currently in remission following his battle with liver cancer, but the ordeal has been life-changing for Bublé, who has since questioned his career in showbusiness.  Michael Bublé reveals he has decided to quit the music industry following his son's battle with cancer  Michael is married to Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, 31, and they share three children together; their eldest son Noah, son Elias, two, and daughter Vida, whom they welcomed two months ago.  Both he and Luisana put their careers on hold to be there for their son - they jetted to the US so Noah could undergo treatment for hepatoblastoma.  The singer recalled how he used to make the 'best of the situation' during his hospital visits with Noah and tried to make it fun for his little boy.  Noah (pictured) now five, is currently in remission but Bublé says the ordeal has been life changing  With a new album, titled Love, on the way, he explained that this is his time to step away from music, wanting to leave at the 'very top' after making the 'perfect record'.  Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his 'last interview' with Daily Mail's Weekend magazine...  'My whole being’s changed since my son got cancer': Michael Bublé says he was embarrassed to realise just how egotistical he’d become as he nursed his boy Noah back to health - but now he's got his mojo back  By Chrissy Iley for Weekend Magazine  Michael Bublé knows better than most that fate does not stand aside and wave the famous through.  The Canadian singer has won four Grammys and sold 75 million records, earning him some £35 million a year.  Bublé opened up about the turmoil he and his family went through after his son Noah (pictured together) was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago  He’s been married to stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato for seven years, and the couple live a life of luxury with their three children, sons Noah, five, and Elias, two, and daughter Vida Amber Betty, who’s just 11 weeks old.  Yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago, and the devastated couple immediately announced they were putting their careers on hold to care for their son.  Noah has now been declared cancer-free and today Michael is looking suave and slim when we meet in his London hotel suite. He has a new album out, Love – but it’s one that he admits now might never have been made.  He’s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it’s clear he’s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.  ‘You just want to die,’ he says. ‘I don’t even know how I was breathing.  'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn’t strong. My wife was... I’m sorry, I can’t make it to the end of the sentence... let’s just say we find out who we are with these things.  Michael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear  'Going through this with Noah, I didn’t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?  'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.’  He says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni’s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni’s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.  ‘I don’t know if that was a choice, but that’s who I became,’ he says. ‘For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.  The singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did  'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I’d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.  ‘It’s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it’s not my story to tell, it’s his.  'But my whole being’s changed. My perception of life. I don’t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I’ve never lost control of my emotions in public.’  Michael likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  As a teenager he’d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he’d emulate them. ‘In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,’ he says.  ‘I actually thought I’d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.  'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.  'Everyone recognises me and says, “How’s your son?” When you think you’re close to getting over it you’re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.  Michael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis  'The media helped me, they weren’t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, “We love you and we’re praying for you.”’  I was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. ‘I had no interest in my career and I’m grateful I could afford to take time out,’ he says.  ‘I spent a good deal of time with people who weren’t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business.  'I’d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I’d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.  'I’d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I’d been having fun. I’d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.’  He grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. ‘I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.  I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have  'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.  'And I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have.  ‘I realised that for many years I couldn’t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn’t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I’d be saying things like, “It’s hard to get here, but my God it’s harder to stay here.”  'But then I woke up and thought, “After ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.”’  It seems that his son’s illness ignited this realisation that he’d become fixated on his own success. ‘I don’t have the stomach for it any more,’ he says.  ‘The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.  'I’d forgotten that it’s about souls connecting, because I’d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, “If you hadn’t done this or that, or you’d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.”  'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.  'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, “It’s my fault. I’m absolutely rubbish.”  'It affected me and I started to think, “It’s all going to go. I’m going to lose everything.”  ‘I was insecure. I’d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I’d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.  'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I’m not a mere photocopy. I’ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.  'It needed clarifying. Now I’m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that’s when it comes back to you. Like love.’  Michael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.  Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart  He blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn’t careful) and started going to the gym.  He was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.  They met again at a party and he told her, ‘You’re my wife, you just don’t know it yet. I’m going to come back and marry you.’  A year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, ‘I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father’s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.’  When he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael’s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?  ‘The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn’t as straightforward as, “My son’s recovered, I should make an album,”’ he explains. ‘I’d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.  After that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018  'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, “Come over to the house, let’s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.”  They came over, we partied and we said, “Let’s play some music.” I thought, “Wow! This is fun.”’  He takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. ‘It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago.’  He’s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents – we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.  It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago  He’s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. ‘We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he’s in my house “all the day”, as my little boy would say.’  He pauses. ‘There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,’ he says.  ‘One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.  'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending – not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up – there’s never a better time for music.’  Then suddenly he stops. ‘This is my last interview,’ he says quite solemnly. ‘I’m retiring from the business. I’ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.’  Somehow, though, I don’t think he really means it.  Michael’s album Love will be released on 16 November.

The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:"
0,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Chris Pine doesn’t see the big deal about being nude onscreen in “Outlaw King” and nearly naked in “Wonder Woman.”  “I bear the full monty [in ‘Outlaw King’] and it got a lot of attention,” Pine, 38, said on “The Graham Norton Show” on Friday. “I thought the witty reviews were brilliant, but what did strike me most is that Florence Pugh bares everything too and no one commented.”  “I am not sure what that means,” he admitted. “Either people think they can’t comment or everyone expects women to get naked. Either way, it’s double standards.”  “Outlaw King” director David McKenzie griped to Metro about the hype around Pine’s penis.  “It’s a man getting clean in a cold [lake] — you don’t do that with your clothes on,” McKenzie said. “And it’s microseconds. It’s ridiculous all the fuss about it.”  Pine previously said his nearly-nude scene in “Wonder Woman” inspired him to work out.  “I was excited,” he said of playing a naked Steve Trevor in the hit DC film. “I was like, ‘All right, man. Now the gauntlet is thrown. I’ve got something to prep for.’ It’s a 40-foot screen. If people are laughing at you doing push-ups on the set on the day, I don’t really care, because I’m going to be in Slovakia. I’ve got to prep for the Slovakians.”  He also said he didn’t mind being “objectified” by audiences of the Gal Gadot star vehicle.  “It was fun to be objectified for a day,” Pine told “Entertainment Tonight” in May 2017. “I was thinking this happens to women so, so much, it’s about time. While that was fun, I think it’s the most compassionate I’ve felt toward women on what they may feel being sidelined or made to feel less important.”"

0,"""She loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia,"" the actress recalled.  Amongst the many celebrities that we lost in 2016 was Carrie Fisher, whose portrayal of a brave rebel princess was equally as important as her interest in advocating for mental health awareness as well as women's rights. Now, Star Wars is honoring the legendary actress with a series of moving tributes created for the Star Wars Celebration event held in Orlando, Florida, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of A New Hope.  Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter, made a surprise appearance at the gala. Following George Lucas' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.  ""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""  Billie concluded her speech by reciting Leia's legendary plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The official Star Wars twitter account also posted this moving video homage to Carrie:  It was recently revealed that the late actress would, in fact, make a a posthumous appearance in Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Jedi, after her family gave Lucasfilm permission to use footage shot before her death. Episode IX will debut in theaters on May 23rd, 2019."

0,"Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak and her daughter Brielle Biermann are causing quite the stir on social media this week.  Early on Wednesday — five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat — the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.  “OMG!!! i’m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, “in the spring sometime.”  Brielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: “OMG!!! i can’t wait to meet the little nugget. it’s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.”  A few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. “Brielle’s lying!” she said. “She’s lying!”  But it’s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.  “I would love to have another little boy,” she told Us. “I am just obsessed with my boys.” The Don’t Be Tardy star added: “I’m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we’re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.”  And during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. “I have baby fever so bad,” she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: “Never say never.”  Meanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “The private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,” she wrote. “But I accidentally sent it to everyone.”  Zolciak also wants the world to know she didn’t confirm Khloé’ Kardashian’s pregnancy.  “The conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,” Zolciak said. “Everyone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.”"

After meeting at university, the pair were close pals for more than a year and lived in a shared house together before romance finally blossomed.  When asked about the moment they first laid eyes on each other, William said he would have to ""wrack his brains"" to remember it.  But Kate on the other hand remembers the moment perfectly, and it's fair to say it understandably probably wasn't her most cool and collected moment.  (Image: PA)  During the couple's engagement interview back in 2010 she recalled the moment she first saw her future husband.  She said: ""I actually went bright red when I met you and scuttled off feeling very shy about meeting you.  ""William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there from Fresher's Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other.  ""But we did become very close friends from quite early on.""  How sweet!  (Image: Getty Images Europe) (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  There were many rumours flying around at the time that Kate had a poster of the Prince on her wall - but she quickly corrected them.  She said: ""He wishes. I had the Levi guy on my wall, not a picture of William.""  Sorry Wills.  In the interview the duke and duchess also spoke about their brief split , and explained why it was so important to their relationship.  William said: ""We did split up for a bit.  ""We were both very young, it was at university and we were both finding ourselves and being different characters and stuff.  ""It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""It was just a bit of space. It worked out for the better.""  Kate admitted she wasn't happy about the break-up at the time, but in hindsight believes it was a good idea.  She said: ""At the time I wasn't very happy about it but actually it made me a stronger person.""  (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  ""You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised.  ""I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger.  ""I really valued that time, for me as well, although i didn't think it at the time."""
0,"The 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea officially kicked off on Friday, Feb. 9 with a highly-anticipated opening ceremony.  The Olympics opening ceremony, which had a theme of peace, featured K-pop (several countries marched out to BTS, and Team USA marched out to “Gangnam Style“), heated patriotic uniforms and some very cold temperatures.  Days before the event, organizers were working to stop a norovirus outbreak from spreading, ensure spectators and performers were equipped to endure freezing temperatures, and avoid exacerbating tensions among world leaders in attendance, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Here are the key details to know about the Olympics opening ceremony:  What time did the 2018 Olympics opening ceremony start?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in PyeongChang on Feb. 9, beginning at 8 p.m. local time (6 a.m. EST).  The official Winter Olympic Games schedule began Thursday, with curling and ski jumping events starting on Feb. 8.  How can I watch the Olympics opening ceremony?  Early-bird Olympic enthusiasts in the United States were able to watch the opening ceremony live beginning at 6 a.m. EST on NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app, which is available on streaming devices, including Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV. Later on Friday at 8 p.m. EST, NBC will air a “fully-produced” television broadcast of the opening ceremony, featuring interviews and commentary by hosts Katie Couric and Mike Tirico.  Where was the opening ceremony held?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in the new PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, which seats 35,000 people. The venue will be used just four times — for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Olympics and Paralympics — before being torn down. Construction of the stadium was part of the roughly $13 billion that South Korea is spending on the Olympics, the Associated Press reported.  But amid severe winter weather warnings, organizers feared that the Olympic stadium, which has no roof, might make the opening ceremony too cold for spectators to endure. Temperatures in PyeongChang this month have been falling to -4 degrees Fahrenheit at night, Reuters reported.  The forecast prompted organizers to work on measures to prevent cases of hypothermia and prepare for no-shows. Spectators were given hot packs, seat warmers, blankets, hats and windbreakers to keep warm. But temperatures at the opening ceremony were warmer than expected at 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and some athletes appeared unfazed.  What happened at the Olympics opening ceremony?  As in every Olympics opening ceremony since 1908, athletes marched into the stadium under their country’s flag during the Parade of Nations. Olympic athletes from North and South Korea marched together under a single flag — a historic diplomatic decision that caused some controversy.  Even before North and South Korea agreed to unite, organizers had planned for the Olympics opening ceremony to have a theme of peace. Korean musicians performed John Lennon’s “Imagine,” surrounded by lights in the shape of a dove.  “We have worked on all of our scenarios under the theme of peace,” Song Seung-whan, the executive creative director for the opening ceremony, said at a press conference in January, according to Reuters. “Although North Korea’s participation was decided belatedly, we think this will serve as a good opportunity for us to convey our message more clearly.”  More than a thousand drones lit up the sky in the shape of the Olympics rings, above a show that featured 1,300 performers and 700 volunteers at one point, the New York Times reported. South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim lit the Olympic cauldron after performing a short skating routine.  Pita Taufatofua — the oiled-up Tongan flag-bearer who became a social media sensation during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics — is competing in PyeongChang as a cross-country skier. He carried his country’s flag at Friday’s opening ceremony, stealing the show once again with the same shirtless uniform despite freezing temperatures.  Team USA weathered those bitter temperatures by wearing heated parkas as they paraded into the Olympic stadium. The uniforms, which feature American flags made of heat-conductive ink, were designed by Polo Ralph Lauren, the official outfitter for the 2018 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams.  Who attended the opening ceremony?  The U.S. delegation to the Olympics is led by Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the opening ceremony with his wife, Karen Pence. The delegation also includes California Rep. Ed Royce and 2002 Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes. Joining them are Gen. Vincent Brooks, who commands the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea; his predecessor, Gen. James Thurman; and Marc Knapper, a diplomat currently leading the U.S. embassy in Seoul.  Earlier in the day, Pence met with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier — the father of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea. Fred Warmbier had also been scheduled to attend the opening ceremony as Pence’s guest, the Washington Post reported. The Warmbiers attended this year’s State of the Union address by President Trump, who pointed to them as “powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world.”  Kim Jong Un sent his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, to the opening ceremony as part of the North Korean delegation, which is led by Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea’s parliament. The unprecedented visit marked the first time an immediate member of the Kim family has been to South Korea. It’s not clear if any of the North Korean representatives will meet Pence or other U.S. officials at the Olympics, though they were seated near each other at the opening ceremony. “We’ll have to see what happens,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said when asked about it on Monday, according to Reuters.  Meanwhile, President Trump and Kim Jong Un were represented at the opening ceremony by two impersonators in the stands, who caused a stir and were asked to leave.

0,"The daughter of one of the most fashionable forces to be reckoned with would naturally have a pretty eye-catching engagement ring — and Bee Shaffer did not disappoint when she debuted her rock on the red carpet on Monday night.  The 29-year-old daughter recently got engaged to 34-year-old Francesco Carrozzini — who, as the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, is also fashion family royalty — and the lovebirds made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala.  Bee certainly looked stunning in her silk Alexander McQueen floor-sweeper, which featured a patchwork of painted designs — but it was her bling that was the most noteworthy item of her ensemble.  Rockin' that rock! Bee Shaffer showed off her engagement ring on the red carpet for the first time on Monday night  In love: The 29-year-old also made her red carpet debut with her fiancé, Francesco Carrozzini  Lover here! Though her necklace and earrings were undoubtedly pricey, it was her diamond - encircled by smaller diamonds and set in yellow gown - that was the most eye-catching  Striking: She wore a patchwork Alexander McQueen number for the occasion  The public first found out that Bee was engaged in March, thanks to an Instagram photo that offered viewers a glimpse at the ring.  Shared in her friend Selby Drummond's Instagram Story, the black-and-white snap showed Bee trying on some shoes in what appears to be a fashion closet at Vogue, and added the hashtag #francescoblackandwhite — a hashtag Francesco uses often on his own Instagram.  Eagle-eyed 'grammers caught the flash of diamond in the snap, at Vogue later confirmed the news.  Now, a month and a half later, the duo has gone totally public, walking together on the red carpet at the Met Gala.  Love-dovey: Her husband-to-bee, Francesco, kept her close as they posed for the camera  Surprise! The two got engaged earlier this year and had been secretly dating for a while  Offspring: Francesco is the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Carrozzini  Francesco, in a blue tux, kept his wife to be close with hand around her waist as they face the photographers. Bee, meanwhile, occasionally posed with her left hand on her hip, offering the cameras an obscured look at her diamond.  The ring features an unusually think, flat yellow gold setting and a large, round center stone, which is surrounded by 14 smaller stones.  Whether the ring is by a famous jeweler or a family heirloom is as yet unknown.  Basking in their first appearance since agreeing to get hitched, the couple walked the carpet toward the Wintour Costume Center, which was re-named after the Vogue editrix in 2014.  Iconic: Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour opted for a multi-textured dress that featured sequins, fur and embroidery  All hail: The Met Gala chair dazzled in her gown as her daughter took the carpet with Francesco  Bee's mom Anna, meanwhile, wore a custom Chanel dress covered in glitzy sequins. As is her habit, the host eschewed the theme — Rei Kawakubo/Commes Des Garcons: Art of the In-Between — and stuck to her signature classic, feminine style.  She finished off her look with a chunky necklace, a pretty pink lip, and her trademark sleek bob — choosing, wisely, to leave her infamous dark sunglasses at home for the ritzy occasion.  Bee and her husband-to-be were first linked just last year, soon before his mother, Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, passed away in December following a year-long illness.  Stunning: Bee made quite the impression as she showed off the long train of her dress on the stairs leading up to the gala event  Whoops! News of their engagement was made public in March when a friend shared this picture of Bee - and her ring - on her Instagram story  Franca, who died before Christmas at the age of 66, had edited Italian Vogue since 1988, taking up the position in the same month that Anna took over Vogue in the US.  Anna wrote a heartfelt letter of remembrance after Franca's passing, saying of her friend: 'Franca was warm, clever, funny, and someone who could give the Sphinx a run for its money when it comes to keeping a confidence.  'She was also the hardest-working person I have known, and with an envy-inducing ease with multitasking.'"

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Elon and I had a beautiful relationship, and we have a beautiful friendship now, one that was based on our core values,” she said.  As for what drew the two together, the actress said the two bonded over “intellectual curiosity, ideas and conversation, a shared love for science.”  “We just bonded on a lot of things that speak to who I am on the inside,” Heard explained. “I have so much respect for him.”  While the two remain good friends, Heard shared a bit of insight at the Tesla CEO’s meltdowns, saying, “He’s not boring.”  amber-heard Amber Heard and Elon Musk | Credit: Media-Mode/Splash News  Heard and Musk were first linked together in 2016 as each was weathering a public breakup: Heard and Johnny Depp finalized their divorce in January, while Musk filed for divorce from Westworld actress Talulah Riley in early 2015.  The two first broke up in August 2017 due to their busy schedules but rekindled their romance in January 2018 only to split for a second time a month later.  “Elon decided it was time to end it and Amber agreed,” a source close to the couple told PEOPLE at the time. “They both still care deeply for each other but the timing wasn’t right.”  Despite ending things in August, they were spotted out together in Australia just days after news of their split emerged.  “Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think,” Musk told Rolling Stone in a story published three months later. “I was really in love, and it hurt bad.”  RELATED VIDEO: Elon Musk’s Estranged Father Had a Baby with His Stepdaughter  Musk also said that he “cannot be happy” without a girlfriend.  “‘I never want to be alone.’ That’s what I would say,” he explained. “I don’t want to be alone.”  Despite having a successful career, he said his life feels empty without someone to share it with."
0,"Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. “I’m sorry you feel that way … I thought it turned out incredible,” he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The “race” constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark’s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than César Cielo’s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.  Regardless of Phelps’ abilities, Discovery’s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers’ sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:  Turns out “Michael Phelps races a shark” was really just “Michael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark’s time.” — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017  Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB — Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017  Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform — Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017  “All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn’t a side by side race,” said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. “During Michael’s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‘Phelps vs. Shark,’ this message was clear.”  Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. “I’m sorry you feel that way … It’s hard to swim in a cage when you’re next to a shark … It wouldn’t be able to move at the right speed. So how we did it was the best way that we could do it.”  While the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of great white sharks (just check out this GIF of Phelps reacting to how easily a great white would win gold). Even though Phelps lost by a hair in this would-be race, to Phelps’ credit, he could take down a reef shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds.  “Rematch?” Phelps tweeted after “losing” to the ocean predator. But the real question: would anyone bother to watch?"

On Friday, Taylor deleted all previous posts and her profile pictures from her Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  Even Taylor’s website was a blank space!  Now she’s posted a 10 second dark video with no audio of what looks like an animal’s tail.  What does it all mean? Another album? We're not sure yet but it's certainly whipped fans into a frenzy!  Taylor has avoided the public eye ever since her spat with Kanye West and break up with British actor Tom Hiddleston.  Swift’s last album was 2014’s ‘1989’, her last single was her ‘I Don’t Wanna Live Forever’ collab with ZAYN in January for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack."

Former “Once Upon a Time” stars Jennifer Morrison, Ginner Goodwin, Josh Dallas, and Emilie de Ravin have all been confirmed to return for the show’s final episode, which is set to air on May 18.  All four of the actors departed the ABC fairy tale series after its sixth season. Morrison played Emma Swan in the series, while Goodwin played Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. Dallas starred as Prince Charming/David Nolan, and de Ravin played Belle/Lacey.  The four are the latest former cast members to book returns for the show’s finale. Previously, Tony Amendola, Lee Arenberg, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Robbie Kay, Sean Maguire, Victoria Smurfit, Keegan Tracy, Beverley Elliott, and Jared Gilmore were all confirmed to appear in the final two episodes.  ABC announced in February that “Once Upon a Time’s” seventh season would be the show’s last. The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season. The show also moved from its longtime Sunday night timeslot to Fridays, where it has suffered a noticeable ratings decline. Season 7 is currently averaging a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers, down over 40% in the demo and over 20% in total viewers from Season 6."

Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.  Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?  The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.  “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”  He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”  “There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  Valid point, Mr. Theroux.

0,"“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.  One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.  The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”"
0,"Photography via Getty  Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — shooters for krisdeana (@belizafucked) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber ? #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  ?| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — ? (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best."

A new lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses the entrepreneur of rape, according to reports from The New York Times and Billboard. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.  Per the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.

0,"American attorney and businessman  This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (October 27, 1917 – December 9, 2012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (July 15, 1917 – May 21, 2008), both Armenian Americans.[1] He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas ""Tom"" Kardashian.[2][3] The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire.[4] Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.  He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived on 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue.[5] Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Simpson was the best man at Robert Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978. Robert was the water boy for the USC Trojans football team which would be ranked #1 in the nation in the AP Poll.[citation needed]  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense ""Dream Team"", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: ""I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.""[16] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at age 59,[18] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[19]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[20]  Personal life  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Rob.[21]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[22][23][24] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children ""were instrumental"" in the demise of the relationship.[25][26][27] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (née Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[28][17]  See also"
0,"Abby Lee Miller has a new projected release date from the Victorville, California prison — almost one full month earlier than when she was initially scheduled to be released — according to the Bureau of Prisons.  The 52-year-old former Dance Moms star was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison in May 2017 for bankruptcy fraud. However, due to good behavior, her initial release date of June 21 has been moved up. Her new date is now projected to be May 25, which “includes credit for good conduct time that may be earned throughout the remainder of her sentence,” the bureau told Us Weekly on Friday, March 16.  Us Weekly caught up with former mentee of Miller’s, Nia Sioux, at the Midnight Sun premiere on Thursday, March 15, who dished on leaving her former Dance Moms life behind. “Probably not,” Sioux told Us about the possibility of reconnecting with Miller post-jail. “Never say never, but I’ve pretty much distanced myself for a while.”  The 16-year-old dancer did, however, reveal that she “really learned so much from” Miller. She added: “I think one thing that I take from working with her is I learned how to deal with difficult people, with different types of people.”  As previously reported, the reality star was also sentenced for not reporting the $120,000 worth of Australian currency that she had brought into the United States. Along with prison time, she was fined $40,000 along with a $120,000 judgment, and ordered to two years of supervised release.  In December 2017, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that the Abby Lee Dance Company owner had completed a prison Release Preparation Program as well as received a certificate in personal finance."
0,"It’s complicated for Teen Mom 2’s Kailyn Lowry. The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn’t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child’s father is Chris Lopez.)  The 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac’s life— she doesn’t feel it’s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.  “I don’t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln’s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don’t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,” the mom shared with Radar.  And while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.  “I didn’t ask how he was handling it,” she explained to the outlet. “But he did say congratulations.”  Making things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn’t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.  Attorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry’s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: “Delaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.”  In order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to “discharge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.”  The pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.  But the MTV star doesn’t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. “Javi is not the father,” she explained to Radar. “Chris is the father so I think we’re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that’s established.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page."

Her repeated donation under Pence’s name is not a “prank,” she said, but a way to peacefully protest while supporting the organization.  ""I don't look at it as a prank,"" Kunis said. ""I literally -- I strongly disagree -- and this is my little way of showing it. It's a peaceful protest.""  Before she went into detail about her donations, the former “That 70s Show” star told Conan that she might get “a lot of hate mail” and she apologized if her actions offended anyone.  ""It's not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do,"" Kunis said.  ""So as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.""  This was met with loud applause from the audience.  ""Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says, 'an anonymous donation has been made in your name,'"" Kunis said."

Lauer released a statement after his termination as well as an apology, saying: ""There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry... Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.

But is a 100+ or a 90+ sunscreen really that much better than one with an SPF of 30?  SPF refers to the ability of a sunscreen to block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, which cause sunburns, but not UVA rays, which are more closely linked to deeper skin damage. Both UVA and UVB contribute to the risk of skin cancer.  The SPF rating is a measure of the time it would take you to sunburn if you were not wearing sunscreen as opposed to the time it would take with sunscreen on.  ""SPF is not a consumer-friendly number,"" says Florida dermatologist James M. Spencer, MD. ""It is logical for someone to think that an SPF of 30 is twice as good as an SPF of 15 and so on. But that is not how it works.""  According to Spencer, an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays.  ""After that, it just gets silly,"" he says.  Sunscreens with higher SPF ratings block slightly more UVB rays, but none offers 100% protection.  Spencer recommends SPF 30 products to his patients.  Farah Ahmed, who is general counsel for the cosmetics industry group Personal Care Products Council, concedes that the difference in sunburn protection between the medium- and high-SPF sunscreens is not great.  But, she says, the high SPF products may protect better against long-term skin damage and exposure-related skin cancers.  Whatever product you choose, experts recommend using a water-resistant sunscreen applied liberally one half hour before going outdoors. Sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours or after swimming, drying off, or sweating.  ""The best way make sure you are protected is to reapply sunscreen often,"" Spencer says. ""You just can't put it on in the morning and forget about it. I don't care if it's SPF 800 or the best UVA protection, after a few hours it's gone."""1,"Erin Jensen  USA TODAY  Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.  “I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago.

The ""Dance Moms"" star share that she completed several classes while serving time for bankruptcy fraud.  Miller earned certificates in personal finance and real estate. She posted the photos on Instagram and stated that she's ""feeling extremely proud"" of her accomplishments. Miller received both certificates on Dec. 15.  The ""Dance Moms"" teacher entered the Victorville Federal Correctional Institution in July where she's expected to serve her sentence for 366 days. A California judge found her guilty of hiding money in secret bank accounts after filing for bankruptcy in 2016.  Miller, who earned a reputation as a tyrannical dance instructor on ""Dance Moms,"" has since expressed regrets over the fraud she committed. She told E!

I just made mistakes and I was stupid.""  Before her incarceration, Miller expressed fears she could be raped or physically abused while in prison. She admitted that she cried every day out of fear. She thought about learning self-defense.  In reality, prison life for Miller is far from what she imagined and feared. She's still able to keep in touch with her followers on social media. She's also rumored to have a pen pal in the person of an older man and she's getting along with the lesbian inmates.  Miller, however, hopes to get back to her show once she completes prison time.

0,"Not to be confused with The Handmaiden  1985 novel by Margaret Atwood  The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, totalitarian theocratic state, known as Gilead, that has overthrown the United States government. The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the group known as ""handmaids"", who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the ""commanders"" – the ruling class of men.  The novel explores themes of subjugated women in a patriarchal society and the various means by which they resist and attempt to gain individuality and independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of connected stories (such as ""The Merchant's Tale"" and ""The Parson's Tale"").[7]  The Handmaid's Tale won the 1985 Governor General's Award and the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and the 1987 Prometheus Award. The book has been adapted into a 1990 film, a 2000 opera, a 2017 television series, and other media.  In 1987, the ebook version was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[8][9]  In 2019, a sequel novel, The Testaments, was published.  Plot summary [ edit ]  After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the ""Sons of Jacob"" uses theonomic ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution is suspended, newspapers are censored, and what was formerly the United States of America is changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead. The new regime moves quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including traditional Christian denominations. In addition, the regime reorganizes society using a peculiar interpretation of some Old Testament ideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and religious fanaticism among its newly created social classes. Above all, the biggest change is the severe limitation of people's rights, especially those of women, who are not allowed to read, write, own property, or handle money. Most significantly, women are deprived of control over their own reproductive functions.  The story is told in first-person narration by a woman named Offred. In this era of environmental pollution and radiation, she is one of the few remaining fertile women. Therefore, she is forcibly assigned to produce children for the ""Commanders,"" the ruling class of men, and is known as a ""Handmaid"" based on the biblical story of Rachel and her handmaid Bilhah. Apart from Handmaids, other women are also classed socially and follow a strict dress code, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders' Wives in blue; the Handmaids in red with white veils around their faces; the Aunts (who train and indoctrinate the Handmaids) in brown; the Marthas (cooks and maids) in green; Econowives (the wives of lower-ranking men who handle everything in the domestic sphere) in blue, red and green stripes; young, unmarried girls in white; and widows in black.  Offred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersed with her narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, including her failed attempt to escape to Canada with her husband and child, her indoctrination into life as a Handmaid by the Aunts, and the escape of her friend Moira from the indoctrination facility. At her new home, she is treated poorly by the Commander's wife, a former Christian media personality named Serena Joy who supported women's domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established. To Offred's surprise, the Commander requests to see her outside of the ""Ceremony,"" a reproductive ritual obligatory for handmaids and intended to result in conception in the presence of his wife. The two begin an illegal relationship where they play Scrabble and Offred is allowed to ask favors of him, whether in terms of information or material items. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a covert, government-run brothel called Jezebel's. Offred unexpectedly encounters Moira there, with her will broken, and she learns that those who are found breaking the law are sent to the Colonies to clean up toxic waste or are allowed to work at Jezebel's as punishment.  In the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns from her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, of the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Not knowing of Offred's criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that the Commander is infertile, and arranges for Offred to begin a covert sexual relationship with Nick, the Commander's personal servant. After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well, with Offred discovering that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. However, shortly after, Ofglen disappears (reported as a suicide), and Serena finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander, which causes Offred to contemplate suicide.  Offred tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing the uniform of the secret police, the Eyes of God, known informally as ""the Eyes"", to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. It is unclear whether the men are actually Eyes or members of the Mayday resistance. Offred is still unsure if Nick is a member of Mayday or an Eye posing as one, and does not know if leaving will result in her escape or her capture. Ultimately, she enters the van with her future uncertain.  The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue, described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The keynote speaker explains that Offred's account of the events of the novel was recorded onto cassette tapes later found and transcribed by historians studying what is then called ""the Gilead Period"".  Background [ edit ]  Fitting with her statements that The Handmaid's Tale is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s. Her motivation for writing the novel was her belief that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the Moral Majority, Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition and the Ronald Reagan administration.[10] Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially ""casually held attitudes about women"" were taken to their logical end.[11] Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid's Tale have actually occurred in real life—in an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that ""As with The Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.""[12] Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality.[13] Atwood has explained that The Handmaid's Tale is a response to those who say the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years ""can't happen here""—but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.[14]  Atwood was also inspired by the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1978-79 that saw a theocracy established that drastically reduced the rights of women and imposed a strict dress code on Iranian women, very much like that of Gilead. In The Handmaid's Tale, a reference is made to the Islamic Republic of Iran in the form of the history book Iran and Gilead: Two Late Twentieth Century Monotheocracies mentioned in the endnotes describing the historians' convention in 2195. Atwood's picture of a society ruled by men who professed high moral principles, but are in fact self-interested and selfish was inspired by observing Canadian politicians in action, especially in her hometown of Toronto, who frequently profess in a very sanctimonious manner to be acting from the highest principles of morality while in reality the opposite is the case. During the Second World War, Canadian women took on jobs in the place of men serving in the military that they were expected to yield to men once the war was over; after 1945, not all women wanted to return to their traditional roles as housewives and mothers, leading to a male backlash. Atwood was born in 1939 and while growing up in the 1950s she saw first-hand the complaints against women who continued to work after 1945 and of women who unhappily gave up their jobs, which she incorporated into her novel. The way in which the narrator is forced into becoming an unhappy house-wife after she loses her job in common with all the other women of Gilead was inspired by Atwood's memories of the 1950s.  Atwood's inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her study of early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.[11] Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans—that they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant society—is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theocracy where religious dissent would not be tolerated.[11] Atwood also had a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging.[17] Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadan society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th century régimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[18] Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends.[18][19]  Atwood, with respect to those leading Gilead, further stated:[20]  I don't consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity … and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be 'I was sick and you visited me not' and such and such …And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbor or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. … Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.  In the same vein, Atwood also declared that ""In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.""[7] Atwood also draws connections between the ways in which Gilead's leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Afghanistan as an example of a religious theocracy forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.[13][11] The ""state-sanctioned murder of dissidents"" was inspired by the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos , and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceaușescu's obsession with increasing the birth rate (Decree 770) led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion.[13] However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these deplorable acts were not just present in other cultures and countries, ""but within Western society, and within the 'Christian' tradition itself"".[18]  The Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred's services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are ""untouchable"", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.[18] Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and venereal disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the ""Historical Notes"" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood's writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood's strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her MaddAddam trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.[21]  Characters [ edit ]  Offred [ edit ]  Offred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labeled a ""wanton woman"" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a ""handmaid"" in the home of ""the Commander"" and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).[22] Readers are able to see Offred's resistance of The Republic of Gilead on the inside through her thoughts.  Offred is a slave name that describes her function: she is ""of Fred"" (i.e., she belongs to Fred – presumed to be the name of the Commander – and is considered a concubine). In the novel, Offred says that she is not a concubine, but a tool; a ""two legged womb"". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander's property. ""Offred"" is also a pun on the word ""offered"", as in ""offered as a sacrifice"", and ""of red"" because the red dress assigned for the handmaids in Gilead.[7]  In Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed; however, Volker Schlöndorff's 1990 film adaptation gave Offred the real name Kate,[23] while the television series gave her the real name June.  The women in training to be Handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are ""Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June,"" and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop ""mooning and June-ing"". From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be ""June"".[25] Miner suggests that ""June"" is a pseudonym. As ""Mayday"" is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the protagonist. The Nunavut conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June.[26] When the Hulu TV series chose to state outright that Offred's real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred's real name is June ""but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish"".[7] The revelation of Offred's real name serves only to humanize her in the presence of the other Handmaids.  The Commander [ edit ]  The Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar to market research before Gilead's inception. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is ""Fred"", though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing Scrabble, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.  In the epilogue, Professor Peixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name ""Fred"". It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.  Serena Joy [ edit ]  Serena Joy is a former televangelist and the Commander's wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. The state took away her power and public recognition, and tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air. Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a handmaid. She resents having to take part in ""The Ceremony"", a monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, ""Serena Joy"" or ""Pam"" are pseudonyms; the character's real name is implied to be Thelma.  Ofglen [ edit ]  Ofglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.  A new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. In addition, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the first Ofglen.  Nick [ edit ]  Nick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.  Moira [ edit ]  Moira has been a close friend of Offred's since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted the homophobia of Gilead society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.  Luke [ edit ]  Luke was Offred's husband before the formation of Gilead, having divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter illegitimate. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.  Professor Pieixoto [ edit ]  Pieixoto is the ""co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes"". In his presentation at an academic conference, he talks about ""the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid's Tale'"".[22] Pieixoto is therefore the person who is retelling Offred's story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.  Setting [ edit ]  The novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005,[27] with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.  The action takes place in what once was the Harvard Square neighbourhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts;[29] Atwood studied at Radcliffe College, located in this area.  Symbols [ edit ]  Flowers [ edit ]  The flowers in The Handmaid’s Tale are representative of fertility and beauty. Flowers in the novel are capable of blooming while woman cannot. In the past, the flowers act as a reminder of fertility.[30]  The Handmaid’s Red [ edit ]  Handmaids in the novel wear a red uniform symbolizing fertility. The color red is symbolic of childbirth and the process of menstruation. The color red portrays sin through the adulturous acts of the Handmaids with their Commanders. [31]  The Eyes [ edit ]  Gilead’s secret police serve as the “Eyes of God.” They serve to symbolize excessive watchfulness. The Eyes mean the characters are always being watched by God. [32]  Politics [ edit ]  In Gilead, the bodies of fertile women are politicized and controlled. The North American population is falling as more men and women become infertile (though in Gilead, legally, it is only women who can be the cause of infertility). Gilead's treatment of women is based upon a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, meaning that women are the property of and subordinate to their husband, father, or head of household. They are not allowed to do anything that would grant them any power independent of this system. They are not allowed to vote, hold a job, read, possess money, or own anything, among many other restrictions.  A particular quote from The Handmaid's Tale sums this up: ""The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within you"" (HT 5.2). This describes that there is no way around the societal bounds of women in this new state of government. Handmaids, being not allowed to wed, are given two-year assignments with a commander, and lose their own name: they are called ""Of [their Commander's first name]"", such as the novel's protagonist, known only as Offred. When a handmaid is reassigned, her name changes with her. Their original identities are suppressed. However, while being re-educated as handmaids, they surreptitiously share their names with each other.  In this book, the government appears to be strong though ""no one in Gilead seems to be a true believer in its revolution"" (Beauchamp). The Commanders, portrayed via Commander Fred, do not agree with their own doctrines. The commander takes Offred at one point to a brothel in order to have sex with her in an informal setting apart from the Ceremony. The wives, portrayed via Serena Joy, former television evangelist, disobey the rules set forth by their commander husbands. Serena smokes black market cigarettes, expresses the forbidden idea that men may be infertile, and schemes to get Offred impregnated by her chauffeur.  Religion [ edit ]  Bruce Miller, the executive producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is ""a society that’s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes"".[33] The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[18] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are ""not genuinely Christian"".[34][33] The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is ""not really interested in religion; they're interested in power.""[20] In fact, in her prayers to God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays ""I don't believe for an instant that what's going on out there is what You meant.... I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever they’re doing now. I’ll try, but it isn't easy.""[35] Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that ""Offred herself has a private version of the Lord's Prayer and refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God.""[7]  Christian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seen attending church.[33] Christian denominations, including Quakers, Baptists and Roman Catholics, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob.[20][33] Nuns who refuse conversion are considered ""Unwomen"" and banished to the Colonies, owing to their reluctance to marry and refusal (or inability) to bear children. Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall. Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: ""The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as—I suspect—they would.""[7]  Jews are named an exception and classified Sons of Jacob. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the ""repatriation program"" and capitalists' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught secretly practicing Judaism and executed.  Legitimate women [ edit ]  Wives The top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers. Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary in historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes a Widow and must dress in black.  Daughters The natural or adopted children of the ruling class. They wear white until marriage, which is arranged by the government. The narrator's daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.  [7] The bonnets that Handmaids wear are modelled on Old Dutch Cleanser's faceless mascot, which Atwood in childhood found frightening.  Fertile women whose social function is to bear children for infertile Wives. Handmaids dress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy white bonnets, which they call ""wings"" because the sides stick out, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism; and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1–13 and Genesis 16:1–4. In the first story, Jacob's infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaid Bilhah to be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaid Zilpah (even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife's handmaid, Hagar. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centers. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their commander's house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment. Those who do produce children, however, will never be declared ""Unwomen"" or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.  Aunts Trainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honorable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They also police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role. (""The Aunts are allowed to read and write."" Vintage Books, p. 139. However, on p. 100 of the Vintage Books edition: ""They played it (the Beatitudes) from a disc; the voice was a man's."" In the Anchor Books edition: ""They played it (the Beatitudes) from a tape, so not even an Aunt would be guilty of the sin of reading. The voice was a man's. (p.89.)"")  Marthas They are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants. They dress in green smocks. The title of ""Martha"" is based on the story of Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary (Gospel of Luke 10:38–42), where Jesus visits Mary, sister of Lazarus and Martha; Mary listens to Jesus while Martha works at ""all the preparations that had to be made"".  Econowives Women married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.  The division of labour among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other. They are divided in their oppression.  The Ceremony [ edit ]  ""The Ceremony"" is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:  My red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for.  Genre classification [ edit ]  The Handmaid’s Tale is a feminist dystopian novel,[37][38] combining the characteristics of dystopian fiction: ""a genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author’s own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worse because it attempts to reify some utopian ideal,""[39] with the feminist utopian ideal which: ""sees men or masculine systems as the major cause of social and political problems (e.g. war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions.[40][41] The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction notes that dystopian images are almost invariably images of future society, ""pointing fearfully at the way the world is supposedly going in order to provide urgent propaganda for a change in direction.""[42] Atwood's stated intent was indeed to dramatize potential consequences of current trends.[43]  In 1985, reviewers hailed the book as a ""feminist 1984,""[44] citing similarities between the totalitarian regimes under which both protagonists live, and ""the distinctively modern sense of nightmare come true, the initial paralyzed powerlessness of the victim unable to act.""[45] Scholarly studies have expanded on the place of The Handmaid’s Tale in the dystopian and feminist traditions.[45][11][46][12][44]  The classification of utopian and dystopian fiction as a sub-genre of the collective term, speculative fiction, alongside science fiction, fantasy, and horror is a relatively recent convention. (See also: The Internet Speculative Fiction Database) Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction, however, with publication of The Handmaid's Tale, Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:  I like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction. For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do, such as going through a wormhole in space to another universe; and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand, such as DNA identification and credit cards, and that takes place on Planet Earth. But the terms are fluid.[47]  Atwood acknowledges that others may use the terms interchangeably, but she notes her interest in this type of work is to explore themes in ways that ""realistic fiction"" cannot do.[47]  Among a few science fiction aficionados, however, Atwood's comments were considered petty and contemptuous. (The term speculative fiction was indeed employed that way by certain New Wave writers in the 1960s and early 1970s to express their dissatisfaction with traditional or establishment science fiction.) Hugo-winning science fiction critic David Langford observed in a column: ""The Handmaid's Tale won the very first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987. She's been trying to live this down ever since.""[48]  Critical reception [ edit ]  The Handmaid's Tale was well received by critics, helping to cement Atwood's status as a prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia.[10] Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale.[49] Indeed, many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World,[13] with the added feature of confronting patriarchy, a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.[14]  Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood's novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact.[17][19] Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the ""cautionary tale"" Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy's New York Times review argued that The Handmaid's Tale lacked the ""surprised recognition"" necessary for readers to see ""our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue"".[21]  The 2017 television series led to debate on whether parallels could be drawn between the series (and book) and America during the presidency of Donald Trump.[50]  Analysis [ edit ]  Feminist analysis [ edit ]  Much of the discussion about The Handmaid's Tale has centered on its categorization as feminist literature. Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.[18] Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: ""shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife"".[18] Econowives are women married to men that don't belong to the elite and who are expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist. However, she was adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.[51] Additionally, Atwood has argued that while some of the observations that informed the content of The Handmaid's Tale may be feminist, her novel is not meant to say ""one thing to one person"" or serve as a political message—instead, The Handmaid's Tale is ""a study of power, and how it operates and how it deforms or shapes the people who are living within that kind of regime"".[13][14]  Some scholars have offered such a feminist interpretation, however, connecting Atwood's use of religious fundamentalism in the pages of The Handmaid's Tale to a condemnation of their presence in current American society.[52][53] Atwood goes on to describe her book as not a critique of religion, but a critique of the use of religion as a ""front for tyranny.""[54] Yet others have argued that The Handmaid's Tale critiques typical notions of feminism, as Atwood's novel appears to subvert the traditional ""women helping women"" ideals of the movement and turn toward the possibility of ""the matriarchal network ... and a new form of misogyny: women's hatred of women"".[55] Scholars have analyzed and made connections to patriarchal oppression in The Handmaid's Tale and oppression of women today. Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in The Handmaid's Tale. She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and their Commander, explaining that through this ""perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally."" Their relationship and other similar relationships in The Handmaid's Tale mirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.[56]  Sex and occupation [ edit ]  In the world of The Handmaid's Tale, the sexes are strictly divided. Gilead's society values white women's reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized ""hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity"" as well as ""metonymically colour-coded according to their function and their labour"" (Kauffman 232). The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.  Women are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exception, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All ""non-persons"" are banished to the ""Colonies"". Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.  The women, particularly the handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned commander's first name in most cases. This hierarchical society has forced women to come to terms with their inability to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.  Unwomen [ edit ]  Sterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable of social integration within the Republic's strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to ""the Colonies"", areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.  Jezebels [ edit ]  Jezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women. Jezebels, whose title also comes from the Bible (note Queen Jezebel in the Books of Kings), dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from ""the time before"", such as cheerleaders' costumes, school uniforms, and Playboy Bunny costumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime and/or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies in the novel.  Race analysis [ edit ]  African Americans, the main non-white ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated ""en masse"" to ""National Homelands"" in the Midwest, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa. Ana Cottle characterized The Handmaid's Tale as ""white feminism"", noting that Atwood does away with black people in a few lines by relocating the ""Children of Ham"" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to white women.[57][58] It is implied that Native Americans living in territories under the rule of Gilead are exterminated. Jews are given a choice between converting to the state religion or being ""repatriated"" to Israel. However, converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts of Judaism were executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized.  Many argue that readers cannot simply ignore the parallels between racism and sexism within The Handmaid's Tale. Many critics believe that Atwood chooses to erase the black community from the novel by sending them elsewhere in order to make the Republic of Gilead a white society. Scholar Ben Merriman believes that Atwood's portrayal of society in The Handmaid's Tale mimics that of a society run on black slavery, due to the novel's heavy focuses on ""sexual exploitation, isolation, and compelled ignorance that accompany severe economic and political powerlessness"", which are themes often associated with African-American slavery. Merriman accuses Atwood of purposely failing to acknowledge the parallels between her novel and the African-American experience. In Gilead, Handmaids are forbidden to read or write and the men in charge control access to literacy. In black slavery, African-Americans had restrictions on literacy as well. Additionally, The Handmaid's Tale is written as an oral narration of Offred's experiences; oral narration is a theme commonly associated with slave narratives.[59]  Language analysis [ edit ]  In the novel's fictional fundamentalist society, sterile is an outlawed word. In this society, there is no such thing as a sterile man. In this culture, women are either fruitful or barren, the latter of which are declared to be ""unwomen"" and are sent to the colonies with the rest of the ""unwomen"" to do life-threatening work until their death, which is, on average, three years.  Atwood emphasises how changes in context affect behaviours and attitudes by repeating the phrase ""Context is all"" throughout the novel, establishing this precept as a motif. Playing the game of Scrabble with her Commander illustrates the key significance of changes in ""context""; once ""the game of old men and women"", the game became forbidden for women to play and therefore ""desirable"". Through living in a morally rigid society, Offred has come to perceive the world differently from earlier. Offred expresses amazement at how ""It has taken so little time to change our minds about things"". Wearing revealing clothes and makeup had been part of her former life, but when she sees Japanese tourists dressed that way, she now feels the women are inappropriately dressed.  Offred can read but not translate the phrase ""nolite te bastardes carborundorum"" carved into the closet wall of her small bedroom; this mock-Latin aphorism signifies ""Don't let the bastards grind you down"".  Awards [ edit ]  Academic reception [ edit ]  Atwood's novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction, The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the North American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year.[71] As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents. Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since.[72]  Challenges [ edit ]  Many people have expressed discontent at The Handmaid's Tale's presence in the classroom. Some of these challenges have come from parents concerned about the explicit sexuality and other adult themes represented in the book. Others have argued that The Handmaid's Tale depicts a negative view of religion, a view supported by several academics who propose that Atwood's work satirizes contemporary religious fundamentalists in the United States, offering a feminist critique of the trends this movement to the Right represents.[52][53]  The American Library Association (ALA) lists The Handmaid's Tale as number 37 on the ""100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000"".[73] In 2019, The Handmaid's Tale is still listed as the seventh-most challenged book because of profanity, vulgarity, and sexual overtones.[74] Atwood participated in discussing The Handmaid's Tale as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled ""One Book, One Conference"".[75]  Some complaints have included:  2009 Toronto District School Board. Report in The Star, 16 January 2009: ""Atwood novel too brutal, sexist for school: Parent"", by Kristin Rushowy, Education Reporter.  The Handmaid's Tale wasn't likely written for 17-year-olds, but neither are a lot of things we teach in high school, like Shakespeare... And they are all the better for reading it. They are on the edge of adulthood already, and there's no point in coddling them,"" he said, adding, ""they aren't coddled in terms of mass media today anyway""... He said the book has been accused of being anti-Christian and, more recently, anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed... But that ""misses the point"", said Brown. ""It's really anti-fundamentalism.""[76]  In her earlier account (14 January 2009), Star reporter Kristin Rushowy commented that a Toronto District School Board committee was ""reviewing the novel"". While noting that ""The Handmaid's Tale is listed as one of the 100 'most frequently challenged books' from 1990 to 1999 on the American Library Association's website"", Rushowy reports that ""The Canadian Library Association says there is 'no known instance of a challenge to this novel in Canada' but says the book was called anti-Christian and pornographic by parents after being placed on a reading list for secondary students in Texas in the 1990s.""[77]  2012: Challenged as required reading for a Page High School International Baccalaureate class and as optional reading for Advanced Placement reading courses at Grimsley High School in Greensboro, North Carolina because the book is ""sexually explicit, violently graphic and morally corrupt"". Some parents thought the book is “detrimental to Christian values"". [78]  November 2012 Guilford County, North Carolina, where two parents protested against the inclusion of the book on a required reading list at a local high school. The parents presented the school board with a petition signed by 2,300 people, prompting a review of the book by the school's media advisory committee. According to local news reports, one of the parents said ""she felt Christian students are bullied in society, in that they're made to feel uncomfortable about their beliefs by non-believers. She said including books like The Handmaid's Tale contributes to that discomfort, because of its negative view on religion and its anti-biblical attitudes toward sex.""[79]  In higher education [ edit ]  In institutions of higher education, professors have found The Handmaid's Tale to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood's captivating delivery. The novel's teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way;[80][81] demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political;[82] and acknowledging the ""most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history"" in a compelling manner.[83] The chapter entitled ""Historical Notes"" at the end of the novel also represents a warning to academics who run the risk of misreading and misunderstanding historical texts, pointing to the satirized Professor Pieixoto as an example of a male scholar who has taken over and overpowered Offred's narrative with his own interpretation.[84]  In other media [ edit ]  Audio [ edit ]  An audiobook of the unabridged text, read by Claire Danes ( ISBN 9781491519110), won the 2013 Audie Award for fiction.

'Happy Birthday, baby,' Lively wrote alongside a pic of Ryan Gosling and a cropped out Reynolds at the Critics' Choice Awards in 2016.

0,"Ready for the return of The Black Eyed Peas? So are we! However, you may notice the line-up has changed a bit since we last saw them. Just a few days ago rumours started circulating that Fergie was possibly leaving the band, and that Nicole Scherzinger was replacing her. And now Ahlan! can reveal what’s REALLY going…  We spoke to The Black Eyed Peas (will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap) ahead of their concert at the opening ceremony of the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff. Sadly, yes, Fergie has left the band. will.i.am explained the situation to us: “Since the beginning of Black Eyed Peas, we’ve always had amazing vocalists that appeared on the mic with us. People like Macy Gray, Esthero, Debi Nova, Fergie. On Elephunk, there were several females that appeared on that album. Obviously Fergie was the featured female, but on songs like Lets Get it Started, it’s Noelle (Scaggs), and then Fergie, songs like Latin Girls, it’s Debi Nova, and Request Line, it’s Macy Gray. We’ll always work with good females.”  That’s true, yes, but we can’t help but feel that will.i.am is just dumping Fergie Ferg into a group of female artists the band has worked with in the past. For 15 years Fergie has played an enormous role as frontwoman, and her vocals are strongly featured on the majority of the band’s biggest hits.  So is Fergie being replaced? No, according to will.i.am. “As for replacing, what people know The Black Eyed Peas to be, nobody is replacing Fergie,” he told us. “She’s working on her solo project at the moment, we’re on this brand-new experience, celebrating 20 years of Black Eyed Peas putting out music. We worked on a bunch of songs on her solo record, we’re proud that she has her label, but Black Eyed Peas are pushing it forward in terms of content, technology and experiences on our new project, Masters of the Sun.”  It was reported that none other than Nicole Scherzinger would be replacing Fergie, which quite honestly, we wouldn’t mind at all. Although that’s not on the cards, she is somehow involved. “Nicole is on the new BEP project as well,” said will.i.am. “I don’t want to go into details how she’s involved yet,” he added.  We’re sad Fergie won’t be belting out hits like Where is the Love, Boom Boom Pow and I Gotta Feeling, but we look forward to seeing what the boys (AND Nicole Scherzinger) have up their sleeves.  For the full interview, don’t miss next week’s issue of Ahlan!"
0,"If Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, and their daughter Luna aren’t major #FamilyGoals for you, I don’t know what to tell ya. At least from what we get to see on social media and when the two are out in public, Chrissy and John look like they have a beautiful relationship and make a very happy family. I mean, when John tried to break up with her because he was too “stressed,” Chrissy had a very simple response: “No.” What an inspiration. Their one-year-old daughter Luna definitely benefits from the couple’s strong bond, but apparently she’s also already learned a thing or two about making fun of her dad from her sarcastic mom.  In a new interview with E! News, Legend admitted that Luna is already making fun of him for his bad eyesight in the most adorable way, and, of course, with the support of her mom... and the entire planet population, probably.  ""Chrissy has her doing this thing called 'Daddy Eyes,'"" Legend explained. ""[It started] because one day, I didn't have my contacts on, and I was squinting around the house. Luna started mocking my eyes. So Chrissy started calling it 'Daddy Eyes.'""  Chrissy has actually captured Luna’s adorable “Daddy Eyes” impression on her Snapchat before, and it's as adorable as you might have imagined.  ""Luna has me cracking up all the time,"" Legend said, and, well, same. Just take a look as she watches her dad appear on Sesame Street for the very first time.  When John first posted this video to instagram, Luna had no idea what Sesame Street was. She was sick and couldn't go to set when John was filming so all the characters made this video for her. This is her first time watching it and knowing how freaking epic it is A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Aug 9, 2017 at 5:15pm PDT  Legend also spoke to E! News about how Luna is growing up. Luna and Chrissy have joined Legend on the European leg of his current tour, and according to him, it's been a great experience so far, especially for the little one.  ""I love having them with me,"" he said. ""I've seen Luna grow up during the tour... She's really starting to walk now and really starting to talk a bit more now, too. A lot of that's happened while we were on the road. She's been on her first tour bus ride. She's been to her first concert. It's really a lot of fun having her experience a lot of firsts during this."""

0,"a:  Always follow the instructions on the label for cleaning your house shoes. That’s the best starting point. But if you lack those instructions for some reason, the good news is that the majority of the house shoes on our list are machine washable.  Wash on a gentle cycle with warm water so they keep their shape. If you want to dry them in the dryer, make sure you use a low setting. Or, to be safe, you can let them air dry. If you’re afraid of what the washing machine might do to your house shoes, you can always hand wash them.  Just fill your sink with warm, soapy water (you can use laundry detergent in place of soap if you prefer—read the detergent label for the correct amount to use) and use your fingers or a cloth to gently agitate and scrub your slippers. Then let them soak for 10 minutes or so.  After they’ve soaked, drain the sink and rinse the slippers off with warm water, squeezing as much water out as you can when you’re done. If you want, you can refill your sink with clean water and let them soak again. After you’ve squeezed out all the excess water, either by hand or with a towel, you can let them air dry or dry them in the dryer on a low setting.  NOTE: Only use one of these cleaning methods if your shoes are made from a washable material like cotton or nylon! Other materials, like suede or leather, will need to be wiped off, not washed off, so make sure you’re only using the above methods if your shoes can be submerged in water."
0,"NBC’s new sitcom “Great News” is something of a family affair.  The Tina Fey-produced workplace comedy centers on Katie Wendelson (Briga Heelan), a 30-year-old producer at New Jersey-based cable news show “The Breakdown,” whose overly involved mother, Carol (Andrea Martin), decides to take an internship at her daughter’s office.  Its central mother-daughter story is based on creator Tracey Wigfield’s close relationship with her own mother, Kathy, who lives in Wayne, NJ, and whom she calls every day. While Kathy never went so far as to intern at one of her daughter’s previous gigs as a writer on “30 Rock” and “The Mindy Project,” Wigfield, 33, says, “Her personality is very much Carol on the show. She’s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.”  That specific boundary-crossing act appears in the two-episode premiere (Tuesday at 9 p.m. on NBC), as do other real-life examples — helped by the fact that Wigfield’s younger sister, Ashley, is also a writer on the show. Heelan (“Ground Floor”) plays a slightly younger version of Wigfield, who’s torn between still needing her mother and not wanting to need her — a role that felt especially relevant to the actress, who is a new mom to a weeks-old daughter with husband Rene Gube.  “[That] was kind of amazing, knowing that I was having a girl when we were filming a mother-daughter show,” says Heelan, 30. “Before this child popped out of me, [I thought] yes, I would never be overbearing like that and I’m not gonna scare her with horrible dramatic things that could happen to her and constantly be hovering or trying to control who she dates. But then when I look at her face now, I’m like, ‘Girl, I can’t promise you I’m not gonna do any of that crazy stuff.’  “I have a lot more compassion for mothers everywhere.”  ‘Her personality is very much Carol on the show. She’s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.’ - Tracey Wigfield on her mother's similarity to 'Great News' character  In “Great News,” the confidence-challenged Katie soon warms up to the idea of her cheerleader-in-chief mother being around the office, not least because of Carol’s unfiltered way of talking to her superiors. Though Heelan first met her TV mom Martin at their first rehearsal, she also immediately wanted to be around the Broadway legend all the time.  “As the daughter, if your mom’s in the room, you feel grounded, you feel comforted by that person and we instantly had that,” she says. “Even in social situations, when we weren’t working, if she’s there, I want to be next to her. I had so much to learn from her, too. As an actor, it was like Christmas.”  The ensemble cast is rounded out by “Saturday Night Live” alum Horatio Sanz as the staff video editor, Adam Campbell as the executive producer, Wigfield as the channel’s nerdy meteorologist, John Michael Higgins as “The Breakdown”s blowhard co-anchor and Nicole Richie (yes, of “The Simple Life” fame) as the hip co-host he’s perpetually butting heads with.  “[Nicole] came in and auditioned … and she nailed it,” Wigfield says. “I always thought she was really funny on ‘The Simple Life’ but she obviously hasn’t done a ton of scripted acting. I was so pleasantly surprised that she was really good and very precise and had great timing. I’m excited for people to see her.”  “Great News” Series premiere 9 p.m. Tuesday on NBC"

The Maroon 5 frontman and ""Voice"" coach has opened up about the baby on the way and revealed whether 1-year-old daughter Dusty Rose will soon have a little brother or sister.  ""It's a girl,"" he told Ellen DeGeneres Tuesday. ""We're having another girl!""  The proud father was happy to share the news with the host and happy to get some help from her — again.  When Prinsloo was pregnant with their first daughter, it was DeGeneres who came up with the baby's name.  ""So obviously now, whether you like it or not, you're going to be involved with this next one, too,"" Levine told her.  She liked that just fine, and when she tried to confirm it, he promised it would at least be ""a collaborative effort."" DeGeneres really wanted to lock that down because naming two of kids would make for a ""big story.""  ""Maybe three?"" Levine countered.  That wasn't a twin tease, but rather a hint at want could be to come.  ""I want a lot,"" he said of their future brood. ""I thrive in chaos. I really genuinely enjoy it.""  And Prinsloo is on board with a big family, too — maybe even bigger than he envisions.  ""She wants like 100 babies, but I don't know if I can do that,"" he admitted."

0,"Dolly Parton on Creating Tunes for 'Dumplin'': ""I Was Playing Off a Lot of My Own Emotions""  The country legend talks penning not one but six songs for the Netflix comedy, reveals plans for her upcoming anthology series for the streamer and dishes on the status of the '9 to 5' sequel.  It's downright odd that it took until 2018 for someone to make a rom-com revolving around Dolly Parton's unmatched catalog of empowerment bops, but here we are and here Dumplin' is.  Based on the 2015 YA novel by Texas-based author Julie Murphy, Dumplin', which bowed on Netflix on Dec. 7, tells the story of Willowdean Dickson, the overweight daughter of a former pageant winner slash current pageant host, who signs up for her mom's Miss Teen Blue Bonnet pageant as a tribute to her late Aunt Lucy, whose intense Dolly fandom Will-for-short inherited. Lucy's attendant supreme self-confidence (having taken the gospels of Dolly to heart), however, has proved harder to absorb.  The film, starring Jennifer Aniston and Patti Cake$ breakout Danielle Macdonald, features big hair, cute boys, dance numbers and a whole host of other hooks to hang a Parton needle drop on.  While reaching out to Parton to ask for the rights to standards like ""Two Doors Down"" and ""Jolene"" (rights without which there wouldn't be much of a film), Aniston — who also exec produced via her banner Echo Films — and director Anne Fletcher asked Parton if she would write a theme song. And by the way, would she work with composer/producer Linda Perry? ""They just kept flinging stuff at me and I just kept saying 'Sure!' And I didn’t know Linda, actually, so I was just being a good sport,"" Parton says. However, when Parton and Perry met, they ""clicked like you wouldn't believe.""  Tasked with writing a song, the duo wrote five — ""Girl in the Movies"" (nominated for a Golden Globe), ""Red Shoes,"" ""Who,"" ""Push and Pull"" and ""If We Don't"" — and Parton wrote a sixth, ""Why.""  The soundtrack is filled out with Perry-produced re-recordings of Parton hits, several featuring collaborators like Sia (""Here I Am"") and Miranda Lambert (""Dumb Blonde""). On Nov. 30, the morning of the album's release, Parton, 72, spoke with THR about her partnership with Perry; why the song the filmmakers chose as the theme, ""Girl in the Movies,"" is getting the biggest awards push; and convincing Aniston to sing backup.  Were you surprised when the producers contacted you about this project and about collaborating with Linda?  I didn’t know Linda, actually, so I was just being a good sport and was just flattered and honored that there was a movie being made that was paying some kind of homage to me. I got with Linda and we just clicked like you wouldn't believe. I was very surprised because I don’t write with people. I’m very picky about that. I've written with very few people in my whole lifetime. We started writing and working on what we thought would be the theme song, but we were so inspired we just kept just writing and writing and writing songs they hadn’t even asked for! So then we thought, ""Well we'll just save that for another album."" But [Anne and Jennifer] kept hearing the songs and they thought, ""Well we can weave these in and out of the movie, and we can actually make these part of the soundtrack."" So it just really came from two very strong women that love to write and love to create things, so it’s been a wonderful partnership.  When you and Linda got together, was ""Girl in the Movies"" the first song you wrote?  Actually, I don't think that was the first one. I told [Linda], ""Let's go see the movie before we start to write anything,"" because I have to see and feel these characters; I have to know their stories. I [had read] the book, but that's different when you see it onscreen. Jennifer Aniston took Linda and me to see a rough cut of it. I got to know all the characters — the attitudes, the emotions, the feelings of all the people. That's when we started to write the different songs for it. I wrote the lyrics mostly. Linda's very strong with music and I'm good with words and feelings, so it was a very good collaboration. It was all based on what I felt the movie was about.  At some point, Miley Cyrus was going to sing ""Girl in the Movies"" or duet with you?  I had hoped Miley could sing with me, and we actually did a cut of it, but we thought that this movie was coming out last year. Miley had a little bit of time and was kind of in between projects and so was I. But it kept lagging and lagging, so Miley had to start on her own projects; she was doing a new record and getting ready for her new tour. In defense of her, she did try and she did give us permission [to release the cut], but after a time we couldn't put it out as a single and it turned out that this was the [song] they wanted to use as the theme song, so we just had to take Miley off. But she will at some point record it, and I'm going to sing with her on her version.  When you write six songs, how do you decide which one to focus on for the Oscar campaign?  The record label has a lot to do with it. I know everyone just seemed to take to ""Girl in the Movies"" because it is about a girl in the movies and [the song] is in the movie. That particular song was more of a team effort. I really enjoyed it, but I never know which one of my songs is great — they're like my kids; I love 'em all. Some of them might be prettier in other people's eyes, but they're all beautiful to you. So that was more of a business-ended decision on which [song] should be first, what they thought would be the best contender for an Oscar. Now that we are talking about it, ""Red Shoes"" is one of my personal favorites.  I really like ""Push and Pull."" It seems like it's the most thematically linked to the movie, in my mind. It also struck me as the most classic ""Dolly"" song.  There's a lot of truth in that, and actually, when I saw the movie I saw the relationship with the mother and the daughter, and they were both trying to push and pull. And I also have a sister and one of her daughters, and they’re always kinda like that too; they're always pushing and pulling and they fight and they fuss and they get back together. The reason it sounded like a Dolly song is I was playing off a lot of my own emotions and family feelings — and of course everybody has that in their family: mothers and daughters and fathers and sons, they collide when the kids start getting old enough to have a mind of their own. Anyhow, that is where I came up with ""Push and Pull."" Not only that but I got Danielle and Jennifer to come over and sing on it. The said, ""Oh no, we don't sing!"" and I said ""You do now! I had them both come over, Linda and I, and we worked with them. They were so nervous, but they did good! And they're on there, credited.  I also wanted to ask about ""Jolene"" with the new arrangement. I know you've recorded that song a lot over the years different ways. How did this version come about?  Well actually that was totally Linda’s idea. She loved the song ""Jolene"" and she put on Paul McCartney's version of ""Eleanor Rigby"" and said, ""Wouldn’t it be cool to just do 'Jolene' completely different? Just you and the orchestra?"" I said ""Well, I guess!"" (Laughs.) And so she worked up a string arrangement with the orchestra and she said, ""Well, get out there and sing!"" I went out and it was like a one-take! It was really a magical moment. To hear it slowed down that way with the orchestra it really took it into that Elizabethan sound, like old parlour music. It took on a life of its own, and I am really proud of that. I had never thought of [the song] that way, and I cannot take any credit for it — other than to write it and to sing it. (Laughs.)  Well, you know, just that!  But not for that new arrangement! It's kinda refreshing actually to get to do it differently than I always have.  What can you say about the songs that will be featured in your eight-episode Netflix anthology series?  The series is called Heartstrings, and it's based on songs that I've written. Some of them are famous and some of them are not. They're just the songs that make the best stories. We, of course, did ""Jolene."" Julianne Hough played Jolene, and she killed it. And Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Brad Paisley's wife, played Jolene's best friend. I actually got to star in that one: [My character owns] the bar where Jolene works — she's a singer — so I'm trying to encourage her to get to Nashville and all that. We also did ""Two Doors Down."" We did a song called ""If I Had Wings,"" with Gerald McRaney and Delta Burke. They're married, of course, and have been for many, many years, but it's the first time they've starred together in anything. We did one pet song — I have an old song called ""Cracker Jack."" We have one called ""J.J. Sneed"" — it's a Western. They're all completely different. One of my favorites is called ""These Old Bones."" It's about an old clairvoyant country woman played by Kathleen Turner. I narrate all the shows at the front and talk about how the song came to be, and my music plays in and out — sometimes more than one song in each show.  I have to ask if you did an episode based on one of my personal favorites, ""Wildflowers""?  Well, you know what? I will. Because I'm like you: I think ""Wildflowers"" would make a wonderful one. It's kind of like my story. That's so much like ""The Dolly Parton Story"" that I'm going to make them pay me more money for that one! (Laughs.) But I will be doing ones like ""My Blue Ridge Mountain Boy"" about the country girl that goes to New Orleans, becomes a prostitute and thinks she's going to make it big in the world and then realizes she misses that boy she left behind. If they continue with it — because they seem to like what we're doing so far — after these eight shows, which they plan to drop next fall worldwide, we'll see how it goes.  What's that status of the 9 to 5 sequel, which is set up at Fox with Rashida Jones and Pat Resnick writing the script?  Actually, we are supposed to have the first scripts in our hands within days. Of course, we will have to see what our thoughts are, and it will have to be rewritten a time or two, I'm sure. Hopefully, we might get a chance to start that in the new year. But it's going to really be good — after all these years, they finally came up with something that makes sense and was worthwhile to do. [The new plot focuses on] three younger women working at the same Consolidated Companies, and these three girls try to figure out who these women were who made all these changes years ago. They find us, and I am sure it will have a lot of comedy and cover some issues that still need to be touched on, but in a fun, new way. Talking about 9 to 5, they did a 9 to 5 [movie,] then they did a 9 to 5 series, which actually stars one of my sisters, Rachel. Then I had the chance to write the musical 9 to 5 for Broadway, and now they are actually opening that again in London in January. I've written another song or two for that. I'm very proud that 9 to 5 just keeps paying off. It is the song and the movie that just will not die!

0,"Caitlyn Jenner memoir’s version of life with Kris Jenner creates a new rift in the family  (Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty Images)  As Caitlyn Jenner’s just-published memoir “The Secrets of My Life” pulls back the curtain on her gender transition and her life among the Kardashians, not everybody is taking it well.  Especially not Kris Jenner.  Details about the Olympian-turned-reality-star’s decision to transition in 2015 from Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner and confirmation that she had her final gender reassignment surgery are all in the book, but some dishy material about the Kardashian matriarch is reverberating with fans and upsetting the reigning first family of reality TV.  The memoir, co-written by Buzz Bissinger, who penned the Vanity Fair article that introduced Caitlyn Jenner to the masses, has some kind words for the momager, including admiration for Kris’ connections, her business acumen and her ability to perfectly apply lip liner without a mirror.  However, Caitlyn also said in the book that she told Kris about her gender issues before they got married and said Kris knew that for 4½ years before they met, Caitlyn had been on hormones. Additionally, Caitlyn wrote that she told Kris about her gender problems before they would make love.  “I told her there had been a woman inside me all my life,” she wrote.  The couple announced their split in 2013 and finalized their divorce in 2014. During their decades-long union, Caitlyn cross-dressed in front of her ex but was asked by Kris to do it only while traveling, so that their children wouldn’t get wind of it. It was something Caitlyn grew to resent, she said, and she would steal her wife’s gowns and purses to wear while traveling. (Their differing takes on their marital woes have been a topic of discussion for years.)  In a recent episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” Kris fumed with anger about passages in “The Secrets of My Life” that claimed she knew Caitlyn was transgender before they wed.  “None of it makes sense,”Kris said to daughters Khloe and Kim Kardashian. “I read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time. ... Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?”  She added: “I’ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life.”  In response, the Olympic gold medalist said on “Good Morning America” that the book is “extraordinarily honest.”  “It is my perspective, and obviously when you do a book like that, there are different opinions. I have a lot of friends that know the truth and know what I’ve been through and know the whole situation,” Caitlyn said.  She told Andy Cohen that in the wake of publishing, Kris said she didn’t want to talk to Caitlyn ever again. (Caitlyn also elaborated on her claims that she was a “punching bag” on the show and a revelation that Kris had been in charge of her finances.)  “Honestly, I never had a low point [while doing the show], actually, until the other day when Kris said some of that stuff. It was the first time I was really upset,” she said. “I had some of the best conversations with my children on that show. ... It forces you to deal with issues. ... It forces you to sit down with your kids and deal with a lot of things.”  Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner’s second-born child with the late Robert Kardashian, shared her thoughts on the feud on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in an episode that aired Thursday.  “My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she’s saying all these things,” Kardashian said. “I just don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair. Things aren’t truthful.”  Kardashian said Caitlyn was dishonest “with certain things” about Kris in the book.  “I feel like it’s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it’s just so hurtful,” she said. “I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.”  Kardashian said she and husband Kanye West have been avid supporters of Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and wanted to remain respectful of her, but thought there was no need to “bash” the family. She said she was hurt by her stepfather, who’s dad to her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and hasn’t spoken to Caitlyn in a few weeks.  “Kendall and Kylie, that’s their dad and I think my mom’s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,” Kardashian said. But that doesn’t appear to be the case for the rest of the Kardashian brood.  “I’ll always love her. That was my stepdad for so many years. She taught me about character and so much growing up and I just feel like I don’t respect the character that she’s showing now.”  Kim Kardashian’s younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, is also “taking it a little tough,” Caitlyn said at a book signing, according to RadarOnline. “Everyone on the Jenner side is fine. All this stuff tends to work itself out!”  Someone call Ryan Murphy, because this needs to be turned into a “Feud” series, stat.  ------------  FOR THE RECORD  April 27, 3:31 p.m.: An earlier version of this article said Bruce Jenner and Kris Jenner finalized their divorce in 2013. They divorced in 2014.  ------------"

And it looks like there could be sparks again as they were seen together at the Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival in Indio, California, for a second time on Sunday.

The model was able to get a great view of the main stage in the front row with Tommy Lee  A long history: Carmen dated Tommy in 1999 and she stayed friends with him. Here she is seen with husband Dave Navarro, Tommy and his wife Pamela Anderson in 2005  And Carmen seems to have had a similar career to Pamela's. Both posed nude for Playboy and both appeared on the hit TV series Baywatch.  Tommy's fiance German-Greek Sofia Toufa, 33, didn't appear to be at Coachella where Carmen and the rocker enjoyed each other's company also on Saturday.

The Baywatch actress showed off her curves in a see-through dress  Meanwhile Carmen's last high profile relationship was when she ended a two-month romance with Simon Cowell in February 2013.  However, she has been a muse to many musicians, including late singer Prince and her ex husband Dave Navarro, whom she divorced in 2007 after four years of marriage.  Spilling out! The blonde's top struggled to contain her chest  On Sunday Carmen wore a black bikini top teamed with an embroidered dress that left plenty of her cleavage and more flesh on show.  The embroidered maxi dress had an ornate construction that incorporated cut-outs from top to bottom.  Under the see-through garment she had on a high-waisted bikini brief with a matching string bikini top that left little to the imagination.  Easter treat! Carmen wished her admirers a happy Easter holiday in the caption of an alluring photo  A lot of heart! The entertainer snapped a photo of her hair accessories  'Happy Easter from Coachella,' she captioned an alluring photo of the dress that highlighted her legs and bikini brief.  Black lace-up boots and a choker completed the outfit.  Her blonde hair was styled loose and included pink and purple hair pieces that were incorporated into a few dreadlocks. The entertainer shared a photo one day earlier on Instagram of some 'Heart shaped dreads' that she was keen on showing off at Coachella.  She continued the edgy look with dramatic eyeliner, a splash of glossy pink lipstick and a nose ring."

After setting up a giant inflatable slide at her Rhode Island home, and inviting half of showbiz land along, the star appeared to get a professional photographer on hand to document the entire thing.  And the snaps have caused a very mixed reaction from fans, as they share their theories over the event online.  It's fair to say anyone would want some happy photos to look back on following such a huge bash, but some fans have blasted the singer for throwing a ""fake"" party - while others rushed to defend her, shutting down the many theories floating around online.  (Image: Instagram)  One wrote: ""OK but like isnt it a lil embarrassing that taylor swift had professional photographers @ her 4th party? or? is everyone's whole life fake?""  Another added: ""Taylor Swift 4th of July party makes me it looks too fake and too planed...""  And one wrote: ""Maybe someday I'll get lucky and get invited to Taylor Swift's fake Fourth of July party.""  While one added: ""so did Taylor Swift have a photographer at her fourth of July party.""  Meanwhile some even hit out at her famous friends, with one writing: ""I feel like Taylor's squad is fake and Only shows up on holidays like tomrrow lol.""  But the claims were met with anger from some solid Taylor fans, as one wrote: ""Taylor's squad is not fake. She makes & keeps friends!""  And one added: ""I think my goal in life is to one day be invited to one of Taylor Swift's July fourth parties.""  We have contacted Taylor's reps for comment.  The Shake It Off beauty is known for her extravagant Independence Day celebrations and this year Taymerica was no different.  With the likes of Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively and Ruby Rose gathering at her lavish home it's no surprise she pulled out all the stops.  Sharing snaps from the weekend to Instagram, Taylor and her pals could be seen decked out in patriotic swimwear as they rode the giant wild water slide in her garden.  (Image: Instagram)  (Image: Instagram)  Swift even rocked rocked a matching stripped swimsuit to BGG Gigi - a sure sign of friendship.  The star celebrated the holiday with a huge group shot, which showed the likes of Blake Lively, Uzo Aduba, Gigi Hadid, Rachel Platten, Este Haim, Halston Sage, Cara Delevingne, Ruby Rose and Harley Gusman lining up together.  All the ladies were decked out in matching patriotic outfits as a firework lit up the sky behind them.  ""Happy 4th from us,"" she wrote along with a heart emoji.  But where was Tom?  The couple have been enjoying a VERY public romance over the last few weeks kissing and flirting in the US, the UK and Rome before heading back to Rhode Island.  The 35-year-old didn't make the cut in terms of her Instagram page though, which has so far remained Tom-less.  Perhaps Taylor is eager to avoid comparisons with her celebrations last year when Calvin Harris was the man on her arm.  Back then she posted a snap, which she deleted after their break-up last month, of him giving her a piggy back ride.  Read more:Looks familiar!

0,"American actor  Nathan Karl Kress (born November 18, 1992) is an American actor, director, and former child model. Kress has been acting since the age of four and played the role of Freddie Benson on the Nickelodeon series iCarly and as the voice of Wedge Antilles in the Disney XD animated series, Star Wars Rebels.  Early life [ edit ]  Kress was born on November 18, 1992 in Glendale, California.[1][2] He has two brothers, Andrew and Kevin, neither of whom are involved in show business.[3][4] Kress began his professional career at the age of four when he displayed a natural talent for memorizing and re-enacting the shows he saw on television, prompting his mother to take him to an open ""cattle call"" showcase where he was quickly signed with a talent agent.[3][4][5] Over the next three years, Kress modeled for various print advertisements, as well as performing in numerous commercials and voice-over roles; the most notable of which was his dual role as the voices of ""Easy"" and ""Tough Pup"" in the 1998 feature film Babe: Pig in the City.[2][4][5][6][7] At the age of six, he decided to take a break from acting and return to regular school, where he led a relatively ""normal"" life for the next five years until deciding to return to acting professionally at the age of eleven.[4][5][6]  Career [ edit ]  At the age of 11, Kress was cast in the lead role as ""The Emperor"" in a school production of The Emperor's New Clothes.[4] The role rekindled his interest in performing, and at the end of his fifth grade school year, he asked his parents if he could be home-schooled so he could return to acting.[4][6] A mutual friend of Kress from school put him in touch with an agent, and after attending a summer acting ""boot camp"", Kress was soon going on real professional auditions once again.[4][5][6]  In April 2005, Kress made his first live television appearance since returning to acting in a comedy sketch on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he played a young Simon Cowell of American Idol, and would continue to appear in various comedy sketches on the show a total of 5 times over the next year.[2][8] Kress continued to land steady work over the next two years, appearing in guest-starring roles on dramatic series such as House, Standoff, and Without a Trace as well as the Disney Channel comedy series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[2][3][8][9] Kress also appeared in several short films including Pickled, Magnus, Inc., and Bag, for which he was awarded a 168 Film Festival Jury Award for his portrayal of a small-fry drug dealer with a conscience.[4][8][10] In addition to live-action roles, Kress continued to work as a voice-actor, lending his voice to various characters in the animated feature film Chicken Little and on the Nickelodeon animated series Shuriken School.[8]  In February 2006, Kress landed a small role on the popular Nickelodeon family series Drake & Josh.[2][3][4][5][11] He played the role of Toplin, a ""geeky"" kid at a birthday party with a crush on Drake and Josh's younger sister Megan Parker (played by Miranda Cosgrove) in the episode Battle of Panthatar.[3][5][8] Kress did not know it at the time, but this small role would lead to an opportunity that would catapult him to stardom.[3][4][5][12] While filming his scenes for Drake & Josh, television show creator and executive producer Dan Schneider took an interest in him and called him over to talk with him and to introduce him to some network executives.[2][4][5] At the time, Schneider was developing a new series for Nickelodeon, and was on the lookout for someone to play one of the lead roles in the untitled project, which would later become known as iCarly.[4][5][11]  The role of Toplin was similar to a character named Freddie that Schneider was looking to cast on iCarly.[3][4][5] Schneider had been so impressed with Kress' performance that he remembered him, and about 6 months after filming his small role on Drake & Josh, Kress was called in to audition for the role of ""Freddie"" shortly after his fourteenth birthday.[3][4][5] After several rounds of auditions, Kress was invited back for a screen test with Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy and a couple of days later he was notified that he had landed the role of ""Freddie"".[4][5][11] Although iCarly would not premiere until the fall of 2007, the decision was made to cut Kress' scenes with Miranda Cosgrove out of the Drake & Josh episode that had started it all, in order to avoid any potential confusion among the young Nickelodeon viewing audience.[3][5]  On September 8, 2007, iCarly debuted on Nickelodeon and quickly became a fan favorite.[13][14] On the show, Kress plays Fredward ""Freddie"" Benson, the technical producer for the fictional web-show iCarly, which stars his character's two best friends, Carly Shay (Cosgrove) and Samantha ""Sam"" Puckett (McCurdy).[4][5][15] His character has a crush on the main character Carly, and a feuding, bitter-sweet, love/hate relationship with Carly's best friend and web-show co-star, Sam.[4][5][12] The show became Nickelodeon's most-watched show aimed at tweens, and catapulted Kress to international fame among adolescents.[2][5][12][16][17][18] Kress' performance on the show has been characterized by one reviewer for Variety as ""sweetly nerdy"".[13]  In 2008, Kress starred in the Nickelodeon television movie Gym Teacher: The Movie.[1][4][8][17] In the movie, Kress played ""Roland"", a decidedly uncoordinated student who transfers to a new school and must be whipped into shape by his ambitious gym teacher, Dave Stewie (Christopher Meloni).[1][4][17] Later that same year, he starred as Freddie Benson in the television movie iCarly: iGo to Japan, Nickelodeon's first television film adaptation of iCarly television series.[11][16][19] Throughout 2009, Kress continued to play the role of Freddie on iCarly, but was unable to take on other projects due to Nickelodeon's decision to film both seasons two and three of the show back-to-back without the usual hiatus between filming seasons, in order to make up for the time lost during the 2008 writers strike.[5][11][12][20]  In March 2010, Kress guest-starred in the CBS television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in season 10: episode 15 titled ""Neverland"".[2][8][9][21] Kress played Mason Ward, one of two best friends of a fourteen-year-old victim with traces of blood of an inmate under his fingernails.[21] Kress told Fanlala.com of his CSI role ""It was a great opportunity to try my hand at something different. I had done scenes in dramas in the past, but other than a few semi-serious scenes on iCarly, it had been a long time since I've had the opportunity to do anything other than comedy.""[21] Later that same year, Kress returned to comedic roles, guest-starring as Prince Gabriel on the Nickelodeon comedy series True Jackson, VP, and as the voice of Ronald on the Nickelodeon animated series The Penguins of Madagascar.[8]  Kress in 2011  In 2011, Kress continued to appear in the role of Freddie Benson on the fourth season of iCarly, and in January 2011, Miranda Cosgrove began telling news sources that she was looking forward to returning to Hollywood to begin filming the fifth season of the main character of the Nickelodeon show.[22][23][24] On January 27, 2011 Cosgrove told Cleveland Live News ""We're getting ready to start the next season, right after the (Dancing Crazy) tour. I would be willing to do the show as long as people like it and as long as it works.""[22] On January 29, 2011, Reuters also reported that Cosgrove was preparing to begin filming season 5,[23] and on February 3, 2011 Cosgrove told The Middletown Press, when speaking of the show and her co-stars, Kress and Jennette McCurdy: ""I've known them since I was little. I can't wait to get back. I'm really comfortable doing [iCarly]. It's like my home away from home.""[24] The show was later renewed for a sixth and final season, with the series finale ""iGoodbye"" airing on November 23, 2012. Kress would eventually reprise the role of Freddie Benson in one episode of the show's spin-off series Sam & Cat which aired in January 2014.  In 2014, Kress co-starred in his first major film, Into the Storm, and had a major role in the web show Video Game High School as ""The New Law"".  In 2015, he debuted as a director on Henry Danger.[25]  In 2019, Kress started a podcast called RadioActive Dads with Brett Davern.  Personal life [ edit ]  As of February 2011 , Kress was finishing his senior year of high school and hoped to attend UCLA, his father's alma mater.[3][12] While filming iCarly, Kress was tutored on the set with his co-stars Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy, and was home-schooled on the weekends or when on hiatus from the shooting of the show.[4][5]  Kress is a devout evangelical Christian and has said that he feels a responsibility to be a role model for younger fans.[4][5][11]  On May 29, 2015, Kress became engaged to his girlfriend, actress, stunt performer, and Into the Storm castmate London Elise Moore.[26] They married on November 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.[27] Their first child, a girl, was born on December 21, 2017.[28] On October 21, 2020, Kress announced that he is expecting his second child with his wife.[29] On March 22, 2021, Kress announced the birth of his second daughter.[30]  Philanthropy [ edit ]  Kress works with various charitable causes including The Big Green Help, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and The Starlight Children's Foundation.[2][31][32][33] In the summer of 2003, before returning to his acting career, Kress and his family traveled to Lithuania with the Christian missionary organization, YWAM (Youth With A Mission), where he has given money to help people build houses for the poor.[4]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Video games [ edit ]  Web series [ edit ]  Year Title Role Notes 2014 Video Game High School New Law/The Law Starting in S3E3  As a director [ edit ]  Year Title Notes 2015–2019 Henry Danger TV series, 11 episodes 2016–2019 Game Shakers TV series, 6 episodes  Awards and nominations [ edit ]"
0,"Wikimedia list article  Neymar , currently the most expensive footballer  The following is a list of most expensive association football transfers, which details the highest transfer fees ever paid for players, as well as transfers which set new world transfer records. The first recorded record transfer was of Willie Groves from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa for £100 in 1893[1] (equivalent to £11,000 today). This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by the Football Association in 1885.[2] The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for €222 million (£198 million) in August 2017.[3][4][5][6]  Most of the transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from England, France, Italy and Spain.  Three players appear on the list twice: Romelu Lukaku, Ángel Di María and Cristiano Ronaldo. All of the players on the list are of European (UEFA), South American (CONMEBOL), North America (CONCACAF) and African (CAF) origin. Following the transfer of American Christian Pulisic of the CONCACAF confederation in 2019, there are currently no players on the list from the remaining regions; Asia (AFC) and Oceania (OFC).  As of 4 September 2020  Fee broke the world football transfer record at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for a teenager at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the national league record at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for a Fee broke the record for a South American player at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for an Fee broke the record for an African player at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for a Fee broke the record for a North American player at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for a goalkeeper at the time of the transfer  Fee broke the record for a defender at the time of the transfer  Notes  The first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over £100 was Scottish striker Willie Groves when he together with Jack Reynolds (£50) made the switch from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in 1893,[2] eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just another twelve years for the figure to become £1000, when Sunderland striker Alf Common moved to Middlesbrough.[86][87]  It was not until 1928 that the first five-figure transfer took place. David Jack of Bolton Wanderers was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman got the Bolton representatives drunk.[88][89] Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid £10,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for £13,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed Burnley's Bob Kelly a fee of for £6,500.[87]  The first player from outside Great Britain to break the record was Bernabé Ferreyra, a player known as La Fiera for his powerful shot. His 1932 transfer from Tigre to River Plate cost £23k,[89] and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of Johnny Morris to Derby County for £24k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when Luis Suárez Miramontes was sold by FC Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than £100k.[87]  In 1968, Pietro Anastasi became the first £500k player when Juventus purchased him from Varese,[89] which was followed seven years later with Giuseppe Savoldi becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from Bologna to Napoli.[87][89]  After Alf Common and David Jack, the third player to twice be transferred for world record fees is Diego Maradona.[87][89] His transfers from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for £3m, and then to Napoli for £5m, both broke the record in 1982 and 1984 respectively. The most recent is Ronaldo with his record-breaking move from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona in 1996 for £13.2m, although Alan Shearer's transfer to Newcastle broke the record the same summer. A year later Inter Milan paid £19.5m for Ronaldo and again he became the player with the highest transfer fee.  In the space of 61 days in 1992,[89] three transfers broke the record,[87] all by Italian clubs: Jean-Pierre Papin transferred from Marseille to A.C. Milan, becoming the first ever £10m player.[89] Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of Gianluca Vialli for a fee of £12m from Sampdoria. Milan then completed the signing of Gianluigi Lentini for a fee of £13m which stood as the record for three years.  The 1996 transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of £15m,[91] kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: Ronaldo moved the following year to Inter Milan from FC Barcelona for a fee of £17m,[92] which was followed in 1998 by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman Denílson from São Paulo to Real Betis for a fee of approximately £21m.[87][89][93]  In 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter Milan for £28m,[94] while Hernán Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than £30m.[87][95] The transfer prompted the BBC to ask ""has the world gone mad""?[96] It took two weeks for the record to be broken when Luís Figo made a controversial £37m move from Barcelona to rivals Real Madrid.[87][97] A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of Zinedine Zidane for £48 million (150 billion lire).[98]  Zidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the Galácticos policy by buying Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£56 million),[99] which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broke by Real themselves when signing Cristiano Ronaldo for £80m (€94m) from Manchester United in the same transfer window,[87][100] 4 years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost €91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around €100 million (around £85.1 million).[101][102] Documents leaked in 2016 by Football Leaks revealed that installments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of €100,759,418.[87][103] In 2016, Manchester United eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder Paul Pogba for €105 million (£89 million),[104] four years after having released him to Juventus for training compensation.  A year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee. Paris St. Germain matched the €222 million buyout fee of Barcelona's Neymar, converted to a reported £198 million[5][6] or £200 million[3][7] by different sources, more than double the previous record. This was the first time that the record fee was paid by a French club.  Historical progression [ edit ]  Comparison of fees in different nations is complicated by varying exchange rates.

0,"Are they back on? This video makes it seem that way. This weekend, Chloë Grace Moretz posted a video of Brooklyn Beckham giving her a pretty long kiss on the cheek. That might seem somewhat innocent, but if you think about their backstory, it could be a very big clue.  Moretz and Beckham first sparked interest when they were linked together back in 2016. However, the relationship didn’t last too long — they broke up, and Beckham had a few interviews where he mentioned he was single. But even if they’re nothing but friends these days, it seems like they parted on excellent terms.  But, let’s get real here. While they haven’t openly admitted it, we’re under the impression that it’s more than friendship. The most important thing is that they seem to be incredibly happy.  Rumors sparked that the two had reunited back in August, when they were both spotted out together in New York City.  Just a few days ago, Beckham posted a sweet photo of their matching checkered Vans on Instagram, which is simply sweet.  The video of the kiss looks like it happened in Dublin. Both Beckham and Moretz were in town to check out a rugby match, and Beckham posted this photo celebrating the occasion on Instagram.  While it looks like Moretz took the photo in question, Beckham’s account has a ton of gorgeously shot photos, many which include both of them. It could be because he’s a photographer who just recently released his very first book called What I See."

0,"Celebrity  'She is not going to stay with him and work it out,' says Henry Roque of his daughter Annette Roque after Lauer's embroiled in sexual harassment scandal.  Dec 7, 2017  AceShowbiz - In the wake of his sexual harassment scandal, Matt Lauer and his wife Annette Roque reportedly have removed their wedding rings. Lauer, who was recently fired from NBC's ""Today"", was spotted in Sag Harbor, New York near the couple's properties on Wednesday, December 5. He was noticeably seen without his wedding ring.  Donning a blue knitted top, the 59-year-old TV host was snapped heading out for a breakfast. Former model Roque was also photograpped in the Sag Harbor area on the same day, also without her wedding ring. This marks a huge change as Lauer was still seen wearing the ring two days ago.  Roque's father, Henri, revealed to Daily Mail that things in the pair's marriage turned bad after Lauer was accused of sexually harassing a female employee of ""Today"". Speaking from his apartment near Amsterdam, Henry shared, ""'I have no words for her husband. What he has done is bad. Everybody feels betrayed.""  Henry added, ""She is not going to stay with him and work it out. They are not together trying to work it out.""  ""[Annette] is feeling shocked and she is now having sorrow for her children. Me too. Everybody is feeling quite sad,"" he went on saying. ""There are also the kids, I don't know what she's doing or who they are going to stay with.""  Regarding rumors of Roque fleeing to Netherlands with her three kids, Jack Matthew (16), Romy (14) and Thijs (11), following the scandal, Henry quickly denied the claims. ""'It was all bulls**t stories. She's not in Holland. It's all fake news. It's s**t news. Bulls**t news. She's in America,"" he said.  Another source said the couple is still living under one roof and together, despite rumors saying that the pair have been living separately for the last decade. ""They're taking it day by day right now,"" the source revealed. ""His focus is on his family.""  Lauer was fired from ""Today"" after a female employee met with NBC News' human resource last week. She allegedly accused Lauer of inviting her to his hotel room late at night while covering the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia in 2014."
0,"The backlash against director Quentin Tarantino keeps building.  After being accused by Uma Thurman of coercing her to perform a dangerous driving stunt, which led to a car crash, on the set of “Kill Bill,” the filmmaker is now under fire for defending Roman Polanski in a 2003 Howard Stern interview that has resurfaced online.  Tarantino said Polanski’s 13-year-old victim “wanted to have it and dated the guy.” Polanski was arrested in 1977 for five offenses following the alleged assault, including rape by use of drugs, perversion, sodomy, and lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14. He fled the country after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor.  “He didn’t rape a 13-year-old,” Tarantino said in the unearthed interview when asked by Stern why Hollywood embraces Polanski. “It was statutory rape. That’s not quite the same thing. … He had sex with a minor. That’s not rape. To me, when you use the word ‘rape,’ you’re talking about violent, throwing them down; it’s like one of the most violent crimes in the world. Throwing the word ‘rape’ around is like throwing the word ‘racist’ around. It doesn’t apply to everything that people use it for. He was guilty of having sex with a minor.”  “The Howard Stern Show” co-host Robin Quivers then interrupted the “Django Unchained” director, as she did throughout the interview, to note that the sex wasn’t consensual.  “No, that was not the case at all. She wanted to have it and dated the guy,” he said.  Quivers cut him off again, exclaiming, “She was 13!”  “And by the way, we’re talking about America’s morals, we’re not talking about the morals in Europe and everything,” Tarantino said.  Stern then interjected.  “Wait a minute. If you have sex with a 13-year-old girl and you’re a grown man, you know that that’s wrong,” he said.  Tarantino replied, “Look, she was down with this. … She’s talked about it since, ‘No, he didn’t really do anything to me. It was a technicality for being 13.'”  Stern and Quivers, audibly shocked by his comments, continued to push back.  “Would you ever seduce a 13-year-old with pills and booze?” Stern asked point blank.  “No, no, no. Again, you’re killing him with the pills and booze thing,” the Oscar winner responded.  When Quivers said Polanski could have avoided trouble by staying away from the 13-year-old, Tarantino said, “He likes girls.”  “He likes babies!” Quivers countered.  He later admitted that he would “beat the hell out of him” if the 13-year-old was his own daughter.  “But the situation was not that she was against all this. She was down to party with Roman,” he added.  Audio of the interview was pulled from YouTube on Tuesday due to a copyright claim by Sirius XM.  Tarantino’s rep did not respond to a request for comment."
0,"Emma Stone has been vocal about equal pay in Hollywood before, but in an interview with Out Magazine, the actress revealed that some of her male co-stars took pay cuts to ensure pay equality.  “In my career so far, I’ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them,” she said in an interview with Andrea Riseborough and Billie Jean King. “And that’s something they do for me because they feel it’s what’s right and fair. That’s something that’s also not discussed, necessarily — that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly say, ‘That’s what’s fair.’ If my male co-star, who has a higher quote than me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life.”  Riseborough and Stone star in the upcoming film “Battle of the Sexes,” based on the legendary 1973 tennis match between King and Bobby Riggs (played by Steve Carell). King has been a supporter of women’s equality throughout her career, earning her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In the interview, the three women also discussed how the themes of the film are still relevant today — including the current administration.  Also Read: Donald Trump May 'Cherish Women' But Pays Them a Lot Less  “The parallels in this movie are pretty fascinating,” added Stone. “We began shooting in the spring of 2016, when there was still a lot of hope in the air, and it was very interesting to see this guy–this narcissistic, self-focused, constantly-stirring-the-pot kind of guy–against this incredible, qualified woman, and at the same time me playing Billie Jean, with Steve [Carell] playing Bobby Riggs. Obviously the way this has all panned out has been fascinating and horrifying, and it still feels like we’re in a bad dream, but those parallels make sense to me–the equal-pay issue makes a lot of sense to me. At our best right right now we’re making 80 cents to the dollar.”  “White women,” King chimed in. “If you’re African American or Hispanic it goes down, and then Asian Americans make 90 cents to the dollar.”  Stone added, “It’s not about, ‘Women are this and men are that.’ It is, ‘We are all the same, we are all equal, we all deserve the same respect and the same rights.’ And that’s really what I’ve been so grateful for with male co-stars–when I’ve been in a similar-size role in films, and it’s been multiple people who have been really incredible and said, ‘That’s what I want to do. That’s what’s fair and what’s right.'”  Also Read: Patricia Arquette Blasts Hollywood for Continued Gender Pay Gap  Risenborough revealed that she asked for a raise “six weeks ago, to no avail,” adding that the pay disparity is the worst in the United States. And she explained that her entire life has been watching men stick up for each other while women haven’t been “socialized” in the same way, but rather, are sexualized.  “Women are seriously, highly sexualized. Just look at the ‘Baywatch’ posters,” Risenborough said. “It’s disgusting and degrading, and it’s pulling female emancipation kicking and screaming back 500 years. It is so important to think about what happened before, and there was a lot of strength before. Cleopatra was quite a long time ago, but Hillary didn’t get in. There’s a journey here, and it’s about, as Billie says, uniting.”  Read the entire Out Magazine article here. “Battle of the Sexes” opens Sept. 22."
0,"Actor Sam Rockwell ensured his debut as host on “Saturday Night Live” was memorable by letting loose with an accidental and unexpected “f-bomb” – the first time such an incident has occurred since NBC began airing the program live across the nation , putting it on in primetime in some parts of the country.  Viewers in New York heard the epithet clearly in the first half hour of the January 13th broadcast, during a sketch in which Rockwell played a science teacher on a spoof of a PBS kids program. Cast members Cecily Strong and Mikey Day seemed surprised, but kept the action going. Some people watching the show in Los Angeles and Las Vegas reported on Twitter that NBC bleeped out the profanity, and Rick Ludwin, a former longtime head of NBC’s late-night programming, said on the social-media outlet that the network delays its west coast feed by a few seconds. NBC has broadcast “SNL” live across the nation since mid-Spring.  An “SNL” spokeswoman said producers declined to comment on the incident.  Rockwell’s utterance threatened to distract from a strong broadcast of the program that featured cameos from former cast members Bill Murray and Fred Armisen, as well as a strong opening sketch that made fun of MSNBC morning hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. And viewers heard other bits of profanity during the program: During “Weekend Update,” co-anchor Colin Jost repeated the word “s—hole” that has become an integral part of the recent news cycle after reports surfaced stating President Trump used the phrase to describe certain foreign countries. NBC bleeped out that word on the west coast as well.  In an era when TV viewers routinely hear Samantha Bee utter all kinds of profanity on basic-cable’s TBS and listen to all sorts of once-offensive language on networks ranging from FX to HBO, who cares if someone drops a discouraging word on “SNL”? Simply put, the show airs on broadcast TV, and is held to a different standard by the Federal Communications Commission. What’s more, uttering profanity on the venerable series over its past four-plus decades on air has not often been rewarded.  In February, 1981, cast member Charles Rocket improvised a response to host Charlene Tilton that included the word “f–k,” and the incident that went down in infamy. Rocket was taken off the program. Featured player Jenny Slate inadvertently used a variation of that same word in her debut on the program in September of 2009. While she had a strong first year, and even established herself with a recurring character, she did not return to the program in its next season.  Both of those mishaps took place well after midnight. Last season, actress Kristen Stewart uttered the word in the midst of her monologue on a broadcast in February of last year. Norm MacDonald and Paul Shaffer are among others who have thrown the word out while on the air.  At least one person who swore on a live “SNL” telecast escaped punishment. In 1995, cast member Cheri Oteri uttered the word “s–t” while playing irascible character Rita DelVecchio. Host David Schwimmer called attention to the mistake during the episode’s farewell moments, and Oteri placed some money in a “swear jar.” All was forgiven. Oteri stayed with the program until 2000."

A long, first-person piece published by Babe.net described a date in which they had a sexual encounter despitehim ignoring what she called ""cues"" to stop.  The article sparked intense debate, with many people defending Ansari after he defended himself to call the encounter ""consensual.""  A senior Netflix executive has since said that Ansari is welcome to resume his show — ""Master of None"" — whenever he is ready.  Netflix has said that it is ""ready"" for Aziz Ansari to go back to making shows for it, after the comedian has spent months laying low after being accused of sexual misconduct.  Ansari has not produced any new content for his award-winning show ""Master of None"" since an anonymous woman who went on a date with Ansari said he forced himself on her during despite numerous ""cues"" that she ""wasn't interested.""  The article, published on millennial women's site Babe.net, sparked an online firestorm, with many people questioning whether the situation the woman described really amounted to anything abusive.  Ansari has largely laid low since the article, which he responded to with a statement that everything between the two of them had been ""consensual.""  On Sunday, Netflix programming executive Cindy Holland said: ""We would be happy to make another season of Master of None when Aziz is ready.""  She made comment during the Television Critics Association’s press tour in Beverly Hills.  The Netflix show ""Master of None"" deals with the personal life of Dev, an actor in New York played by Ansari. Netflix  An interview with ""Master of None"" co-creator Lena Waithe in UK newspaper The Independent in March 2018 suggested that Ansari is the reluctant party when it comes to producing more seasons of the show.  ""I mean, I talk to Aziz…but it’s the last thing that ever comes up in our conversations,"" Waithe said.  Netflix did not cancel the show or remove Ansari from the project in response to the article.  Ansari is a creator of the show as well as playing its main character. He won a Golden Globe in 2018 for the role in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy category. He also won an Emmy for the show in 2016 for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.    Ansari previously released a statement about the accusation. Ansari said that sexual activity had occurred but that he thought it was ""completely consensual."" He said the broader #MeToo movement, in which people share their experience with sexual assault, was ""long overdue,"" but did not consider this encounter an example of it.  Ansari used the statement to outline what he thought had happened on the date: ""The next day, I got a text from her saying that although ‘it may have seemed okay,’ upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable.  ""It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned.  ""I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said,"" he said."

Roberto Aguirre Sacasa has been revealing the episode titles through his Twitter, and we’ve got up to episode 28:  Chapter Fourteen: A Kiss Before Dying  Chapter Fifteen: Nighthawks  Chapter Sixteen: The Watcher in the Woods  Chapter Seventeen: The Town That Dreaded Sundown  Chapter Eighteen: When a Stranger Calls  Chapter Nineteen: Death Proof  Chapter Twenty: Tales from the Darkside  Chapter Twenty-One: House of the Devil  Chapter Twenty-Two: Silent Night, Deadly Night  Chapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle  Chapter Twenty-Four: The Wrestler  Chapter Twenty-Five: The Wicked and the Divine  Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart  Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Hills Have Eyes  Chapter Twenty-Eight: There Will Be Blood  Are there any changes to the Riverdale season 2 cast?  Due to Ross Butler’s ongoing commitments with Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, the role of Reggie has been recast, with Charles Melton taking on the role.  Advertisement  Meanwhile Skeet Ulrich, who plays Jughead’s father FP Jones, will be returning to Season 2 as a series regular, after appearing in 7 episodes in Season 1. Speaking to Deadline, series executive producer Sarah Schecter said: “He’s a stellar actor and we feel we have just scratched the surface of who FP is.” Additionally, TVLine confirmed that Casey Cott, who plays Kevin Keller, will also be promoted to series regular.  It’s also been confirmed that Molly Ringwald will be reprising her role as Archie’s mum, Mary Andrews.  And are there any new characters in Riverdale season 2?  There will finally be an appearance from Hiram Lodge, who spent season 1 in jail, with Mark Consuelos having been cast. Marisol Nichols, who plays Hermione Lodge, shared this picture on her Instagram of the newly reunited Lodge family:  According to Deadline, Brit Morgan has been cast in a recurring role as Penny Peabody, known to some as “Snake Charmer”, an attorney the Southside Serpents keep on retainer – but prefers that her clients don’t pay her with currency; instead they pay her with favours. Deadline are reporting that Jughead will discover this, when he enlists her help to help his Dad in prison.  As Entertainment Tonight reported, Vanessa Morgan is also set to be joining the cast, as Toni Topaz. Toni is a member of the Southside Serpents who befriends Jughead. Whether she’ll be a love interest for him hasn’t been confirmed.  Additionally, Hart Denton has been cast as Chic Cooper, the long-lost brother of Betty Cooper.  Is there a Riverdale series 2 trailer yet?  The first trailer for Riverdale Season 2 debuted at San Diego’s Comic Con on July 22.  Once again narrated by Jughead (played by Cole Sprouse), the trailer begins with the line, ‘People will look back as the exact moment that last bit of Riverdale’s innocence finally died’. The footage sees Archie (played by K.J. Apa) taking his father (Fred Andrews – played by Luke Perry) into hospital after he was shot at the end of Season 1. Watch it below:  The second trailer was released on 17 August. The the 30-second teaser sees a shadowy figure reveal that they have “some tragic news to share” – which could relate to the fate of Archie’s father Fred Andrews, who was shot in the season finale.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkJW1xD7BI  Any idea of the plot?  Season 1 left us at a cliff-hanger when Fred Andrews was shot in front of his son Archie. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight show runner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said the identity of Fred Andrew’s shooter will be “The mystery that launches season two”. He also commented on the rumours that the shooting is no accident, saying “I think there’s definitely a lot to that theory… Hermione says to Veronica, very clearly, if Fred doesn’t sell, it’s going to be really bad for him. And the next thing we see is Fred getting shot. I think that’s one of the first, most likely suspects in my mind.”  It’s also been reported that we’ll be finding out Fred’s fate at the end of the first episode.  You find out Fred's ultimate fate at the end of the premiere. #Riverdale #sdcc #wbsdcc — alanna ? (@AlannaBennett) July 22, 2017  Aguirre-Sacasa also commented on the Riverdale “civil war” that could occur in Season 2, saying: “In the finale, Betty alludes to it with Jughead. She says, “I don’t want to let the civil war rip us apart.” I can tell you that there’s a civil war brewing between the north side of Riverdale and the south side. That’s something that will really be playing out and complicating our characters’ lives throughout the season.”  Cole Sprouse took to reddit to answer some fan questions – and commented that the second season would be: “darker and weirder. much darker. much weirder” adding that “tone and genre elements that we touched upon in the cinematography and narrative are getting a big emphasis season 2.”  What about Jughead? Will he be joining the Serpents?  Cole Sprouse has confirmed that Jughead will be joining the Serpents. In an interview with Teen Vogue he said: “Jughead ends up joining the Serpents and he gets wrapped up in this world that forces his hand, forces him to play the game — which is something in season one he had a real aversion to.”  Adding that it doesn’t work out as he would plan: “He ends up getting into a lot of trouble because of it. … He ends up a bit more of a damaged kid. He’s a lot angrier than he was in season one. He ends up coming off as kind of a … not necessarily to say a bad boy, but way more angry, which I also think is a fundamentally key experience. He gets himself into a lot of trouble because of his loyalty and honour to his family and friends, and it begins to make him question where his allegiance lies and what that means for his character — if it means stepping back again or if it means putting a foot back in.”  And what about the Betty-Archie-Veronica love triangle? Will that play out further in Season 2?  Speaking to Entertainment Tonight Aguirre-Sacasa said: “Yeah, I think the love triangle, whether we’re playing it directly, or it’s just bubbling underneath, it’s always sort of a part of the show…”  What about Veronica, is she set to get more involved in the family business?  Speaking to NME on set in Canada, Camila Mendes who plays Veronica, revealed that the character would be getting more involved in the family business. Season two sees her father Hiram Lodge being released from prison and returning home, and when asked whether Veronica would be getting more involved in his shady dealings, Mendes responded: “A hundred percent! Veronica season two is fully committing to the family business, and trying to decide how much of that she should share with Archie and her peers; because it is a big secret, but it’s also her life, and she’s chosen to step up to the plate and be part of the family. And be an established member of the family.”  And will there be any more deaths?  Almost certainly. Speaking to NME, when asked what the rest of season two will entail Mädchen Amick revealed: “There will be many more dead bodies” so it looks like the Black Hood’s reign of terror isn’t over yet."
0,"“House of Cards” star Robin Wright spoke out Monday for the first time about allegations of sexual harassment and assault leveled against her former co-star, telling NBC’s “Today” that she didn’t know Kevin Spacey outside of their professional relationship.  The allegations cost Spacey his job on the Emmy-nominated Netflix show. The drama series was salvaged for a sixth season with the focus shifting firmly to Wright’s Claire Underwood character, who had become a bigger component of the storytelling during the past few years. Wright has been credited with galvanizing the effort to save the show from cancellation after actor Anthony Rapp came forward last November with the allegation that he was assaulted by Spacey when Rapp was 14.  During the interview, Wright spoke about returning to the political tale — and about the embattled star she shared a screen with for nearly five years.  “I think we were all surprised, of course, and ultimately saddened,” Wright told “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie.  Wright emphasized that she did not socialize with Spacey, despite their working relationship as spouses on the Washington, D.C.-set drama. She has not spoken to him since the scandal broke."
0,"It’s not a great sign that “Lowriders” begins with mumbled, sullen narration from our protagonist, teenage tagger Danny Alvarez (Gabriel Chavarria, “East Los High”). Nor are we likely to empathize much with the kid when the camera pulls out and we see the aspiring graffiti artist racing to redecorate L.A.’s Sixth Street Bridge — and then use it as an open-air urinal — while his friends worry about the approaching sirens.  Claudia (Yvette Monreal, “Faking It”) has a college scholarship to protect, so she drives off just in time, leaving Danny and his best friend Chuy (Tony Revolori, far from the lobby of “The Grand Budapest Hotel”) literally holding the bag. A couple of spray paint cans are enough to land the boys in jail, though they get bailed out soon enough by Danny’s father, Miguel (Demián Bichir).  Miguel has finally built himself a quiet life, with devoted girlfriend Gloria (Eva Longoria) and an adorable stepdaughter (Montse Hernandez, “Jane the Virgin”) who’s avidly planning her quinceañera. When he’s not with them, Miguel can be found at his car repair shop in Boyle Heights, working on the revered, pristine 1961 Impala he lovingly calls Green Poison.  Also Read: LA Film Festival Embraces Diversity With 'Lowriders' Opener, Ava DuVernay Award  Miguel — who doesn’t want Danny to join his other son, Francisco (Theo Rossi,”Sons of Anarchy”), behind bars — is intimidating enough to keep Danny on track for a while. But as a recovering alcoholic with lingering anger management issues and a general disdain for human communication, he’s not exactly the easiest guy to connect with. So it’s no surprise that Danny’s an easy mark for Francisco, who gets out of jail nursing a massive, eight-year grudge against his father.  The fact that this furious family feud takes place against the backdrop of utterly sincere, earnestly competitive car worship inevitably undermines the tension Pervuian director Ricardo de Montreuil intends. He and screenwriters Elgin James and Cheo Hodari Coker fumble intermittently, plotting a straight (and predictable) line of heavily-telegraphed revelations and sentimental interactions. And Danny is neither compelling nor complex enough to shoulder this kind of heavy drama.  Also Read: Demian Bichir Joins Cast of 'Conjuring' Spinoff 'The Nun'  But as the movie pulls back from Danny’s typical teenage resentments, de Montreuil wisely allows the other actors to fill more of the frame. Francisco is thinly-written, but the intensely charismatic Rossi — expect to see much more of him — fleshes the character out in fascinating ways. With his wide grins and narrowed eyes, he keeps us constantly on guard, unsure of Francisco’s motives but worried for Danny’s innocence.  Bichir, an Oscar nominee for 2011’s “A Better Life,” is just as impactful. Granted, there are no new insights to be found here about the generational conflict between an artistically wayward son and his old-fashioned, disapproving dad, but the understated Bichir infuses real poignancy into Miguel’s struggles with himself, his history, and his fractured family.  The film’s women don’t fare quite as well. Longoria deepens her brief scenes with warmth and intelligence, but there’s just not much for her to grab hold of. Similarly, though Monreal and Hernandez pull us in with their sweetly-open presences, neither gets a chance to do anything interesting. And as Danny’s hipster girlfriend Lorelei, Melissa Benoist — who ably carries TV’s “Supergirl” — is reduced to a caricature, a superficial symbol of ignorant gentrification.  Also Read: Eva Longoria to Star in Fox Comedy Pilot 'Type-A'  Where de Montreuil excels, though, is in his passionate pushback against that gentrification. Mexican-American culture isn’t merely draped over the story as an added element but woven throughout with a casual practicality that respects both the primary characters and their shot-on-location East L.A. setting.  As for the cars, the movie’s true infatuation, they’re filmed with a contagious rapture; we fully believe that de Montreuil and cinematographer Andres Sanchez appreciate the high-gloss detail on every vintage GTO and hydraulically-enhanced Chevy as much as the chrome-obsessed characters do. And “Lowriders” gives us plenty of opportunity to ogle the objects of his desire: the packed weekend car clubs that Danny and Miguel frequent are shot with such relaxed intimacy, it feels as though we’re watching documentary footage.  So yes, as long as de Montreuil races down the plot’s well-worn path, the story sputters. But when he pulls off to indulge in his real passion, the movie rides just as it should — low and slow."

1,"Erin Jensen  USA TODAY  Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.  “I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago. Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.  Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?  The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.  “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”  He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”  “There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  Valid point, Mr. Theroux.

1,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.  “A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”  The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.  A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”  According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.  The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.  Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained."
1,"Fans believe Taylor Swift's single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" targets Kanye West. Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:  Kanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift's album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother's death.  In response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.  The plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.  Around 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.    Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released — it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.  Though Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.  The subreddit that started it all. Reddit  ""Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim's Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye's font and cover art style for her new album 'Reputation.' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye's mother, Donda West's death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor's songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.""  Not content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit . Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish.  The post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there's an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, ""Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day"" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just ""Hey Mama"" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around."
1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports."
1,"I don't know who is more excited about Khloé's new baby: The Kardashian family or me. (Probably the family, but it might actually be a close call.) By now you've most definitely heard that on April 12, TMZ reported Khloé Kardashian gave birth to her daughter and wow, I feel so emotional just writing that. Don't judge... Kardashian babies just bring it out in me, OK? But now that Kardashian's baby has arrived, the world is so, so happy about it, and of course, the Kardashians' reactions to Khloé Kardashian's baby make me want to cry tears of pure joy. There is too much love, you guys.  UPDATE 2: Kim Kardashian also opened up about Khloé giving birth. She tweeted on April 13, ""@khloekardashian I’m so happy for you! Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy! I can’t wait for our baby girls to grow up as best friends the way we are! I’m so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL."" She also tweeted, ""You guys she’s so gorgeous!!!!!""  UPDATE 1: Kylie Jenner has also sent her congratulations to her big sister on the birth of her baby girl. Jenner posted a photo to Snapchat using a filter that read, ""Kongrats, Khloé! It's a girl!""  EARLIER: Before we dive into the Kardashian love-fest, let's go back to where it all began: That fateful day of Dec. 20, 2017, when Khloé Kardashian gave the world a Christmas miracle in the form of an Instagram post confirming her pregnancy.  She wrote,  My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love!  I will never *not* cry at this announcement, TBH.  As if she didn't do enough simply by sharing her pregnancy, she went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and discussed potential name ideas, though at the time, she had no clue whether she was having a boy or a girl. ""I think if it's a boy I'll go with Tristan Junior,"" she said, adding, ""For a girl I don't even know where to begin. I think I'll go with a K or a T name though.""  The video, which you can check out below, had me screaming:  God bless Khloé Kardashian.  We of course know Kardashian revealed her baby's sex on the season finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, telling her family and fans that she was expecting a little girl:  And then wrote the sweetest message on Twitter, feeling very fortunate to be having a little lady. She wrote,  I am now so excited my daughter will have forever best friends with Chicago and Stormi!! God is great!!! Thank you Lord for our princess  Fans loved seeing Kardashian's reaction about the reveal. Too sweet for words.  When reports first came out that Kardashian gave birth, the entire world collectively screamed and cried tears of joy. Many took to Twitter to express how excited they were.  But the most excited were obviously her siblings and her mom, Kris Jenner. Jenner posted a video of Kendall Jenner repeating the word ""baby,"" that was originally posted by W Magazine. The original caption read, ""When three of your sisters give birth in under a year. Congratulations to @KhloeKardashian on welcoming another girl to the KarJenner clan."" Jenner reposted it, writing, ""BLESSED!!!""  Kourtney Kardashian also posted an Instagram to her page that showed North West, Penelope Disick, and Tracy Romulus' daughter. The caption read, ""GIRL POWER."" This caption could be a tiny clue that Kourtney was celebrating the birth of Khloé's daughter and the sisterhood that is their family.  I am seriously swooning right now.  I love how all the Kardashians are so supportive of one another and so excited for all of the new arrivals in their family as of late (looking at you, Chicago West and Stormi Webster).  A big congratulations to Kardashian and the whole crew!"
1,"The British royal family is a very private bunch, so consequently speculation about their personal lives runs rampant. And now that Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews is approaching, gossip magazines (in particular, The Sun) are reporting that she has the royal equivalent of *beef* with Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle.  The specifics? Apparently, Markle won't be invited to Pippa's wedding thanks to a ""no ring, no bring"" policy—with a source noting, ""It's clear Pippa doesn't want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day.""  Pippa Middleton and James Matthews attend Wimbledon in 2016. Getty Images  Interestingly, Pippa's future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews is also reportedly not allowed to bring his girlfriend, reality television star Vogue Williams. ""Pippa's view is that Vogue's relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,"" the source says. ""But some people in the circle are pretty shocked because this is her future brother-in-law who's going to end up attending on his own. It's certainly raised eyebrows.""  Vogue Williams Getty Images  The Daily Mail also reported on Pippa's ""no ring, no bring"" policy back in March, saying Meghan's appearance at the wedding of Harry's best friend raised concerns.

1,"Getty  After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.  A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun."
1,"The ongoing rumors about Brad Pitt and his ex-wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, continue to swirl regarding a supposed reconciliation between the former couple. The claims have only intensified ever since Jennifer Aniston and her husband of two years, actor Justin Theroux, called it quits recently.  While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to work their way through a very challenging time, involving their own divorce and custody battle over their six children, the pair has been constantly linked to various rumored new loves. Despite Pitt having been falsely linked to a list of beauties, Jennifer Aniston has remained the most frequent female celeb to be rumored as spending time with the heartthrob.  Now the focus is on how Angelina Jolie is reacting to the rumored reconciliation between Pitt and his former wife, Aniston. Reports swirl that Angelina and Jen are gearing up for a showdown over the Allied star and that Pitt is ""freaking out"" over the drama that his and Aniston's supposed closeness has resulted in.  New Idea shares alleged details relayed by a source on the lengthy love triangle between the three. The insider relays that Jen and Angelina have already spoken about the big night that will see the trio in the same room, along with anyone who's anyone in Hollywood and film. The three will all attend the Oscars and the women are said to have discussed boundaries for the occasion that could result in a ""showdown"" between Jen and Angelina.  ""Word is Jen and Angie had a major discussion about the Oscars. It's the biggest night of the year, and they know they'll both be party-hopping,"" the insider states. ""However, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, 'neither are willing to budge an inch,' resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other – something neither are very happy about,"" the publication continues.  The star ex-husband to both these talented beauties is reportedly quite stressed out about the potential words that will be exchanged at one of the entertainment industry's most formal and important events.  ""I heard he's frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs – no good could possibly come from it,"" the insider claims.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently announced their separation in a joint statement, within which the pair stated that they will carry on as friends and to not believe any stories that are making the rounds, reminding that what comes from them is the only truth.  This has not stopped fabrications from swirling. The rumors even now go so far as to say that Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux have met up to find comfort and plot against Jen and Brad over their said reconciliation. This, however, has been debunked and is not to be believed, as Gossip Cop has informed readers.  This latest claim is yet to be verified, and if there is tension between the trio, the stars will likely keep their personal matters out of the prestigious event on Sunday."
1,"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger."

The tape then cuts to a bed, where you don't see the people in the bed ... but hear creaking and what could be people having sex. You never see Kevin in the 2nd clip. The 3rd clip shows 2 people milling around a room, one of them looks vaguely like Kevin.  We're told the person allegedly extorting Kevin has demanded payment from him to avoid the tape's release.

Kevin profusely apologized to his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, and his kids on Instagram Saturday ... saying he recently made some mistakes he deeply regrets.  Sources tell TMZ a woman has allegedly demanded money from Kevin after shooting a video with him in which Kevin and the woman are engaged in ""sexually suggestive"" conduct. We are told it is NOT a sex tape, but looks like it is a prelude to sex. We're told that at a point in the tape when the action is the heaviest, you cannot actually see Kevin."

1,"What’s the key to a successful marriage? A killer engagement ring, perhaps? Brides-to-be Miley Cyrus, Miranda Kerr, Serena Williams, and more were not shy about flaunting their bling!  Not to sound totally shallow, but isn’t the engagement ring just as important as the man giving it to you? In Sex & The City, Carrie Bradshaw actually THREW UP when she saw the hideous ring Aiden Shaw bought for her. That’s not exactly the best way to start the next chapter in your life. Ergo, there’s tons of pressure on dudes to buy the right diamond, the right cut, and the right band. Oh, and the right proposal plan. It may not be easy, but hunks like Liam Hemsworth, Evan Spiegel, and more totally nailed it with their girlfriends!  This year was FULL of romantic proposals! The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they’ll be headed down the alter. Of course we’re talking Miley Cyrus and Liam! Love is officially alive and well again now that these two are back together and head over heels. The “Malibu” singer has been mum about a wedding date, but we hope it’s in the near future!  While some engagements were to be expected, like Miranda Kerr and her CEO founder boyfriend, others were completely out of the blue! Lady Gaga is reportedly engaged to Christian Carino — and they’ve only been dating for about six months! We have not seen a diamond ring from Mother Monster yet, but we can’t wait to catch a first glimpse when she’s ready to share the amazing news with fans. Another big congratulations goes out to reality star Cardi B and rapper Migos, whose engagement news broke just a week ago. So many beautiful weddings to look forward to!  HollywoodLifers, did any of these engagements surprise you? Which proposal story do you think is the cutest?"
1,"CREDIT: Mike Coppola/Getty Images  It’s that time of the week again when the celebrity weeklies hit the newsstands. To separate what’s real and rumor, we turned to our friends at Gossip Cop for the 411 on this week’s most controversial stories.  Beyoncé and Jay-Z have already spent $10 million on their newborn twins, reveals Life & Style. The magazine says they’ve spared no expense on the babies, including buying them Burberry diaper bags, Versace-designed strollers, Chanel linens for their cribs, and even “$2.5 million bejeweled pacifiers.” For what else they’ve outrageously lavished their twins with, go to Gossip Cop.  Brad Pitt is donating to charity everything Angelina Jolie bought him while they were married because it’s too painful to keep the gifts, reveals OK!. The magazine notes the mementos are “antiques, artwork and jewelry,” including a $50,000 gold watch Jolie gave him on their first wedding anniversary. For the one object he’s surprisingly keeping, see what a Pitt pal tells Gossip Cop.  Alex Rodriguez proposed to Jennifer Lopez recently in Paris, and now the singer’s in full wedding planning mode, reveals In Touch. The magazine reports Lopez’s “fairy tale” wedding will cost $3 million and will likely take place at the Palace of Versailles. For inside details about his proposal and their upcoming wedding, see what Rodriguez’s rep admits to Gossip Cop.  Taylor Swift is moving to London to be closer to her British boyfriend Joe Alwyn, reports OK!. The publication notes the singer loves Alwyn, London, and being able to “fly under the radar there” without having to deal with the paparazzi. For the exclusive on the amazing home she’s buying, see what a Swift confidante leaks to Gossip Cop.  Lady Gaga and Christian Carino are already “scouting wedding locations,” reports Life & Style.

1,"Congratulations are in order for Miranda Kerr. The supermodel announced on Wednesday, November 15, that she is expecting a baby with her husband of six months, Evan Spiegel.  This will be the second child for the 34-year-old, who shares custody of son, Flynn, 6, with her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom.  “Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,” a spokesperson tells Us Weekly.  Kerr and the Snapchat founder, 27, were married at their home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood on May 27. They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom “Marry Me” Snapchat filter. “I said yes!!!” wrote the former Victoria’s Secret Angel on Instagram.  Despite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel’s maturity. “He’s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.’s] Venice,” she told The Edit in 2016. “He comes home early. We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”  Kerr once said that parenting Flynn is “the most rewarding thing” she’s ever done. “It has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “Being a working mother is challenging because . . . I never want to leave him — but it’s important to teach your child the value of working.”"
1,"Despite what fans may have heard, Justin Theroux is still getting over his breakup from Jennifer Aniston, a source tells ET.  Rumors have been swirling this week that the 46-year-old actor-writer is dating Petra Collins after his Instagram followers took notice of a photo he posted of himself with the 25-year-old artist back in February. Theroux shared the pic on the same day he was photographed at the Adam Selman show during New York Fashion Week.  ""Justin is still heartbroken,"" a source tells ET, adding that Theroux is not one to play the field but rather prefers to be in a relationship and is still reeling over the fact that his marriage to Aniston did not work out.  Meanwhile, another source tells ET that the former Leftovers star has been relying on his friends to help him cope with the breakup, and notes that Theroux ""had a nice time"" during his ""guys' trip"" to Paris, France, earlier this month.  When abroad, the newly single star attended the Louis Vuitton runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and while his pals might have been eager to hit the town and flirt with women, Theroux was friendly rather than flirty, according to the source.  Getty Images  A third source tells ET that Theroux is, however, ready for ""his next phase in life.""  As for his relationship with Collins, the third source says the two met through Selena Gomez when ""they all hung out together.""  ""She is artsy and edgy and loves the New York nightlife,"" the source says of Collins before calling out that Gomez -- who's also friendly with Aniston -- recently unfollowed the artist on Instagram.  Despite his apparent heartbreak, the source says Theroux is confident that his breakup with the 49-year-old actress was the right decision as their relationship had been ""going south for a long time.""  “He felt confined by their relationship. He wasn't interested with Jen's everyday scheduled life of yoga classes, eating healthy,” the source continues. “Justin is a free spirit and loves his time alone. Justin had a need for independence.”  Reporting by Darla Murray and Adriane Schwartz.

1,"Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth on Her 63rd Birthday  Ken McKay/ITV/REX / Shutterstock.com  Ellen DeGeneres turned 63 on Jan. 26. On her special day this year, she hosted Inauguration poet sensation Amanda Gorman, was treated to a multicolor birthday cocktail created by chef José Andrés of World Central Kitchen, and shared her advice for celebrating a birthday during a pandemic.  The embattled world-famous talk show host typically dedicates an entire episode of her show to the special occasion — including gifts for her audience and cameos by iconic celebrity friends. But this year she addressed a virtual studio audience, promising a “do-over” for the pandemic birthday next year. “As soon as this thing is over, we get two birthdays,” she said. “That means two cakes and two presents per guest, and two hangovers.”  Those fortunate enough to be in the audience for DeGeneres’ birthday show in the past have received Netflix gift cards that covered five years of the subscription service, $300 Lyft rideshare service gift cards and a three-day, two-night stay at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess hotel.  DeGeneres is still struggling to bounce back from a rocky 2020, in which her show was dogged by allegations of a toxic work culture. She’s also only recently recovered from COVID-19, which she contracted in December 2020.  More From Your Money  Find Out: The Richest Celebrity From Every State  Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth: $370 Million  DeGeneres’ net worth is estimated to be roughly $370 million, according to Forbes (though by some estimates it’s as high as $500M). In 2020, DeGeneres made $84 million, retaining the No. 12 spot on Forbes’ list of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. Her wife — actress Portia de Rossi — has her own $50 million fortune, which brings the celebrity couple’s total net worth to $420 million.  Starting out as a stand-up comedian, DeGeneres rose to fame as an actress, starring in the TV series “Ellen” from 1994 to 1998 and “The Ellen Show” from 2001 to 2002. Her daytime talk show, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” debuted on Sept. 8, 2003, and had consistently high ratings until the recent controversies. Upon her return to the show in September, her season premier ratings dropped 29% from the previous season, Variety reported. In 2015, “The Ellen Show” won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. According to Celebrity Net Worth, DeGeneres receives an estimated annual salary of between $75 million and $90 million.  DeGeneres has hosted the Oscars twice, both in 2007 and in 2014. She made history during the 2014 gig by tweeting a group selfie with a gaggle of famous friends, including Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey — a photo that has received more than 3 million retweets since being posted.  DeGeneres famously voiced the character Dory in the 2003 Pixar films “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory.” She’s also found major success behind the camera with her own production company A Very Good Production.  Whoa: 50 Highest-Grossing Actors of All Time  Ellen DeGeneres’ Business Ventures  The tech-savvy superstar launched the site Ellentube in 2014, which hosts exclusive video content from her talk show. In 2015, she also partnered with Vessel to debut one or two clips from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on the streaming site before they’re available anywhere else.  DeGeneres has also ventured into the beauty and fashion world. In 2009, she became the face of COVERGIRL. She also previously served as the spokeswoman for JCPenney and American Express. And her lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen — including clothing, accessories and home decor — launched in 2015.  In late 2017, DeGeneres also debuted a new game show titled “Ellen’s Game of Games” on NBC, expanding the popular games which have been previously featured on her talk show.  More From Your Money  Big Tippers: 10 Celebs Who’ve Left Generous Tips  Ellen DeGeneres’ Real Estate Portfolio  DeGeneres and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 28-year-old.  The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. The couple also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.  In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — DeGeneres sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a California home in 2007 for $20 million, which was later the site of Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.  The total number of properties currently owned by the couple is unknown. DeGeneres released her interior design book “Home” in 2015, which included photos and design tips from many of their past and present residences. Their former Thousand Oaks, Calif. ranch — which they sold in 2013 for $10.85 million — was also previously featured in Elle Décor.  There’s Time: Samuel L. Jackson and 34 Other Celebrities Who Got Rich and Famous Later in Life  Ellen DeGeneres’ Honors and Awards  In November 2016, President Obama presented DeGeneres with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “It’s easy to forget now just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages 20 years ago,” Obama said.

The rapper, 48, who previously confessed to cheating on his wife, was asked about their relationship during an appearance on The Van Jones Show on CNN.  Asked about fighting for their relationship, he told the reporter: 'That's my soul mate. It's the person I love.

For us, we chose to fight for our love, for our family, to give our kids a different outcome, to break that cycle for black men and women, to see a different outcome.'  'We were never a celebrity couple,' he insisted. 'We were a couple who just happened to be celebrities.'  He added the best way to apologize was through 'changed behavior.'

1,"Miranda Lambert and Anderson East were pretty adorable during their two-year-long relationship. If PDA nauseates you, rumors of a breakup are the antacid you need. But if you love love? The dozens of photos, videos, onstage moments and ugga muggas they shared are a reminder of what it can be like to catch lightning in a bottle.  This timeline of Lambert and East's romance starts with a broken heart and might end with one, too, if you believe everything you read at the grocery store. The pile of sources confirming their breakup grows taller and taller, but neither singer has spoken up (they have stopped following each other on Instagram, and though Lambert still follows East on Twitter, he does not reciprocate). Quietly they loved on, until they didn't.  July 20, 2015 — Shock and heartbreak. Lambert and husband Blake Shelton get divorced, ending country music's highest-profile marriage after just four years.  Sept. 12, 2015 — Exactly when Lambert started dating East wasn't clear until she shared this photo two years into the relationship, celebrating Sept. 12 as an anniversary. That's 54 days after her divorce from Shelton. She references the song ""Pushin' Time,"" a song she would later confirm she wrote about East.  During a taping for PBS' Front and Center Lambert would later reveal that the song was actually inspired by an early argument. ""It was all lovey-dovey and then we got in a fight, ’cause that’s how it goes,"" she says. ""And I was pissed, ’cause that’s also how it goes. He tried to smooth it over with me. I said, ‘Are you going to break up with me?’ He said, ‘I think I’ll wait 60 years.’ So, sweet.""  Jan. 1, 2016 — After weeks of speculation, the couple go public with a New Year's Day photo of them cuddling together on a couch and the caption: ""The snuggle is real.""  Feb. 14, 2016 — During their two years together (and some change), one half of this couple would often storm the other's stage to sing a song or two. This Valentine's Day performance of ""Always Be My Baby"" (yes, the Mariah Carey hit) is the first documented time it happened. A Taste of Country News video also recalls how deep in it the country singer was. She wore a University of Alabama hat for him, which is saying something for a Texas girl!  April 2, 2016 — At the ACM Awards Lambert and East walk the red carpet for the very first time together. Her dress remains our favorite of her many glam looks. As for East, he'd only get one more shot on awards show carpet. In total, they hit six red carpets together.  July 17, 2016 — Lambert shares a photo of the couple kissing on Instagram with a caption that reads, ""Happy Birthday to my favorite 'Bama' boy!"" Photos of the two together were not rare by this point. East would also regularly Insta-flirt with his girlfriend of 10 months.  Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2016 — The couple walk the BMI Awards and CMA Awards red carpet together and looked great. ""I was the big winner last night,"" East would later say on Instagram.  A few days later, Lambert responded to trolls who criticized her appearance with a sharply-worded post on Instagram that quoted Maya Angelou: ""Cowardly people hiding behind a keyboard or a cell phone writing their useless comments about our eyes and clothes and body language. What a bunch of bull s--t.""  March 12, 2017 — Still dueting, still happy! East joins Lambert onstage during a Highway Vagabond Tour stop in Bossier, City, La., singing the Faces' ""Stay With Me."" The song is unabashedly sexual, and Lambert and East definitely play on that in their performance, turning in a flirtatious, touchy-feely performance that lets their real-life chemistry shine through.  April 1, 2017 — After the ACM Awards in Las Vegas, the pair share Instagram messages in reference to Lambert's Female Vocalist of the Year win. ""Couldn't be more proud of this little lady and the amazing art she brings with her,"" East says on Instagram. Lambert follows with this:  July 16, 2017 — One day before East's 30th birthday, Lambert grabs his microphone in New York and delivers a slow, sultry version of ""Happy Birthday."" The crowd joins in, and it's magical:  June 6-7, 2017 — Lambert and East make two appearances together at the 2017 CMA Music Festival, including her MuttNation March and the CMT Awards. Lambert then flies solo to the 2017 Taste of Country Music Festival.  Public appearances together slow after this. In fact, we found only one more.  Nov. 8, 2017 — At the 2017 CMAs, Lambert sparkles like a princess next to East in his usual black and white ensemble. The walk united and speak united after Garth Brooks lip syncs during his performance. First East blasted the Entertainer of the Year on Instagram, and she responded in the comments:  Instagram  January 12, 2018 — Lambert shares what seems to be the last public photo of the couple together, though she continues to like his photos on social media through February 18. They no longer follow each other on Instagram.  March 3, 2018 — Tabloids started reporting a breakup in February, but it was Lambert's comments during a March show in Knoxville, Tenn., that truly stir the pot.  ""I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes,"" she said, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. ""That's my favorite. And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one.""

1,"Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have moved on in their professional lives since they got separated last year but rumours about their personal lives keep swirling on the internet. A recent report claims that the A-list Hollywood actress is upset about the thought of her estranged husband dating another woman and keeps track of him through their common friends.  ""Angelina's hyper-aware of what Brad's up to, she's always trying to keep tabs on him. They still have friends in common and she quizzes them for info. She knows Brad's ready to start dating again,"" a source told Hollywood Life.  The report by the entertainment website claims that the 42-year-old Salt actress ""hates the idea"" of Pitt moving on in his life ""emotionally"". ""It's a hard pill for her to swallow and that's got her wanting to do the same. She's very competitive and hates the idea of him beating her to the punch. Plus it drives her crazy that he's emotionally moved on since she really hasn't.""  The actress is currently focussing on her family and was often spotted going out with her six children. Pitt, on the other hand, is having a busy filming schedule and is reportedly ready to date again. Recently, he has been linked with Ella Purnell, a British actress who is 32 years younger than him.  ""Right now Angelina's still not started dating but she has been getting closer to pulling the trigger. Hearing Brad is looking to date again made her feel motivated to find someone too. Even though her mind really isn't in that space she hates the idea of 'losing' to him. She's started forcing herself to open her eyes and look around and a few guys have caught her eye,"" the Hollywood Life source claimed."
1,"The Fifty Shades Darker press tour will begin soon, but fans might be disappointed as the lead actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have refused to promote the film, gossip websites say so.  Also Read: Are Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan expecting first child?  According to reports, Johnson and Dornan have refused to promote the film. Fans of the novel are of the opinion that Johnson and Dornan are ""horribly miscast"" for the lead actors' role – Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.  ""Fans should at least be seeing Jamie and Dakota out and about, if not talking to the press about the movie. Even paparazzi are having a hard time locating them,"" Celebs Dirty Laundry reported quoting sources.  According to reports, Dornan is trying to shed Christian Grey's image from the Fifty Shades franchise, as he is looking for different roles in Hollywood for months now. Dornan does not want his fans to remember him only for his role in the Fifty Shades franchise.  However, Gossip Cop has debunked the news and said that Dornan and Johnson are gearing up to promote the film, which is set for Valentine's Day release.  Fifty Shades Darker has been in the spotlight again for the wrong reasons. Earlier, the Celebs Dirty Laundry reported that critics are not happy with the sex scenes in the movie due to which Johnson and Dornan are forced to reshoot the scenes.  Critics who saw the film laughed off watching Johnson and Dornan's intimate scenes. Though Johnson and Dornan tried hard to maintain the chemistry, they could not perform up to the mark, thus making the second instalment film worse than the first part.  However, Gossip Cop also debunked this report as well. The website quoting sources reported that the makers have wrapped up the film and the lead pair is not shooting the sex scenes again."
1,"SELENA Gomez has become embroiled in the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie divorce, amid sensational claims a picture of her cosying up to the actor at the Golden Globes caused issues in his marriage.  The Sun reports the 24-year-old, who appeared briefly in the film The Big Short with Pitt, shared a picture of herself gazing into the dad-of-six’s eyes as they enjoyed a moment together at the start of this year. The photo was captioned: “just discussing #TheBigShort.”  At the time, the brunette singer made no secret of how attractive she found the 52-year-old, saying: “I’m not going to lie. It’s nice to look at all of the hot guys I admire. I’m trying to find Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt right now!”  However according to the National Enquirer, the image did not go down well with Pitt’s wife of two years.  “Angie blew a gasket when she saw Selena’s Instagram, and heard through friends about how brad and Selena flirted so shamelessly,” a source said.  The source continued: “Now Selena is bragging to everyone that Brad is gung ho to make another movie with her. Selena is going around jokingly calling Brad ‘my future husband’, and Angie is obviously none too pleased.”  According to the publication, Jolie demanded that Pitt didn’t work with the young star again. Gomez previously dated Justin Bieber and was linked to Orlando Bloom.  “Angie warned Brad to cut all ties with Selena, and she’s forbidding him from working with her again,” the source said.  A little tb and a happy birthday to one of the kindest people I know AND someone who has inspired me for years! A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Feb 11, 2016 at 6:25pm PST  Jolie filed for divorce from her partner of 12 years on Monday. Divorce papers show the Hollywood actress wants overall physical custody of their six children — not joint custody with Pitt — after citing irreconcilable differences.  RELATIONSHIP TIMELINE  It’s thought that numerous factors have contributed to her decision, including claims he grew too close to his Allied co-star Marion Cottilard and that his reported weed consumption and temper had got too much for her and she was concerned about the environment she was bringing up the kids in.  Following the news, Pitt went public with a statement about his impending divorce which read: “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.”  He has also categorically denied the allegations of his supposed affair.  Jolie released a similar statement saying that the divorce was for the “health of the family.”  This story originally appeared in The Sun."
1,"Jennifer Aniston. Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  Jennifer Aniston has been extremely fine and okay and great for some time now — she’s married to the artfully manscaped Justin Theroux, she’s working on a show with Reese Witherspoon, and her ex-husband Brad Pitt is in the process of divorcing Angelina Jolie, the woman he started seeing while he and Aniston were still married, a sad fact that must send a shiver of schadenfreude up Jen’s spine now and again. But Aniston doesn’t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar:  My dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a café with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you’re not deprived. I’m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you’re more joyful. There’s a life’s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.  All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:  I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin’s face. He was like, “What is happening?”  Alarming. But that probably wouldn’t happen at Jen’s wellness center of course, because she’s fine, it’s fine, everything’s extremely fine."
1,"In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. “Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively of the pair. “It was an extremely emotional and testing few days.”  The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, “have been fighting constantly over Nicole’s incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,” adds the insider. The trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. “It was Keith’s idea to visit the boot camp,” says the insider. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. “He gave her an ultimatum.”  But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. “They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,” the insider explains.

She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet, and, “Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.”  Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.

1,"Now that's a hot couple in the making. Rumour has it that Brad Pitt, following his separation from Angelina Jolie, has his attention diverted to Jennifer Lawrence. According to gossip mongers, the Allied actor has shown interest in dating the Hunger Games star and this will definitely get Jolie worked up.  Sources told Australian tabloid Woman's Day that the actor feels Lawrence fits his criteria of a perfect girlfriend.  ""Jennifer 'ticks' all of Brad's boxes in all the right ways. She's gorgeous, the hottest name in Hollywood and seems to like older guys,"" the insider told the magazine, referring to her recent boyfriend and Mother! director Darren Aronofsky. It was recently confirmed that the director-actress couple are no longer dating each other.  Coming back to JLaw and Pitt, the grapevine claims that Pitt had reached out to director Quentin Tarantino to help him get Lawrence's phone number. The two actors are apparently texting each other and getting to know each other better.  The source maintains that while Pitt is attracted to Lawrence, he has an interior motive in all this. Apparently, the actor is looking at dating women who can ""make Angelina Jolie jealous,"" and Lawrence fits the bill.  ""Brad hasn't dated much since the breakdown of his marriage, so Jen is a very lucky girl to have his undivided attention. He can't wait to get to know her better, and if all goes well, he thinks they could be Hollywood's next big power couple,"" the insider explains.  While this is a juicy gossip, Gossip Cop argues that there is no truth in the claim. Contradicting Woman's Day's sources, the website's insiders claim that these are merely rumours and hold no truth.  ""The actor hasn't been pursuing Lawrence, nor is he on a mission to make his estranged wife jealous,"" the site reports. However, there has been no confirmation or denial from the two actors' managers or representatives."
1,"Millions around the world watched as Meghan Markle tied the knot with Prince Harry last Saturday, walking down the aisle of St. George's Chapel in a custom gown designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.  The day also marked the big reveal for the fashion world -- after months of anticipation and speculation -- of the wedding dress and designer Clare Waight Keller. Keeping the secret of who would design the royal wedding gown under wraps was no easy task, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie.  Markle, who already had a stash of bridal dress ""inspo"" pictures saved on her phone from Instagram, Pinterest and elsewhere online, began her search for a designer at the urging of her best friend, Jessica Mulroney, according to Scobie, who revealed details of the dress selection process in a Harper's Bazaar article.  Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, already knew what she wanted in her wedding dress: something timeless, elegant and appropriate, Scobie added.  While many designers threw their names in the running to be picked by Markle to design her dress, Waight Keller had been a favorite since the beginning. The designer and bride to be met just before Christmas, Scobie said, and Markle immediately liked what she saw.  “I think she had seen my work and knew what I did,” Waight Keller said in comments to the press after the wedding. “I think she loved the fact that I was a British designer and working in a house such as Givenchy, which has its roots in a classical, beautiful style from the time of Hubert [de Givenchy] himself.”  After Markle officially chose Waight Keller to create her dress, the designer had to keep it a secret from everyone, even her own family, until the wedding day.  Mostly through discreet texts and phone calls, Markle and Waight Keller went back and forth on designing the dress before two teams signed nondisclosure agreements and got to work on it at Givenchy's Paris headquarters and an undisclosed London warehouse, according to Scobie.  Creating the iconic dress ""was all about keeping the secret,"" Waight Keller said.  Hundreds of hours of meticulous stitching later, the finished gown was transported to Windsor Castle for a final fitting in May and was revealed to the world last Saturday.  Keller called the royal wedding a ""dream day"" in a post on Instagram.  Waight Keller also told the press that Prince Harry thanked her for designing the dress for his bride.  ""He came straight up to me and he said, 'Oh my God, thank you! She looks absolutely stunning,'"" Waight Keller recalled. ""Well, I think everybody saw on television -- he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed."""

1,"Does Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima’s social media snafu meant they’re on the rocks? Scott Disick hopes so, as we’ve heard he’ll gladly ‘ghost’ Sofia Richie if Kourt’s single again.  When Kourtney Kardashian, 38, deactivated her Instagram and her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, 24, made his account private, many thought there was trouble in paradise between these two. While everything seems to be back to normal, Scott Disick, 34, certainly hopes something is up, as a source close to “The Lord” EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that he’s praying “that Kourtney unfollowing Younes on social media is the beginning of the end for Kourtney and her boy toy. Scott has never stopped loving Kourtney and he always will.” Uh-oh. Well, bad news for Scott: Kourt’s back on the ‘gram and following Younes.  Looks like Scott’s ready to swoop in the second Kourt’s back on the market. Wait. What about Sofia Richie? Scott has had quite the love affair with the 19-year-old. They’ve travelled the world and were even seen having lunch together a few weeks ago. Will Scott stay by Sofia’s side if his baby mama suddenly becomes Younes-less? “If it turns out Kourtney is single again,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, “you can bet that Scott will ghost Sofia and start spending more time at home with Kourt and the kids. As much fun as Scott has been having with Sofia, he still loves Kourt very much and would love to put his family back together.”  That’s….actually a bit harsh for Sofia. Even if this romance with Scott is “just a phase,” like her father Lionel Richie said it is, she doesn’t deserve to get ghosted by Scott the moment Kourt is single. Plus, even if she and Younes have split, it’s not like she’s going to throw open the doors and welcome Scott (and all his problems) back in her life. “The Lord” might want to take a hint and let go of those reconciliation dreams of his.  Also, with Scott ready to spend more with his ex and the kids, Sofia might want to hold on making any long-term plans with her current boyfriend. “Scott has been in a lot of pain since Kourt began sleeping with Younes,” the insider added, “and he’s has been waiting for the day that she deletes him from social media. Scott is hopeful that this as a major sign that it’s the beginning of the end for Kourt and Younes.”"

1,"Post-divorce with Chris Pratt, Anna Faris will openly admit that she's struggling with whether marriage is worth it anymore. ""I need to figure out what the purpose is,” the actress said on Monday’s episode of Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert podcast. “Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then there’s like the untangling in terms of the state getting involved.”  This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  The only immediate benefit Faris could name is that marriage makes people take your relationship more seriously. “There is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man as opposed to a man with a girlfriend. I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship—I’m not saying it’s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.”  Faris later talked about the pressure she and Pratt felt being a beloved, popular Hollywood couple—and the internet's reaction of ""love is dead"" after they announced they were separating. “Chris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like on the Twitter feed, yes like ‘Love is dead’ and ‘relationship goals,'” she started. “I think what we were also guilty of—although we had an unbelievable marriage and we have a great friendship now, we love our son to death, and I’m really proud of that because I’m not sure I did that well the first time [Faris was married before to Ben Indra from 2004-2008]. But I do think we obviously cultivated something, and it was rewarding for a while. It was like ‘Oh, People seem to think we got all this shit all right.’”  Faris confirmed that ""yes,"" she felt a weird pressure because of her and Pratt's couple fame, especially at the end of their relationship. ""I don’t know if embarrassment [of letting fans down] is quite the right word. Something akin to that. I had a little bit of a childish feeling of ‘Oh come on, fucking grow up!’ Like, [there was] a little anger. But that’s not fair either, because I cultivated it though,” she explained. “We intentionally cultivated this idea of like, ‘Look at this beautiful family.’ There were so many moments that were like that but of course just like anything on social media, you don’t post like, ‘Where the fuck is the toilet paper?!’ or whatever. I think it’s a very hard forum to be genuine, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.""  Faris is currently dating cinematographer Michael Barrett. Pratt and Faris announced their separation in August 2017. ""Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,"" Pratt wrote then. ""We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.""  This content is imported from Facebook.

Bendjima wrote on a bikini shot of Kardashian, ""thats what you need to show to get likes?"" according to TMZ, before promptly deleting the remark. That comment struck a nerve with Kardashian. ""Kourtney doesn't appreciate Younes posting his feelings in a public forum and being impulsive,"" a source told the outlet. ""She's frustrated that he continues to get upset about it.

Bendjima's issues with Kardashian's more revealing Instagrams, despite him also posting revealing Instagrams, have been an ongoing point of contention between the two and led them to breakup once before, People reported yesterday.  But Kardashian isn't about to stop living her life as she pleases, and Bendjima is going to try to get used to it. ""Kourtney has explained its part of her job and it's not going to change,"" the source said. ""But it still makes him uncomfortable and upset. He overreacted and put up a comment without thinking it through. Then he realized what he did made it even worse. He was just not thinking in the moment and got emotional. [He ultimately] wants to be able to deal with this side of Kourtney's life and knows he needs to accept it if they are going to be together.""

1,"Most people spend the weeks after their 16th birthday eagerly awaiting their GCSE results or choosing between sixth form and college, but for Kaia Gerber it was a different story. Just four days since reaching the legal age limit for models walking on the catwalk and a few after her first photo shoot for British Vogue was released, the daughter of Cindy Crawford made her runway debut in Raf Simons's sophomore Calvin Klein 205W39NYC collection. And what a debut it was. Taking the fourth-exit slot in a black-and-white stiff-collared shirt with canary-yellow trousers and a colour-pop turquoise polo-neck, Kaia transformed from the all-American girl we know and love her to be to a new-gen mid-West cowgirl. It was a look that Jessie from Toy Story would definitely not resist slipping into. Speaking of her big debut, Kaia took to Instagram to share enthusiasm for her first booking. ""There are no words to describe how I feel"", she wrote. ""I love you endlessly Raf!"" Growing up in a household where catwalking is a normal everyday profession - Kaia's brother Presley has already followed in their mother's footsteps and walked in shows including Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana and Moschino - her debut walk in front of every single big-name editor came with a nonchalant ease that has already seen her being booked for the Alexander Wang and Fenty x Puma and Coach shows. But Kaia's first fashion week didn't end in New York. The model travelled across the pond to join her brother on Christopher Bailey's September show catwalk. In pictorial form, go inside Kaia's first run of shows:"
1,"Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa may look happy when the cameras are rolling on Live with Kelly and Ryan, but for one of them, the show is not that great.  Yes, we're talking about Ryan here.  The former American Idol host needs to spend a lot of time New York City in order to keep up with his co-hosting duties on the morning talk show... and he ain't pleased about it.  According to Radar, life in the Big Apple is not all it has cracked up to be for Ryan, and he allegedly yearns for the weekend so he can hope across the country to Los Angeles.  “Ryan is miserable,” the insider dishes, adding that relocating to the New York City has been “the biggest mistake of his life.”  Yikes.  There's even word the 42-year-old has become a recluse, despite being invited to some of the most exclusive parties in town.  “He hasn’t embraced the city and hasn’t been going out to the restaurants or parties,” the insider continues.  “He’s invited to almost every event every night and doesn’t go!”  Living in New York City would be a dream for most, but Ryan has been known as someone who likes the sunny weather of Los Angeles.  “He’s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much.”  Probably making matters worse is that the ratings are actually down 25 percent vs. last year for the show. Ryan will likely be feeling that he's party responsible for that.  Network execs don't like when ratings are down and generally try to get rid of the problem quickly. With Kelly as a long-standing host, it would make sense to keep her around.  Ryan, however, is likely expendable.  Kelly has been known in the past to not get along with her co-hosts, and if recent reports to be believed, she is not getting along with Ryan.  Another thing probably irks Ryan is that ABC is rebooting American Idol and he's very busy with Live. Word on the street is that he has been offered over $10 million for his hosting duties.  Seems like a decent salary, right?  Well, Katy Perry has been confirmed as the first judge and is getting $25 million for her services. That's a huge pay gap and considering Ryan has been on the show since 2002.  So, it seems like things are not working out for Ryan right now.  What will he do? Will he stick it out in New York, or return to his roots in Los Angeles?  Sound off below!"

Marion Cotillard, the French actress and Dior ambassador known for her demure and ladylike style, showed off a new, um, look on Instagram on Monday — complete with a dark wavy wig and full pout — that had us wondering if she had found a long-lost Kardashian kousin.  It was the 41-year-old's plump lips (which she noted were for her role in the film, Rock'n Roll, which was released last month in France) that had her fans buzzing, with many drawing comparisons to Kylie Jenner's infamous pout, as well as the full puckers of Rose McGowan and Angelina Jolie.  However, though Cotillard made it clear that the get-up was for a role, and not a personal choice, she appeared to be feeling it.  A post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:05pm PST  The actress posted — count 'em — 18 selfies to give her fans a glimpse of every possible angle of the look, including several which showed off her cleavage. Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock'n Roll), utilized Instagram's new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans' feeds.  The successive posts tie Rihanna's record of 18 selfies in a 24-hour period, which the singer had posted in celebration of the Crop Over festival in her native Barbados in 2015.

'You have marriages within marriages...that's what I want in marriage,' she added at the time.  The now 49-year-old actress and her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who reunited shortly after Jen split from Justin Theroux in early 2018, have decided to give their failed marriage a second chance.

1,"Although the leading causes of chronic kidney disease are mainly diabetes or high blood pressure, other related conditions, such as Lupus, can also impact the kidneys. Kidneys play a critical role in the body—acting as the body's filtering system, removing wastes, and controlling blood pressure--and once they fail dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed just to stay alive.NKF CEO, Kevin Longino, said, “Kidney disease has been part of my own life for as long as I can remember, affecting three generations of my family. I am alive today because of the kidney transplant I received 13 years ago from an anonymous deceased donor—and there isn’t a day that goes by when I do not give thanks to the family who, despite their tragic loss, allowed me to live.I would like to extend my heartfelt support to Selena as she continues her journey towards kidney health. Finding a match is not easy; and I am sure she feels immensely blessed and grateful to her dear friend, Francia Raisa for the gift of life. To all of us, she is nothing short of a hero.”There are currently more than 100,000 people on the kidney transplant wait list –and the average wait time is long, three to five years or longer. But many kidney patients never get a transplant because they are afraid to ask their family members and friends for help. National Kidney Foundation can help people start the conversation through a special free program called The Big Ask: The Big Give . Our goal is to get as many people off the waiting list as possible and help all of them find a second chance at life.Ms. Gomez’s brave public acknowledgement of the battle she’s been privately facing, and the gift of life she received, will give strength to others to do the same."

He added the star-studded event was also a big step in Jolie's reconciliation with her father. ""Jon says his and Angelina's relationship is very nice,"" Taylor spilled to Radar.

1,"Ever since Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, there have been rumors about the former actress struggling to fit in with the royals.  These reports were inevitable of course, but they've been somewhat more vicious and persistent than we anticipated.  Insiders (or people purporting to be insiders, or tabloid columnists writing as imaginary insiders) claim that Meghan has breached royal protocol several times in her six weeks as a Duchess.  Naturally, these folks insist that the Queen is not happy with Meg's performance thus far.  Kate Middleton, on the other hand, is reportedly loving every minute of it.  A source tells the never-reliable Star magazine that Kate has been “gleefully watching Meghan’s blunders from the sidelines.”  Those blunders include such egregious offenses as wearing a dress that didn't cover her shoulders.  Oh, and let's not forget the time that Meghan tried to hold Harry's hand in public!  We're still clutching our pearls over that one.  Apparently, Kate is supposed to be helping Meghan out with all this confusing nonsense, but when the time came to lend a hand to her fellow lapsed peasant, she was all like, nah:  “You’d think that as a fellow commoner, she’d be sympathetic to how Meghan is struggling, but Kate feels threatened by Meghan’s popularity,” the insider reveals.  “Kate takes potshots at Meghan every chance she gets and makes a point to tell the queen about all the things Meghan is doing wrong.”  Oh, what we would give to hear Kate flex that stiff upper lip to spit some royal zingers.  ""Ay bish, you used to be on Suits but you couldn't find a tailor for that baggy-ass wedding dress?""  ""I heard you were a model on Deal on No Deal. Maybe you should've said no deal to that fugly hat, nahmean?""""  And so forth.  Anyway, it all sounds very far-fetched, but this isn't the first report we've heard that Kate and Meg aren't exactly beasties:  ""Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing [Queen Elizabeth],” a source recently told some tabloid called Closer Weekly.  ""Kate feels left out. She spent years working on her image as 'the perfect royal,' and Meghan is stealing her thunder,""  Yes, a real feud might be taking place among the duchesses.  If only we could convince them to star in a reality show about their classy beef."

Kim did just that on July 13, going out on the town nearly naked ! She hit up Shibuya sushi restaurant in Calabasas in a clear plastic vinyl “dress” that exposed her bare boobs. The only thing she was wearing underneath was a small pair of creme silk panties and over it she had on a light grey duster that had to have been taped down very strategically because it rested right at her nipple line.

1,"Share this article:  Star magazine’s new cover claims “Kim & Kanye’s $1 billion divorce announcement” is full of made-up or quotes and conjecture.  And: “To the shock of no one, the lemmings at Hollywood Life have already picked up this false report.”  So says Gossip Cop, the celebrity hoax-busting site, which also said of Hollywood Life: We’ll be on the look-out for them to flip-flop with the ‘truth’ in the coming days.”  Posted Wednesday, the story by Shari Weiss focuses on a cover quote supposedly from Kim Kardashian that “I’ll raise our surrogate baby alone.”  The source of the comment in Star is unidentified, however.  “It’s actually the alleged source speculating, ‘She would be completely fine raising the baby alone.’ That has a far different implication than what readers are told on the cover,” Weiss writes.

Justin Theroux looked to have been hitting the gym big time when he was spotted with a couple tickets to the gun show.  While we’re sure he wasn’t banking on being spotted, as he headed out with a companion on a coffee date last week in New York, there was no going incognito when you’re sporting biceps the size of the Big Apple.

Since his split from wife Jen – after the two got married in a secret ceremony in 2015 – Justin has also been linked to artist Petra Collins and actress Aubrey Plaza.

There’s nothing more to it.’  According to reports, Justin has been busy ‘doing his thing’ in New York, while Aniston remained in LA.  A source told People: ‘Now, he’s apparently just enjoying the single life in New York and sticking to a pretty basic routine. He’s just doing his thing. He eats at the same time, goes to the same places, hangs with the same people.’  …getting coffee with curly-haired brunettes…  Now if you don’t mind, we’ll just be down here doing push ups.

1,"While her husband, Joe Giudice, sits in prison, Teresa Giudice has a new romance in her life, at least a new report claims.  Us Weekly claims this week that the ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" star has been seeing a New Jersey businessman.  Gregory Pace/BEI/Shutterstock  A source tells the mag that the reality star ""hasn't visited Joe in prison for a few months.""  Teresa's former pal Kim DePaola said, ""They've been pretty cozy I'm going to say in the last five months."" She added, ""I think Teresa has every right to go out and find somebody else. She should leave Joe.""  WENN  Kim, no friend of Joe's, said she learned of the alleged relationship from two separate people.  ""She should be with somebody else,"" Kim claimed. ""She should divorce Joe.""  Teresa's lawyer blasted the allegations, telling Us that his client ""vehemently denies these allegations. They are 1,000 percent false and have been manufactured by attention-seeking lowlifes who have no moral compass. The only man in Teresa's life is Joe Giudice. Period. End of story.""  Rex USA  This a bit of a role reversal from several years ago when Teresa was imprisoned and reports surfaced that Joe was cheating on her. Joe denied those reports, as did Teresa.  ""No woman has ever come up to me and said that my husband was having an affair with them,"" Teresa told People last year. ""It's sad that if there are any women around him people take pictures of him and sell the photos to a magazine. I feel bad for him.""  She said she saw images of Joe with other women, but she knew who they were.  ""He could be out with friends that are single and, you know if they're talking to girls, that doesn't mean that Joe is doing anything just because a girl is sitting at the same table as them. So I feel bad for him in a way. Because the poor guy, you know, he's not doing that."""

The firstborn, girl or boy, will be heir, experts tell PEOPLE  When Prince William and Kate‘s official announcement that she is pregnant came Monday, the palace said she was “expecting a baby.”  But in light of the fact that the Duchess of Cambridge is also suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a form of acute morning sickness, there has been growing speculation that she may, in fact, be expecting twins.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to the National Institutes of Health, the Duchess’s rare condition tends to appear more often in women carrying twins.  So what would it mean for the royal family if Kate, 30 – who was discharged from the hospital Thursday – were to deliver two little royals? A pair of heirs?  Nope, royal experts tell PEOPLE. In fact, it’s all a bit complicated.  The firstborn twin would have a completely different path than his or her sibling, says royal historian Robert Lacey, author of The Queen: A Life in Brief: “The first child to appear will have precedence. Whichever one comes out first will be the heir – and it will be the call of the obstetrician if there is a caesarean section.”  And the obstetrician will make that delivery based on the location of the babies during labor, Mark Johnson, Professor of Obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, tells PEOPLE.  Says Johnson: “If delivering vaginally, the first baby to enter the pelvis will be delivered first. If delivering by c-section it very much depends on the which baby is closest to the incision, generally that will be the lower of the two babies.”  A year ago, the British government voted to modernize the rule of succession so that in the event of twins, a firstborn girl would not lose the title of heir if a boy were to be subsequently born to the royal couple. But that rule hasn’t been implemented yet.  Under the current law of the land, says Lacey, “If the twins are a girl first followed by a boy, the boy will be next in succession.”  When or if the law is changed, adds Lacey, “the boy would be ousted by his sister.”  If Kate is pregnant with twins, William, who will surely be present for the births, will be able to see firsthand which baby is born first. But in the past that wasn’t the case, adds Lacey."
1,"Ben Affleck has returned to rehab as he continues to struggle with sobriety.  Jennifer Garner drove her estranged husband to an LA area facility on Wednesday afternoon, ET has learned. The 46-year-old actor knew he needed help and Garner was there for him, a source tells ET.  Affleck revealed in March 2017 that he had completed treatment for alcoholism in order to be ""the best father I can be,"" but his history with addiction goes back much further. In fact, his experience with alcoholism began as a child, watching his own father, Timothy, battle the disease.  Affleck has opened up about his past with alcoholism from his family's cycle of addiction to his 2001 rehab stint.    1986: Parents' Divorce  ""To be honest with you, the marriage was so bad, and I remember feeling relief,"" Affleck told Barbara Walters in a 2012 interview, reflecting on his parents' divorce when he was just 12 years old.  A Timeline of Ben Affleck's Struggles With Sobriety This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.    If you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page. Embed Code Restart  ""[My father] was an alcoholic... I did know that as a child. He drank a lot. My father was a -- what did they call him -- a real alcoholic. He, you know, drank all day, drank every day, and to his credit, he got sober ultimately,"" he revealed. ""He's been sober for several decades, which I think is pretty impressive.""  ""[He] turned his life around in a very laudable way,"" the actor told The Daily Mail in 2008. ""But having such serious addiction issues has a major impact -- it colors who you are and becomes a part of you.""  Though he considered his childhood difficult, Affleck said it was his friend, Matt Damon, and brother, Casey, that helped him deal with his father's alcoholism and parent's divorce.  ""I had good friends. I had Matt Damon, I had my brother, and I had a nucleus of friends that I grew up with and I had support from,"" he told Walters.    1997: Managing Sobriety With Fame  It was a close collaboration with Damon that gained them both fame after 1997's Good Will Hunting -- shortly after which a 24-year-old Affleck stopped drinking.  ""I just wanted to stop. I started regretting some things I did when I was drunk. It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it's like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl,'"" he told a reporter in 1998. ""I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me.""    2001: 30-Day Rehab Program  In July 2001, after a reported night of hard partying while between his high-profile relationships with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez, Affleck completed a 30-day residential rehabilitation program for alcohol abuse, driven to Promises in Malibu by his friend, Charlie Sheen,People reported at the time. After news broke to the press, his publicist confirmed Affleck's rehab stay. ""Ben is a self-aware and smart man who has decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol,"" the rep stated. ""He is committed to traveling to a healthier road with the support of his family friends and fans.""  ""I went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be,"" Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012, declining to go into further detail. ""It was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.""    2004: Jennifer Garner's Positive Influence  In 2004, Affleck married Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner, who a source tells ET put a stop to Affleck's hard partying ways and helped the actor settle down.  According to the source, friends noticed a significant change in the actor after the two got together, noting that Affleck was different than with past women he had dated. He settled down with Garner's positive influence, which ""lasted for a long time"" -- until the pair's split in June 2015.  ""I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and it’s good,"" Affleck said in a January 2017 interview with The Guardian, reflecting on his past mistakes and his three children with Garner: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Sam, 5.  ""I’d always had a strong idea about my values and the direction I wanted to be headed in, then I ran into getting famous and it totally spun me around and I flailed around for a few years,"" he confessed. ""When you’re a young man in your 20s, part of that is making mistakes and learning from them. I just made those in front of everybody, rather than privately.""  January 2017: Spotted Out With Sober Coach  Affleck handled his most recent stint in rehab much more privately, though clues to the actor's struggles appeared in January, when the father of three was spotted with a blonde woman while out and about in Los Angeles.  Though some at the time speculated that Affleck might have moved on from Garner (despite living on the same compound), a source told ET at the time that the woman was Elizabeth Weaver, a sober coach with whom he was working to make ""sure he stays on the right path.""  ""Ben has spent a good amount of time with her in recent weeks to kick his alcohol addiction,"" the source said. ""Ben is taking getting sober very seriously and knows he has to do this for his kids. Ben would do anything for his children and is hoping this will make his relationship with Jen better.""  February 2017: Staying Sober at the Oscars  A source tells ET that though Affleck is no longer working with Weaver, he was sober at the 2017 Academy Awards while supporting his little brother, Casey, as he won the Best Actor Oscar, and had a male sober companion by his side throughout the night.  March 2017: ""Feeling Good"" After Rehab Announcement  Affleck's Tuesday announcement credited his family, namely his three children, as his motivation for seeking treatment.  ""I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step.""  ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he continued. ""This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.""  ""Ben did this for himself and his family. Family always comes first,"" a source tells ET. ""Ben has struggled with alcohol for years and it's a struggle that millions of people have to battle everyday. He has nothing to hide and wants his kids to know that he did everything he could to be a better father. That's why he announced it himself.""  ""He has completed his treatment and is feeling good,"" the source adds.    2018: Returns to Rehab  Affleck was taken to LA area facility on Wednesday, August 22 by his ex Jennifer Garner.    ""Garner was very emotional but decided to take the situation into her own hands,"" an eyewitness tells ET. Garner appeared visibly shaken. ""She looked distraught.""  On Wednesday, a separate source told ET that the actor has ""worked very hard to stay clean"" since his last stint in treatment, but there are concerns that he could be backsliding.  ""Jen [Garner] is proud of the strides he's made, but some of his friends were worried he might be taking some steps backward and could be on a slippery slope,"" the source said.""Ben wants nothing more than to get sober for his kids, for Jen and also for his career.""  The source added that Affleck ""realizes the dangers of what he could lose in life if he doesn't stick to the program, and dedicate himself to these big changes.""

1,"Courteney Cox has been reaching out to Jennifer Aniston to warn her not to fall weak and get back together with her ex Brad Pitt. Get EXCLUSIVE details!  Courteney Cox, 53, has been by her good friend Jennifer Aniston‘s side through her ups and downs and now that Jen is separated from husband Justin Theroux, 46, Courteney wants to make sure she doesn’t go back to Brad Pitt, 54. “Courteney immediately reached out to Jennifer urging her to leave Brad in the past after hearing rumors that Jen may be rekindling things with her ex,” a source close to Courteney EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Courteney was with Jen through it all with Brad and with Justin too. Through good times and the bad, Courteney has helped Jen through relationship issues over the years and she still feels very protective of her friend.”  Now that Jen is single, Courteney wants her to get a fresh start and not go back to something that already ended badly. “Courteney pressured Jen as she issued a stern warning, move forward and find someone new,” the source continued. “Courteney‘s warning made it clear to Jen that friendly conversation with Brad may be, ‘OK,’ but she better not jump back in bed with him just because she is feeling weak or is going through a tough breakup!”  Courteney’s concern for Jen may be appropriate since there’s been reports that Jen and Brad have been talking regularly ever since her split from Justin. After a highly public marriage and split, the former lovebirds are used to being in the spotlight both professionally and personally. Only time will tell whether or not they rekindle a romance but the two have seemed to stay friendly over the years. Now that time has gone by and they’re both single again, it wouldn’t surprise us if they find their way back into each other’s arms."

1,"Ben Stiller Dated Brandi Glanville  So a few months ago on her radio show, Brandi Glanville happened to mention that she dated Ben Stiller back in the '90s.  There had been speculation that he was the unnamed comedian mentioned in her book Drinking & Dating.  Will Y'All Just Leave Brandi Glanville The F*ck Alone?  She said that they dated, he made her laugh a lot and that he went on to become super famous . She didn't say they were in a full on relationship, she didn't say they were engaged and she didn't say they were even involved.  She said they dated—which indicates casual hooking up (or however you define dating these days).  LeAnn Rimes Slams Brandi Glanville For Mentioning Eddie Cibrian's Giant Penis  They both moved on, Stiller married Christine Taylor in 2000 and Brandi married Eddie Cibrian in 2001 before he cheated on her and eventually left her for LeAnn Rimes. Brandi went on to star in Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and is now an outspoken author, radio host and reality star (so amusing to think about how Eddie must wake up every day pig sick that he backed the wrong horse).  Fast forward a couple of decades and on Wednesday night, Stiller appeared on Watch What Happen's Live to promote his new movie Zoolander 2. Cheeky little Andy Cohen, who clearly had an agenda, got him to play a game of 'Plead The Fifth'.  Andy Cohen Hilariously Gets Gwyneth Paltrow To Admit Taking Hard Drugs  He could have pleaded...  Andy cut straight to it and opened with; ""We love a Real Housewives tie in on WWHL...""  Stiller knew what was coming and looked embarrassed and caught on the hop as he swiveled his chair uncomfortably.  Scroll down for the video  He eventually explained about Brandi;  ""It was fun...I wouldn't call it a relationship...it was just a couple of dates.""  Talk about trying to play it down! Brandi said exactly the same thing—she didn't say they were in a relationship, just dating and it's downright ungentlemanly of him to try to minimize it.  3inder—The Newest (and Kinkiest) Hookup App  The reason for his squirming may have had something to do with the fact that he then admitted that his wife doesn't even know he has history with the sexiest real housewife out there.  We find that kinda weird. You've been married to your wife for ever, so presumably she's pretty secure in the relationship (you would hope). When Brandi got famous and you maybe caught sight of her on TV or at an event or something, wouldn't you be like ""oh I dated that girl years ago""? Given the nature of Hollywood gossip, it's not like it would remain a secret—and neither should it, they were both single, so where's the harm?  As Andy said; ""It's going to be 'fun' watching real housewives together now!""  Real Housewives Craziest Fights, Insane Meltdowns And Brawls Ranked  Douchebags...  In fact, his response was actually a pretty crappy move by Stiller—Gerard Butler was the same when he tried to undermine the fact that he hooked up with Brandi. What, just because they are actors and she's a reality star they're embarrassed to be associated with her? They're too many rungs above her in the celebrity pecking order and shouldn't be seen to be mixing?  We can't think of any other reason why these guys feel they have to explain themselves for dating her. Seriously WTF is the problem? She's gorgeous, doesn't take herself too seriously and likes to have a good time.  If she was hot enough to date, own it, douches.

1,"Roseanne Barr net worth: Roseanne Barr is an American comedian, actress, writer, television producer, director, and politician who has a net worth of $80 million. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy before appearing in the television sitcom Roseanne (1988–1997; 2018). She won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.  Early Life: Roseanne Cherrie Barr was born to a Jewish family in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1952. She is the oldest of four children of Helen, a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome, a salesman. Her maternal grandmother was devoutly Orthodox Jewish. They got involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to fit in and hide their faith from their neighbors. When Barr was six, she began giving talks at LDS churches in Utah. She was elected president of her Mormon youth group.  When she was 16, Barr suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident. Due to the drastic change in her behavior as a result of the TBI, she was institutionalized for eight months. She had a baby when she was in the institution. She put the baby girl, Brandi Ann Brown, up for adoption. At 18, in 1970, she told her parents she was going to visit a friend in nearby Colorado for two weeks. She never returned home again.  Career: She started her career doing stand-up comedy. She appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1985. The following year, she did her stand-up routine for one of comedian Rodney Dangerfield's specials. That same year, she appeared on ""Late Night with David Letterman."" In 1987, Barr was given her own special called ""The Roseanne Barr Show,"" which aired on HBO and earned her an American Comedy Award. The success of her stand-up act led to her own series on ABC, which originally aired from 1988 to 1997 and was revived in 2018. For her work on the show, Roseanne won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy for Best Actress.  From 1998 to 2000 she hosted the talk show ""The Roseanne Show"" and in 2011 she hosted a show called ""Roseanne's Nuts."" She has also appeared in a number of feature films over the years. She starred in the 2016 documentary film ""Roseanne For President!""  In April 2017, news broke that Barr and most of the original cast of ""Roseanne"" were reuniting for an eight-episode revival of the show. ABC ended up picking up the revival which premiered in late March 2018 to high ratings. Three days later, ABC renewed Roseanne for another season. In late May, the series was canceled by the network in the aftermath of a racist tweet from Barr.  Personal Life: Barr married Bill Pentland, a motel clerk she met while in Colorado, in February 1974. They had three children: Jessica, Jennifer, and Jake. Pentland and Barr divorced in early 1990.  Four days later, on January 20, 1990, Barr married Tom Arnold. She was known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage. Barr met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis, where he opened for her stand-up comedy act. Barr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April 18, 1994.  Barr is also remembered for singing a widely panned version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds in San Diego in 1990. She sang off-key while spitting, and grabbing her crotch, apparently mimicking the actions of baseball players. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she ""bring humor to the song,"" but many criticized the episode, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition ""disgraceful.""  In 1992, Barr received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Barr is on the autism spectrum.  In November 1994, she became pregnant through in-vitro fertilization and had a son named Buck with Ben Thomas, who at one time was her personal security guard. On Valentine's Day 1995, Barr and Thomas got married. The couple divorced in 2002.  Barr elicited criticism in July 2009 when she posed as Adolf Hitler in a feature for the satirical Jewish publication Heeb magazine, called ""That Oven Feelin.'""  Barr ran for president in 2012 as part of the Green Party. Although she did not win the nomination, she went on to be nominated by the Peace and Freedom Party and came in 6th in the popular vote for President.  Roseanne and partner Johnny Argent live on a macadamia nut farm in Hawaii.  In 2020, Roseanne took to Twitter to post a video in which she said: ""You know what I think — discuss amongst yourselves if you don't agree — you don't really have to burn me at the stake for not agreeing with me — but let me just throw out one idea. And I hope that the hungry dogs in the street have enough meat as to not come after me for thinking and speaking. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being monitored and corrected and s–t, ya know, f–k it. I'll say what I'm gonna say. Trump — hear me when I say this — Trump is, in my opinion, the first woman president of the United States."" The video then abruptly ended with no explanation. It was later deleted but not before plenty of people screengrabbed the latest bizarre rant from Barr.  Salary Highlights: During the last season of her sitcom, Roseanne earned $21 million in salary.  Real Estate: When Barr and Arnold were married, they began construction on a 28,000-square-foot mansion in southeast Iowa in 1993. After their divorce in 1994 construction was halted and the half-finished mansion sat crumbling for decades. In 2018, when Roseanne the sitcom was rebooted, it was revealed that Barr and Arnold donated the 1,338-acre property to the Indian Hills Community College Foundation, which sold it to MJW Hawkeye LLC. A spokesman for the owner said that the mansion was too expensive to tear down.  In 2007, Barr purchased a 2,212-square-foot ranch-style house and 46-acre property sight unseen on the Big Island, Hawaii for $1.78 million. The property, known as Hidden Hamakua Farm, in Honokaa/Hamakua. She moved there from Los Angeles full-time in 2010. Barr's property has 2,000 macadamia nut trees, an organic garden, and a beehive."

Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift  In June, Kim revealed in a stunning GQ interview that Taylor actually knew about the “Famous” lyrics before the song was released. “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?” Kim said at the time. “[Taylor] totally gave the okay.” In the interview, Kim teases the recording of the conversation between Kanye and Taylor for the first time, revealing that a videographer who was hired to record every important Kanye moment (for a future documentary) was there for the phone call.  On a warm Sunday in July, Kim delivered her promise and posted several videos of Kanye talking to Taylor on the phone via Snapchat. Twitter reacted by throwing a #KimExposedTaylorTaylorParty.

Taylor responded with a note on Instagram, noting that she “would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.”    In September, Kim told Wonderland magazine that she’s actually a Swiftie and that “there was no shade” in leaking the phone call. She also told Billboard that she’s “so over” talking about Taylor and their feud: “I just wanted to protect my husband. I saw him getting a lot of shit … It wasn’t even about a look or anything, or to have this feud — it was like, ‘OK, here’s the truth.’ Done. Let’s all move on. I feel like I don’t want to talk about her anymore.”  WINNER: Kim, by a landslide.  3. Chrissy Teigen vs. Mom Shamers  Chrissy delivered multiple clapbacks on Twitter in 2016.

Troll recognize troll. I can’t tweet him anymore. He has fans somehow and they … they aren’t quite ‘all there,’ as they say.”    Screenshot via Daily Express  WINNER: Chrissy and John. (They’re winners every day, TBH).  5. Calvin Harris vs. Taylor Swift  Following the demise of Tayvin and the birth of Hiddleswift, Calvin’s social media activity suggested that he was anything but stoked for the new couple. In June, Calvin unfollowed Taylor on Twitter, blocked Swifties, and deleted his breakup tweet, which originally said, “The only truth here is that a relationship came to an end & what remains is a huge amount of love and respect.” He also tweeted and deleted, “Oh boy it’s about to go down,” and blocked Taylor’s brother Austin.

I won’t allow it,"" referencing Taylor's long rumored feud with Katy Perry.    Screenshot | Twitter  Things cooled down in the fall, when Calvin told British GQ that Taylor “respected” his feelings when they were together and that he’s “not good at being a celebrity.” During New York Fashion Week, Taylor shared an Instagram video of her BFF Gigi Hadid walking the Tommy Hilfiger show. “This Is What You Came For” played and Taylor sang along. According to eagle-eyed fans, Calvin liked Taylor’s video, even though he wasn’t following her at the time.  In October, Taylor performed “This Is What You Came For” for the first time at the Formula 1 Grand Prix Weekend in Austin. The show was her only show of 2016.  This content is imported from YouTube.

Calvin thanked Taylor (and Rihanna) in November after the track became the second song released this year to be certified 2x platinum in the U.K.  WINNER: It's a draw. If they’re cool, we’re cool.    6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift  In 2016 alone, the long rumored riff between Katy and Taylor had everything, from a perfume named “Mad Love” (which was possibly a wink to “Bad Blood”) to a Hillary Clinton GIF. In September, Katy told a fan that she would collaborate with Taylor “if she says sorry.”  This content is imported from Twitter.

Then Katy did this during Kanye’s famous lines in “Famous.”  WINNER: Neither, because let’s face it, this feud is never going to end.  7. Kanye West vs. Jay Z  During a ""Saint Pablo"" show in October, Kanye told the crowd that there will “never be a Watch the Throne 2” and mentioned something about “Tidal/Apple bullshit.” He also said he and Drake were the only ones who were supposed to appear on Drake’s “Pop Style,” but Jay Z joined as a “surprise.” Kanye went on to say that the Carters have not visited Kim since her Paris robbery. “You wanna know how I’m feeling? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house, like we brothers. Let’s sit down … I can’t take this shit, bro. Our kids ain’t never even played together,” Kanye said, referring to Blue Ivy, North, and Saint.  This content is imported from Twitter.

Kanye West CALLS OUT Beyoncé and Jay Z at his concert https://t.co/OCl1QD33fw — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) November 20, 2016  He continued, “Now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are just to win. Fuck winning.” Two days later, Kanye canceled the remaining 21 ""Saint Pablo"" shows and checked himself into an L.A. hospital for exhaustion. He was released Nov. 30.  Kanye’s comments tie in nicely with the long reported Kim and Beyoncé feud, which added a new (rumored) chapter in late October. Page Six reported at the time that Beyoncé has “never genuinely liked Kim” and has never been a fan of Kanye appearing on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. “[She] always gives Kanye a lot of grief whenever he’s done anything for the show,” according to a source.    WINNER: Kanye, for being ~so real~ especially after what happened to Kim. He just wanted to know why his friend wasn't there for him and his family.  8. Kanye West vs. Wiz Khalifa  Kanye nearly broke Twitter when he lashed out against Wiz in January, back when Kanye’s album The Life of Pablo was still using its working title Waves. Wiz reportedly was not happy with Kanye using the same title as rapper Max B’s work. He also tweeted (and then deleted) something about ""KK,"" which Kanye misunderstood as ""Kim Kardashian"" (see Kanye's 16th thought).  Screenshot | Twitter  Screenshot | Twitter  No one had time to read all of Kanye's tweets, which were mostly deleted that same day. But if you must know, Kanye accused Wiz of stealing “your whole shit from Cudi” (referring to Kid Cudi), used a crying Kimoji, alluded to Wiz’s “cool pants,” and went through a list of other Kanye thoughts. Kanye also referenced Amber Rose, writing “you let a stripper trap you.” Other interesting tweets include: “You own waves???? I own your child,” “You wouldn’t have a child if it wasn’t for me.”  Wiz followed up with some more tweets, including one that confirmed ""KK"" was Khalifa Kush, his very own brand of weed.

I got joints to roll @kanyewest — Wiz Khalifa (@wizkhalifa) January 27, 2016  Kanye later explained why he took down most of the tweets. #PositiveEnergy forever.  He also issued an apology on Twitter and reminded the world why it’s always a bad idea to include kids in a feud. He followed that up with confirmation that he and Wiz are cool again.    WINNER: Wiz, even though he kind of started the whole thing.    9. Kanye West vs. Amber Rose  During Kanye and Wiz’s online feud, Amber chimed in and silenced the masses with one epic tweet.

Awww @kanyewest are u mad I'm not around to play in ur asshole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch☝ — Amber Rose (@DaRealAmberRose) January 27, 2016  Two days later, Kanye tried to explain himself, claiming that he “never let them play with my ass” and that he stays away “from that area all together.”  In June, Kanye shocked the world again and released a very naked music video for “Famous,” starring wax models of Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, George W. Bush, Kim, and Amber Rose. Amber later said on her talk show that while she’s on Kanye’s side when it comes to the “Famous” feud with Taylor, she’d still very much like Kanye to “stay the fuck out of the news … so I don’t need to talk about your ass anymore.”  WINNER: Amber, for the best tweet of 2016.  10. Mariah Carey vs. Jennifer Lopez  Mariah revived her (rumored) decade-long “I Don’t Know Her” feud with J.Lo this year when Mimi told TMZ that she “still” doesn’t know her. A few days later, J.Lo told Wendy Williams, “She does say that. She’s forgetful, I guess! We’ve met many times. I don’t know … I don’t know her that well.”  This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  WINNER: Mariah, otherwise she won’t know me/you either.  11. Chloë Grace Moretz vs. The Kardashians  Kim and Khloé Kardashian have always supported each other, while Chloë has never shied away from saying (or tweeting) what’s on her mind. In March, Kim shared an old nude selfie of herself from a 2010 W magazine shoot. Black bars were included, along with the caption, “nothing to wear LOL.” Chloë was quick to respond to the naked photo and criticized Kim for setting a bad example for young women. (She was outnumbered, unfortunately, by those who publicly supported Kim, including Ariel Winter, Emily Ratajkowski, Demi Lovato, and Bella Thorne).  This content is imported from Twitter.

Kelly Ripa vs. Michael Strahan  Live With Michael and Kelly abruptly became Live With Kelly after Michael Strahan’s surprise announcement in April that he was leaving the show for Good Morning America.  This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Kelly Ripa, who Page Six said saw the move as the “ultimate betrayal,” subsequently called in sick for two consecutive days and left the show to find last-minute replacements. Kelly’s camp later confirmed that her leave of absence was actually a “pre-scheduled vacation” with her family to Turks and Caicos. From what Kelly said in her first show back to the weeks leading to Michael’s exit, the co-hosts’ final days together were anything but smooth.    This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  The network is still on the hunt for an official replacement, though Live With Kelly has included a star-studded lineup of guest hosts in recent months, including Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Megyn Kelly, Alec Baldwin, and Kelly’s husband Mark Consuelos.  WINNER: Neither. But the real loser here is ABC for not handling the announcement properly. Kelly and Michael deserved better.  13. Justin Bieber vs. Selena Gomez  The couple formerly known as Jelena spoke about each other in various magazines this year. Justin told GQ that Selena inspired a lot of songs on Purpose and that their current relationship is “cordial.” Speaking to W magazine, Selena said she is “so exhausted … I honestly am so done. I care about his health and well-being. But I can’t do it anymore.” Things got salty in August when Justin shared multiple photos of then-girlfriend Sofia Richie, which led to him lashing out at fans and threats to make his account private.  Screenshot | Instagram  Selena got into the conversation and left a comment on Justin’s account, writing, “If you can’t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol – it should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you and supported you before any one ever did.” Twitter then briefly threw a #SelenaEndedJustinParty before Selena followed up by posting photos of her own fans and liked posts that dissed Justin. She later apologized, writing on Snapchat, “What I said was selfish and pointless.” It’s unclear whether or not Justin saw that before or after he deleted his Instagram account. @justinbieber remains in “user not found” land.  In late August, Selena announced she was taking time off because of Lupus-related exhaustion, including anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. ""I want to be proactive and focus on maintaining my health and happiness and have decided that the best way forward is to take some time off,"" she said at the time.  WINNER: Justin, even though Selena turned it around by owning her mistake and dealing with her health. That, in many ways, makes her the ultimate winner.  14. Dwayne Johnson vs. Vin Diesel  After wrapping his scenes on Fast and Furious 8 in August, Dwayne Johnson got real on Instagram and lashed out at his male co-stars for behaving like “chicken shit” and “candy asses.”  This content is imported from Facebook. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  While he didn’t name anyone, all signs pointed to Vin Diesel, who shared a cryptic Instagram video days later. “Honestly, give me a second, and I will tell you everything,” he said.  This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  Page Six reported at the time that the two had been “butting heads” through production on Fast 8 and that Dwayne “lost his patience” with Vin because of his reputation for being difficult on set. “He shows up late, keeps people waiting, holds up production, and is disrespectful to people on the set.”    WINNER: The Fast and the Furious franchise, because now I want to see what The Rock’s anger and Vin’s tardiness looks like on the big screen.  15. Azealia Banks vs. Russell Crowe  In perhaps the most bizarre entertainment story of 2016, Russell Crowe and Azealia Banks both found themselves at the same Hollywood dinner party in October. Things did not go smoothly, when it was reported that the actor kicked Azealia out after she made threats. Azealia, who was a guest of RZA’s, told a different story, claiming that Russell called her the N-word, choked her, and spit on her. Fellow dinner guests stand by Russell’s side, saying that Azealia criticized his taste in “boring white men” music and threatened to stab party guests in the throat.  After promising to have the ""receipts"" on Facebook, Azealia later told Us Weekly that she was no longer pressing charges because ""I just want to put my fucking music out.""  WINNER: Neither, because it's still unclear what happened at that mysterious dinner party.  Follow Peggy on Twitter.

The American Idol judge kicked off the Asian leg of her Witness World Tour in Tokyo, Japan, on Tuesday night, and she had a very special supporter make the trip with her: on-again beau Orlando Bloom.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  During the show, the 33-year-old singer told fans while introducing her song that she “felt very loved. And this next song is about being so loved and so seen that you never ever have felt this feeling before. This feeling of love.”  She added, “This is ‘For Me You See,’ for Bubba Doo,” seeming to reveal her pet name for Bloom, whom fans spotted in the audience.  The nickname means, “One whom you adore, such as a (male) child or husband,” according to Urban Dictionary.  Bloom, 41, made no attempts to hide that he was also in Japan, sharing a selfie with the country’s famous cherry blossoms to Instagram.  “cherry blossoms bloom ❤,” he captioned the photo, tagged in Tokyo.  On his Instagram story, the actor shared more videos from his trip, including a horse rolling around in the dirt and flags blowing in the wind.  Perry and Bloom sparked rumors of a reconciliation earlier this year by vacationing together in the Maldives, then sightseeing in Prague two months later.  RELATED VIDEO: Katy Perry on How She Can Do It All: ‘[I’m] Single!’  Though the couple has yet to go public with their relationship status, a source recently told PEOPLE earlier this month that they are back together and taking it slow following their split in February 2017.  “After Orlando and Katy split, they stayed in touch. It wasn’t some awful split. They were just busy with their careers and it wasn’t working,” the source said.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

1,"A mental health (LPS) conservatorship makes one adult (called the “conservator”) responsible for a mentally ill adult (called the “conservatee”). LPS conservatorships MUST be started by a local government agency, usually a county’s Public Guardian or Public Conservator.  LPS conservatorships last for only 1 year. If they are needed longer than that, they must be restarted and the conservator must be reappointed by the court. The government agency may recommend that a family member of the conservatee be appointed as LPS conservator, but this happens usually only after the first year.    These conservatorships are only for adults who are gravely disabled as a result of a mental illness listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The most common mental illnesses are serious, biological brain disorders, like:  Schizophrenia,  Bipolar disorder (manic depression),  Schizo-affective disorder,  Clinical depression, and  Obsessive-compulsive disorder.  LPS conservatorships are not for people with organic brain disorders, brain trauma, developmental disability, alcohol or drug addiction, or dementia, unless they also have one of the serious mental illnesses listed in the DSM.        Duties and Responsibilities of an LPS Conservator  An LPS conservatorship gives legal authority to the conservator to make certain decisions for a conservatee who is unable to take care of himself or herself. If asked, the court can give an LPS conservator the duty to take care of and protect the conservatee (conservator of the person) and also the power to handle the financial matters of the conservatee (conservator of the estate).    The conservator can consent to mental health treatment even if the conservatee objects. The conservator can agree to the use of psychotropic (mind-altering) drugs. However, the conservatee may refuse to take them if he or she is determined to have enough mental ability to make this decision knowingly and with enough understanding of the consequences.    The conservator can agree to place the mentally ill person in a locked facility if a psychiatrist says it is needed and the hospital agrees to take the person, whether or not the conservatee agrees. The conservator can decide where the mentally ill person will live when he or she is not in a locked psychiatric facility.  The LPS conservator can also make financial decisions for the conservatee, like paying the bills and collecting his or her assets and income.  An LPS conservator must have enough medical and social information before making decisions for the conservatee. And the conservator must only take actions that are in the best interest of the conservatee."
1,"2014 single by Sam Smith  2014 single by Sam Smith  ""Stay with Me"" is a song by English singer Sam Smith from their debut studio album In the Lonely Hour (2014). It was released in the United States on 14 April 2014 and in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2014. ""Stay with Me"" is a gospel-inspired ballad that details the protagonist pleading with their one-night stand not to leave them.[1] The song was written by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne later receiving co-writer credits due to the song's noted melodic similarity to Petty's single ""I Won't Back Down"".  The song has become Smith's most successful single to date, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart (becoming their third chart-topper there, second as a solo artist), topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has also reached top 10 status in over twelve countries worldwide. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Darkchild's version of ""Stay with Me"" won two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[2][3]  Background [ edit ]  In an interview with NME, Smith said that the song was written in a studio in Old Street with James Napier (Jimmy Napes) and William Phillips (also known as ""Tourist"").[4] Phillips started playing with three chords on the piano, and Napier quickly provided a drum pattern, and according to Smith, ""the song just flowed out of us so naturally,"" and the song was written in 30 to 40 minutes. After finishing the song, Smith started to layer their vocals about 20 times, singing in different parts of the studio and harmonizing. The result sounded like a gospel choir, but all from Smith's own voice, and this demo was then used in the released song.[4][5]  According to Smith, ""the song is about the moment in the morning after a one night stand, where the person you are with leaves your house, and you are left by yourself, and it's just a second, where you are just like: 'I wish, I wish'. You don't even love them, you don't really fancy them that much, it's just nice to have someone in the bed next to you.""[4] The song won the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and in their acceptance speech for winning the Record of the Year, Smith said that ""I want to thank the man who this record is about who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.""[6]  On 25 March 2014, the song was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show at 7:30 pm.[7][8][9] On 29 March, they performed the song live on Saturday Night Live in the United States. On 16 May, they performed the song on The Graham Norton Show. In June, they returned to the United States as part of their tour where they performed the song on Good Morning America, at the Apollo Theater in New York with Mary J. Blige, and David Letterman.  Agreement with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne [ edit ]  In January 2015, it was revealed that a settlement had been reached with Tom Petty's publishing company to add Petty and Jeff Lynne as co-writers, and that they would receive a 12.5% songwriting credit. Petty's publisher contacted Smith's team after it noticed a likeness between ""Stay with Me"" and the melody of Petty's 1989 song ""I Won't Back Down"".[10] Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying ""All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement.""[11] According to Smith, they had never heard ""I Won't Back Down"" before they wrote ""Stay with Me"",[12][13] but they acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, and said that the likeness was ""a complete coincidence"".[14][15] Petty and Lynne, however, were not eligible for a Grammy as the Recording Academy considered ""Stay with Me"" to have been interpolated from ""I Won't Back Down"" by Napier, Phillips and Smith; instead Petty and Lynne would be given certificates to honor their contribution to the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.[16]  Composition [ edit ]  ""Stay with Me"" A 17-second sample of ""Stay with Me"" by Sam Smith, where the chorus is heard. Problems playing this file? See media help.  ""Stay with Me"" was written by Smith, James Napier, William Phillips, with additional credits to Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the key of C major in common time with a tempo of 84 beats per minute. Smith's vocals span two octaves from E 3 to E 5 while the song follows a chord progression of Am 7 –F–C.[17] According to Erine Keane of Salon, ""Stay with Me"" combines a ""contemporary drumbeat"", blue-eyed soul singing, and a refrain sung in a gospel style,[18] while Stereogum's Tom Breihan called it ""a soft-focus piano-soul ballad"".[19]  Critical reception [ edit ]  ""Stay with Me"" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Amy Davidson from Digital Spy called the song an ""emotional crescendo"" and said the chorus was ""slightly over-sentimental"" and felt that their ""soulful voice"" made the singer left in ""defeat by fleeting fling"". She gave the song four out of five stars.[20] Joe Gross from Rolling Stone gave the song a mixed review, awarding it three of five stars.[21] Isabel Pearson of Nouse gave the song a positive review during her album review, calling the song a ""euphoric, slow building love-song that's raw and undeniably one of the best tracks on this album.""[22] Sarah Milton of The Upcoming lauded the song, calling it ""electrifying with its blunt honesty and exquisite gospel influence.""[23]  In July 2014, Billboard listed ""Stay with Me"" as one of the ""10 Best Songs of 2014 (so far)"" saying that the song is ""a fragile ballad that finds its backbone when a gospel choir assists the British singer on the harrowing chorus.""[24] Variance Magazine named the song its 2014 Song of Summer.[25] The song was placed at number twelve on Rolling Stone's 50 Best Songs of 2014 list.[26] In January 2015, ""Stay with Me"" was ranked at number 15 on The Village Voice's annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll.  Commercial performance [ edit ]  In the UK Singles Chart it debuted at number 1, making it Smith's third number one. The song became the eighth best-selling song of 2014 in the UK,[27] and the seventh overall when streaming is included.[28] On the Billboard Hot 100, the song peaked at number 2 for two weeks, making it Smith's first top ten song in the US as a lead artist and their highest charting single to date. It was held off from the top spot by MAGIC!'s ""Rude."" As of the week of 2 May 2015, ""Stay with Me"" has spent 21 weeks in the top ten and 54 weeks on the Hot 100. The song was the tenth best-selling song of 2014 in the United States with 3.34 million copies sold in that year.[29] As of June 2015, The song has sold 4.1 million copies in the US.[30] In Canada, ""Stay with Me"" topped the Canadian Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks.

1,"American television personality  Regis Francis Xavier Philbin ( ; August 25, 1931 – July 24, 2020) was an American television presenter, talk show host, game show host, actor[1] and singer. Once called ""the hardest working man in show business"",[2] he held the Guinness World Record for the most hours spent on U.S. television.[3]  After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, Philbin served in the U.S. Navy and got his television start serving as a page for The Tonight Show in the 1950s. He got his first network TV exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show. He is most widely known as the co-host of the New York City-based nationally syndicated talk show Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, starting in 1988, which became Live! with Regis and Kelly in 2001, and continued as Live! with Kelly after Philbin's departure in 2011.[4]  Philbin debuted and hosted the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,[4] Million Dollar Password,[5] and the first season of America's Got Talent.[6]  Early life [ edit ]  Regis Francis Xavier Philbin[7][8][9] was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City on August 25, 1931.[10] His father, Francis ""Frank"" Philbin, was a U.S. Marine of Irish descent who served in the Pacific.[11] His mother, Filomena (""Florence""; née Bashia), was a member of an Albanian-Italian immigrant family from Greci.[9] Philbin had a Catholic upbringing.[11] He was supposedly named ""Regis"" because his father wanted him to attend his alma mater, the prestigious Regis High School.[10] It was long believed that he was an only child, but he announced on Live with Regis and Kelly in February 2007 that he had a brother named Frank (March 1, 1951 – January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier.[10][12] Philbin said his brother had asked not to be mentioned on television or in the press while still alive to protect his privacy.[13]  Philbin was raised in the Van Nest neighborhood of the Bronx.[14] He attended Our Lady of Solace grammar school[15] and graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School[7] before attending the University of Notre Dame, from which he graduated in 1953 with a degree in sociology.[12] He later served in the U.S. Navy as a supply officer Lieutenant Junior Grade (the equivalent of First Lieutenant in other U.S. military branches)[16] and then went through a few behind-the-scenes jobs in television and radio before moving into broadcasting.[12]  Career [ edit ]  Early work [ edit ]  In his earliest show business work, Philbin was a page at The Tonight Show in 1955.[17] Later he wrote for Los Angeles-based talk show host Tom Duggan and nervously filled in one night when the hard-drinking Duggan didn't show up.[18] He also was an announcer on The Tonight Show in 1962.[1] In 1957, Regis left his job as assistant news editor to Baxter Ward at KCOP, Los Angeles, to make his fortune in New York City. His replacement at KCOP was George Van Valkenburg.[citation needed]  His first talk show was The Regis Philbin Show[7] in 1961 on KOGO-TV (now KGTV) in San Diego.[19] For financial reasons, he had no writing staff, so he began each show with what became his hallmark, the ""host chat"" segment (influenced by Jack Paar), where he engaged his audience (and later his co-host) in discussions about his life and the day's events.[19] In 1964, Westinghouse Broadcasting picked up Philbin's talk show for national syndication in the late night time slot (replacing Steve Allen).[19] That Regis Philbin Show failed to attract many stations and Westinghouse replaced Philbin with Merv Griffin in 1965.  Talk shows [ edit ]  In 1964, Philbin hosted That Regis Philbin Show, a nationally syndicated show for Westinghouse Broadcasting replacing The Steve Allen Show after Steve Allen refused to renew his contract.[20] The audience did not accept Philbin as a replacement for Allen's zany antics and the appearance lasted only a little over four months because of dismal ratings, especially compared to Johnny Carson in the same time slot. Nevertheless, Philbin has cited Carson as an influence.[21]  Philbin gained his first network TV exposure in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show[19] on television (1967–1969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and he would take the barbs in stride. But his feelings were hurt when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about ""not being wanted and letting down"" the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his 1995 book, I'm Only One Man!, this was actually a publicity stunt planned by Bishop and Philbin beforehand.[22] He reiterates this assertion in his 2011 memoir, How I Got This Way, explaining that it was intended to draw in some of Johnny Carson's viewers.[23] When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to carry the night on his own.[24] A 1978 book called The Great 1960s Quiz, authored by Dan Carlinsky (pub. Harper & Row), asked, ""Who was Regis Philbin?"" (p. 7) The answer was ""Joey Bishop's sidekick on his late night show."" (p. 124)[25]  During the early 1970s, Philbin co-hosted Tempo on Los Angeles station KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV). He also commuted on weekends to St. Louis, where he filmed Regis Philbin's Saturday Night in St. Louis[26] on KMOX-TV (now KMOV).  From 1975 to 1981, he co-hosted A.M. Los Angeles, a local morning talk show on KABC-TV,[26] where Philbin was already working reviewing movies for newscasts on the station. He co-hosted first with Sarah Purcell (1975 to 1978), then with Cyndy Garvey (1978 to 1981).[26] Philbin's presence brought the show from the bottom of the local ratings to No. 1.[27]  From November 30, 1981 to April 9, 1982, Philbin and Mary Hart co-hosted ""The Regis Philbin Show,"" a national morning variety series for NBC. Philbin was hoping to transfer his success from KABC to a national network show, but the show was not successful and lasted only 18 weeks.[28] During 1982 to 1988, Philbin hosted the shows Health Styles [29] and Lifestyles with Regis Philbin [30] on the Cable Health Network and its successor, the Lifetime television network.  After Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 and moved to New York City,[26] Philbin rejoined her on The Morning Show,[26] on WABC-TV starting on April 4, 1983.[26] At the time, the 9 am time slot for WABC suffered from low Nielsen ratings because of competition from WNBC-TV's Donahue and WCBS-TV's game show block featuring The Joker's Wild and Tic Tac Dough. After Garvey left again and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford), in June 1985, and ratings improved significantly. The show became nationally syndicated on September 5, 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee[26] and the success continued. The program replaced A.M. Los Angeles upon its cancellation in 1991 and was eventually picked up by all of the ABC owned-and-operated stations except for WLS in Chicago, which aired The Oprah Winfrey Show in that time slot and had done so since the show's debut as A.M. Chicago.[citation needed]  When Gifford departed in 2000,[31] the show was temporarily named Live! with Regis.[31] Philbin had guest co-hosts until a replacement was found.[31] Philbin won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2001.[31] Kelly Ripa was chosen as the permanent co-host in February 2001, and the show was renamed Live! with Regis and Kelly.[31] Their chemistry proved to be successful as the show continued to enjoy high ratings.[32]  Philbin set a Guinness World Record for ""Most Hours on Camera"" on his August 20, 2004, Live show (replacing Hugh Downs), which gave him a total of 15,188 hours on television.[3]  Regis Philbin in 2009  In 2008, Philbin's contract with ABC was renewed through 2011.[33] Under this contract, Philbin reportedly earned more than US $21 million per annum. He received a similar contract with CBS for hosting Million Dollar Password.[33]  Philbin departed Live with Regis and Kelly after hosting his final show on November 18, 2011.[34]  Game shows [ edit ]  Philbin was also a game show host. He hosted The Neighbors, a short-lived game show on ABC from late 1975 to early 1976. The show had two female contestants guessing which of her three women neighbors said gossipy things about her.[1] In 1976, he was a ""field reporter"" for ABC's Almost Anything Goes, an American adaptation of the British game show, It's a Knockout.[35]  Philbin was the original host of the U.S. version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, an ABC game show that had its roots in Britain. Millionaire was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired Millionaire as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After Millionaire was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by Meredith Vieira. ABC brought back Millionaire in 2004 with Philbin, retitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire, a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of a special edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which started on August 9, 2009, 10th anniversary of the show.[36] He also was a celebrity contestant in this version. Millionaire, in its syndicated format, uses guest hosts for selected weeks during the season and Philbin hosted a week of episodes that aired in November 2009, coinciding with his 2009 surgery.[37]  Philbin's Millionaire hosting duties won him a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001. In a 2007 Time article, he was listed among the 15 Best Game Show Hosts in History.[38] When Millionaire was honored on GSN's Gameshow Hall of Fame special, Philbin's tenure as the show's host was praised. Leigh Hampton, then executive producer of the syndicated version, said that he ""[knew] when to take rein of it and when to sit back and let the contestant be the contestant,""[39] and Jennifer Slater of twogirlsandatv.com called him ""the sweetest man on television.""[39] Philbin himself recalled his own Millionaire tenure on said special with the following statement:[39]  You could only have a minute or two with it before the questions began. I did everything I could to make them more available for the right answer. — Regis Philbin  In November 2005, ABC announced that Philbin would host the network's revival of This Is Your Life. In August 2006, he reported that his option on the contract for the show had lapsed and he declined to renew it.[40]  Philbin hosted the first season of America's Got Talent, a Simon Cowell-produced amateur talent search show on NBC, during the summer of 2006. He flew between New York City and Los Angeles during that time period to participate in both Live with Regis and Kelly and AGT. Because of his difficulty with commuting cross country and his health problems, he was replaced in 2007 by talk show host Jerry Springer.[41] With regard to filling Philbin's spot, Springer noted that ""no one fills in for Regis. He's the best there ever was at this so you pay homage to him.""[42]  Philbin's affiliation with Fremantle started to develop at this time. He hosted a revival of the Password franchise entitled Million Dollar Password, which premiered June 1, 2008, and ended on June 14, 2009.[43]  Other television [ edit ]  On December 31, 2004, Philbin filled in for Dick Clark on ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, as Clark was recovering from a stroke. Philbin (who was a year and a half younger than Clark) lightheartedly claimed to have interrupted his previously planned vacation to do the show.[44] The following year, Philbin hosted a competing special for Fox, replacing Clark's new co-host and eventual successor Ryan Seacrest.[45]  Philbin was also the host of The Apprentice 2 finale on December 16, 2004,[46] and the official 30-minute red carpet arrivals at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008.[47]  Philbin hosted the 37th Daytime Emmy Awards on June 27, 2010.[48]  Guest appearances [ edit ]  Philbin made regular guest appearances on Late Show with David Letterman.[49] He was often introduced by Letterman as ""Regis Lee Philbin"", a play on his former morning co-host, Kathie Lee Gifford. He also appeared on other late-night talk shows; such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[50]  Philbin appeared on the sitcoms Spin City, How I Met Your Mother, Mad About You, Hope & Faith, Seinfeld, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as the sketch-comedy programs The Dana Carvey Show, Mad TV, and The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared in an episode of ""The Big Valley"" called ""The Challenge"" which first aired on March 18, 1968. In 1970, he appeared in an episode of the ABC crime drama The Silent Force.[51]  In 1991, Philbin was a celebrity guest at WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles, commenting on the main event between Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter.[52]  In 1998, Philbin made an appearance in Disney's Hercules as the voice of the mythical monster Typhon; Kathie Lee Gifford was also present as the voice of Typhon's mate, Echidna.[53]  On December 25, 2000, Philbin appeared as a panelist on the first season championship game of the ESPN game show 2 Minute Drill.[54]  On February 28, 2004, Philbin guest-starred in a Lilo & Stitch: The Series episode called ""Drowsy"".[55]  On May 15, 2006, Philbin appeared as a special guest, alongside Howie Mandel, for a two-hour special episode of Deal or No Deal on NBC.[56]  Philbin appeared three times on Celebrity Jeopardy!, the most appearances for any competing celebrity on the game show Jeopardy!. In November 2006, he won his competition and earned $50,000 for Cardinal Hayes High School, his alma mater.[57]  Philbin appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? in November 2007. He again played for his alma mater, Cardinal Hayes High School. He dropped out of the game and went home with $175,000 for the school.[58]  In September 2008, Philbin guest starred as himself on How I Met Your Mother,[59] where he joined the cast in the search for New York's best hamburger. The show revealed that he worked out at Barney's gym. During the best-burger hunt, his picture hung in the ""Best Burger"" restaurant and every other suspected best-burger restaurant, such as Corner Bistro and Veggie Heaven. In the show, he hosted a ""show within a show"" called Million Dollar Heads or Tails, which made reference to both Million Dollar Password and Millionaire.  On December 25, 2009, Philbin attended Christmas Mass with Father Edward L. Beck and Timothy Dolan, the current Archbishop of New York, at The Sunday Mass[60] and gave a special interview discussing how being a Catholic had influenced his life.[61]  In February 2011, Philbin made an appearance on Take Two with Phineas and Ferb. On July 3, 2011, he was a celebrity guest on The Marriage Ref, along with Tracy Morgan and Susie Essman.[62]  His appeared as himself in a 2020 episode of the ABC sitcom Single Parents, which was created by his daughter, J.J. Philbin.  After Live! [ edit ]  On May 29, 2012, Philbin appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight during the show's Guest Host Week. Philbin's guest was his long-time friend, fellow television host David Letterman.[63]  From September 2012 to October 2017, Philbin was an official recurring monthly co-host on Rachael Ray.[64]  On Fox Sports 1, Philbin began co-hosting Crowd Goes Wild, a daily sports panel show, on August 17, 2013. He once again partnered with his producer from Millionaire, Michael Davies.[65][66] In February 2014, he announced his leaving. He returned to occasionally host from March until its cancellation on May 8.  Philbin guest-hosted two episodes of The Late Late Show in January 2015. That July, he appeared on Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda. He reappeared on the program roughly once a month, and sometimes joined Gifford as a guest host on Hoda Kotb's days off.[67]  Writing and singing [ edit ]  Philbin's two autobiographies (with co-author Bill Zehme), I'm Only One Man! (1995) and Who Wants To Be Me? (2000), are written in the conversational or anecdotal style of his host chats. The first follows a year (1994–1995) in his life, his memories of celebrities, and work on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, among other things. The next was a response to the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. In 2011, upon leaving Live!, HarperCollins released his final memoir, How I Got This Way.[68]  Philbin was a crooner in the styles of his favorite singers: Dean Martin, Perry Como, and Frank Sinatra.[69] He tested the musical waters with his 1968 pop vocal release, It's Time For Regis![70] After receiving poor reviews, he was reluctant to record another studio album, but he occasionally sang on Live, usually duets. In 2004, he recorded When You're Smiling, a traditional pop music album.  The Regis Philbin Christmas Album was released in September 2005 by Hollywood Records.[70] It features several duets, with friend Donald Trump (""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""), Steve Tyrell (""Marshmallow World""), and wife Joy (""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" and ""Winter Wonderland"").[71] A special edition was produced, including tracks sung with the Notre Dame Glee Club.[72][73]  Personal life [ edit ]  Philbin and his wife Joy in New York City, 2009  Philbin was married to Catherine Faylen, the daughter of actor Frank Faylen, from 1955 to 1968; they had a daughter named Amy and a son named Daniel before divorcing. He married interior decorator Joy Senese in 1970; they had two daughters named Joanna and J. J. Senese occasionally co-hosted with Philbin.[citation needed] On Live, he often mentioned Joy, and to a lesser degree his children.[citation needed] He split his time between his Manhattan apartment (near the WABC-TV studios) and Greenwich, Connecticut.[10]  Philbin followed sports extensively, especially baseball and football.[74] He was an avid fan of the New York Yankees and a proud supporter of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the sports teams of his alma mater.[75] He narrated the two audio CDs that accompanied Joe Garner's book, Echoes of Notre Dame Football: Great and Memorable Moments of the Fighting Irish, and was unwilling to waver even when St. John's basketball coach Steve Lavin asked Regis to trade his allegiance.[76] After graduating from Notre Dame in 1953, he returned to campus often for football games, concerts, pep rallies, banquets, and other events, and donated $2.75 million to the university to build the Philbin Studio Theatre for performance arts productions. When he heard that Larry King had never visited Notre Dame Stadium, he invited King and insisted on giving him a tour of the ""greatest college campus in the world"", which he did in October 2002 with Tim Russert also in attendance.[77]  Philbin played on the Notre Dame tennis team, casting doubt on claims he made in an ad that he had learned to play tennis from Senese. Notre Dame football coaches such as Charlie Weis, Tyrone Willingham, and Lou Holtz have appeared on Live. Along with being a Yankees fan, Philbin was also ""keeping an eye on the Florida Marlins"".[78] On May 5, 2009, he delivered the first pitch at a Marlins game. He also supported the Pittsburgh Pirates in his final years.[79]  In March 1984, Philbin opened a Ford dealership in Gilbert, Arizona, as a side investment during his career in television. The dealership, Philbin Ford, suffered due to the already saturated auto market in the area, and was closed in late 1988.[80]  Philbin was known to have trouble handling new technology, and was frequently confused when operating electronics such as remote controls and DVD players. He did not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of Live in 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 2008. It is often noted, however, that he did not completely reject technology; he simply had Senese make calls and send emails for him.[81]  Health and death [ edit ]  Philbin had an angioplasty in 1993.[82][83] On March 14, 2007, he underwent triple bypass surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center because of plaque in his arteries.[84] Prior to the surgery, Philbin talked with David Letterman, for whom he had substituted on Late Show with David Letterman during Letterman's own quintuple bypass surgery.[84] Following Philbin's successful heart surgery, he returned to the show on April 26. On December 1, 2009, Philbin had hip replacement surgery.[85][86] He returned to his regular hosting duties on January 4, 2010.[87] In May 2010, he underwent surgery to have a blood clot removed from his calf, and returned to work the next day.[88]  Philbin died from a heart attack due to coronary artery disease on July 24, 2020,[89][90] a month before his 89th birthday,[91] at a hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut.[92] His funeral was held at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery,[93] both on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Notre Dame.[94][95][96]  Popular culture [ edit ]  Acting roles [ edit ]  Philbin was cast as car salesman Handsome Hal on Kelly Ripa's sitcom Hope & Faith.[97] He was chosen as the voice of Mabel, the sister of the Ugly Stepsister (played by Larry King), in Shrek the Third.[98] His final film was Jack and Jill.  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire [ edit ]  During the successful first run of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Philbin popularized the monochromatic look in men's formal wear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, shirt and tie coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color.[49] A Van Heusen clothing line based on this look, called Regis, was short-lived.[99]  When Philbin hosted Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he used the phrase ""Is that your final answer?"" whenever he had to confirm a contestant's answer. Adopted from the original UK host Chris Tarrant, this became Philbin's catch phrase during his tenure with the show.[100]  In August 2009, Philbin returned for a two-week stint as host of Millionaire. The eleven shows (Sunday-to-Thursday twice, plus one extra Sunday) started airing on August 9 on ABC primetime.  Philbin (along with Steve Harvey and John Henson) were named the 2009–10 guest hosts of the daily Millionaire. Philbin's episodes aired November 30 – December 4, 2009, and debuted new rules on the show.  2007 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book [ edit ]  In October 2007, Philbin was featured in the 100th anniversary issue of the Neiman Marcus Christmas Book. He was a host of the Classical Superstars Fantasy Concert, which included piano virtuoso Lola Astanova with Russia's Kirov Orchestra led by conductor Valery Gergiev. The super concert for 500 guests was offered for sale at $1.6 million.[101]  Awards and honors [ edit ]  In Morris Park, Bronx, Cruger Avenue between Sagamore Street and Bronxdale Avenue was co-named Regis Philbin Avenue.[102]  Regis Philbin's star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame  Legacy [ edit ]  The Regis Philbin Studio Theatre in the Marie P. DeBartolo Performing Arts Center was named after him. It is a 2,333-square-foot (216.7 m2) black box theater with configurable seating and staging and a system of five catwalks.[120]  Filmography [ edit ]  Discography [ edit ]  Studio albums Year Album details Peak positions US 1968 It's Time for Regis!

1,"Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.
