0,"This afternoon, an apparent ISIS supporter tweeted the above image along with the text “O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS,” and some in the right-wing media reported that the tweet constituted an advance warning about the deadly attack. The only problem: It was posted long after the shooting began.  Here’s a screencap via Rob Bettis:  Reporting of ISIS tweet is inaccurate. Tweet is time stamped 10:34 *PT* (1:34 ET). 2 hrs after the event.#CHAshooti… pic.twitter.com/KDE8o0cMj9 July 16, 2015  Twitter user @K_H_O7777777777—whose account was suspended this afternoon—published the tweet at 1:34 p.m. Eastern Time, roughly three hours after Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing at a military recruiting center this morning, killing four Marines. Nonetheless, the hysterically anti-Islam blogger Pamela Geller published a post about the hours-late “warning,” and as Mediaite notes, Fox News’ Catherine Herridge said that @K_H_O7777777777 “seemed to have foreknowledge about the shooting” on-air.  [There was a video here]  Geller and Herridge may want to take a closer look at Twitter’s time-zone function. A screencap of the tweet that’s making the rounds on right-wing Twitter does show a 10:34 a.m. timestamp, but that’s only because it was taken somewhere in the Pacific Time Zone, and Twitter displays time stamps in local time."

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist serving with Hamilton’s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment, was shot dead while guarding the National War Memorial. The gunman, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was later shot dead inside the main Parliament building.  You can watch the speeches and read the text, based in part on prepared remarks, of each of their addresses below.  Stephen Harper  PM speaks on Ottawa shooting News 6:56 Raw video from Stephen Harper 6:56  ""My fellow Canadians: for the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil.  Today our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Cpl. Cirillo was killed today — murdered in cold blood — as he provided a ceremonial honour guard at Canada's National War Memorial, that sacred place that pays tribute to those who gave their lives so that we can live in a free, democratic and safe society.  Likewise, our thoughts and prayers remain also with the family and friends of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired terrorist.  Tonight, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these despicable attacks.  Fellow Canadians, we've also been reminded today of the compassionate and courageous nature of so many Canadians -- like those private citizens and first responders who came to provide aid to Cpl. Cirillo as he fought for his life.  And, of course, the members of our security forces — in the RCMP, the City of Ottawa police and in Parliament — who came quickly and at great risk to themselves to assist those of us who were close to the attack.  Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.  We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values. on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.  But let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.  While today has been without question a difficult day, I have every confidence that Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our country through many challenges.  Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us. For now, Laureen and Ben and Rachel and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched by today's attack. May God bless them and keep our land glorious and free.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair  Opposition speaks about Ottawa shooting News 5:38 Raw video from Tom Mulcair 5:38  [The first four and a half lines of the text below are from prepared remarks that were not caught on video in the CBC broadcast above.]  ""Good evening my fellow Canadians. Today the peace of our nation's capital was shattered by an act of hatred and brutality -- cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, at the heart of who we are.  But I'm here tonight in solidarity, side-by-side with my colleagues, with our Prime Minister and with all Canadians.  This attack struck with sudden and deadly violence. It was carried out on the very ground where we come together to exchange ideas with the knowledge that whatever our differences, we will always resolve them peacefully.  It was intended to make us more fearful of our neighbours and less confident in ourselves. But it has failed. Today's events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.  And to the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces, I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and, indeed, your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.  Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone here in our nation's capital are with the family and loved ones of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Forces member from Hamilton, Ont., who lost his life this morning — the second in just a few days.  Cpl. Cirillo was literally standing on guard at a monument dedicated to the sacrifice of others who came before him. To his family and friends, I tell you that 35 million Canadians at home and abroad from coast to coast to coast and around the world stand with you tonight, and we will not forget.  In this moment, Canadians are unified in grief and stricken with disbelief. Canada is shaken today, but we shall not waver. We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow, we will do the same.  These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate. They will not. We will stand up, we will stand together. We will persevere, and we will prevail.  Good evening.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau  Liberal leader speaks about Ottawa shooting News 10:18 Raw video from Justin Trudeau 10:18  ""My fellow Canadians: I’m speaking to you from a Parliament Hill just coming out of lockdown. I am deeply saddened by today’s horrific events here in Ottawa and unreservedly condemn these brutal and heartless acts of violence. This attack is unforgivable. Should any other perpetrators or co-conspirators exist, they must be caught and be punished to the full force of our laws.  I’ve extended an offer of full support to the government along with any assistance members of our party can provide at this time. My thoughts and prayers, along with those of my colleagues, go out to the family and friends of the victims of today’s horrific shooting, including Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, who was standing dutifully, guarding one of our nation’s most sacred monuments.  It was a cowardly act — an unarmed man was murdered in cold blood, at close range. Words cannot express this deep sadness we feel over his loss. To the brave women and men who rushed to the scene to confront the shooter and to help keep us safe, I say only, 'Thank you. Thank you for your selfless courage and your professionalism in this time of crisis.'  In the days that follow, there will be questions, anger and perhaps confusion. This is natural, but we cannot let this get the better of us. Losing ourselves to fear and speculation is the intention of those who commit these heinous acts. They mean to shake us. We will remain resolved. They want us to forget ourselves. Instead, we will remember. We will remember who we are.  We are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.  Our dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.  Criminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.  Today, some speak of the loss of innocence in Canada. This is inaccurate. Canada is not and has never been innocent to the threats we face. And we know, as we have always known, that we are not immune. What is true is that we have never let those threats shape us, and we have never bowed to those who mean to undermine our values and our way of life. We have remained Canadians, and this is how we will carry on.  We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack. And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith. Continued mutual co-operation and respect will help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.  We will walk forward together, not apart.  In the coming days, we will be inundated with pictures and videos showing what happened today. But there is one in particular we should all remember: the picture in our minds we have of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians. That is who we truly are, and it is who we shall continue to be.  Good night."""

During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.  ""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""  The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week’s events.  Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.  Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.  Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board.

However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.

Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.  A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.

The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.  The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.  Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman.

0,"When contractors came in to replace the chalkboards at a high school in Oklahoma, they thought they would find a few problems in the walls. Instead, they found a hidden treasure of sorts: Chalkboards dating back almost 100 years.  ""I got goosebumps, and then I got tears in my eyes,"" said Sherry Kishore, the principal at Emerson High School in Oklahoma City. ""It was like walking into a time capsule.""  The century-old chalkboards were found underneath the current boards that were being replaced by the school to make way for more modern whiteboards.  Among the vibrantly coloured images displayed on the old chalkboards: a girl dressed in bright pink petting the tail of a turkey; cursive handwriting of the American Pledge of Allegiance; and a calendar with 1917 written above it.  The Oklahoma City Public School District believe the students were learning about pilgrims because every board has a similar lesson on them.  ""When you walk into these rooms, it's like they just left the lesson and they’re expecting to come back the next day and start again,"" Kishore said.  The district says it will preserve the lessons, so others can have the same feeling of taking a step back in time.  There's no definitive proof that the boards are from 1917 beyond the calendar written on the board.  But if they are, the chalkboards would have been installed only 28 years after the founding of Oklahoma City in 1889.  The discovery is a miracle given the city's location in the eye of Tornado Alley, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. The U.S. National Weather Service says tornadoes have hit the city more than 150 times since 1890.  Now the chalkboards that once taught history to students will be used to show the history of a time long passed for the community.  ""I think seeing this reminds them how far we've come,"" Kishore said. ""And actually [that's] what teaching is all about."""
0,"DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.  In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.  In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.  French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.  The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.  The U.S. on Friday issued a worldwide travel alert warning that terrorists could target Westerners. French authorities Friday were trying to establish whether any of the attackers had ties to extremist Islamist groups in France or abroad.  The gunman at the grocery store, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, is believed to be connected to the Kouachi brothers, authorities said. French police were hunting for a woman they say was an accomplice, Hayat Boumeddiene. Five people connected to the attackers are still being held by authorities, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.  Explosions and gunfire rang out in both places — at the printing factory in the countryside town of Dammartin-en-Goele and at the kosher market in Paris — in what the French hoped was a conclusion to the spasm of terror that has gripped France for more than two days.  One hostage was freed at the printing factory, authorities said. At the market, four hostages were killed and 15 were freed, according to Israeli government officials who spoke to their French counterparts. The four dead hostages were killed by the gunman before the police raid, Molins said. Four officers were injured, including one who was seriously hurt.  In a speech to the country, President Francois Hollande thanked the security forces for their professionalism. He said that the threat of terrorism was not over, but he said France had overcome its challenge.  ""We are free when we are not afraid,"" he said. ""We carry an idea that is bigger than ourselves, and we are able to defend it everywhere where peace is threatened.""  He cautioned against racism and called for a national march of unity on Sunday. He described the hostage siege at the kosher market as ""a terrible anti-Semitic act.""  U.S. officials have said that Said Kouachi, 34, trained with al Qaeda in Yemen several years ago, and his younger brother was convicted on a terrorism charge in 2008. They had been on the run since speeding away from the magazine’s offices after the attack on Wednesday.  The brothers were spotted Friday by police driving in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 20 miles outside the capital, at about 9:30 a.m. local time, or 3:30 a.m. ET. A gunfight broke out, and the brothers apparently holed up in the nearest building they could find, a family-owned printing business, taking a company manager hostage. Said Kouachi was shot in the throat during the gunfight, Molins said.  Yves Albarello, a French lawmaker, was quoted by the French TV station i-Tele as saying that the Kouachi brothers had told police they wanted to “die as martyrs.” The report could not be confirmed by NBC News.  Hours later came word of a second siege at the kosher market. It was not clear how many people were inside, but Thibeaut, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman, suggested there were many because it was the morning before the Jewish Sabbath, which begins Friday night.  Many ambulances were outside the market, and police asked all businesses nearby to close.  The Associated Press, citing an unnamed police official, reported that the gunman had threatened to kill hostages if police stormed the printing plant 25 miles away.  Authorities locked down schools near Dammartin-en-Goele. At one, the Lycee Charles de Gaulle, about 500 students were being kept inside.  “We are all scared,” one student, Angelina Monzili, 16, told NBC News. “We came to school expecting a normal day. We were told that the terrorists are really close. Our families are worried about us. We saw police cars flying past, and ambulances.”  People who live in the area were to told to stay away from windows, turn off lights and stay indoors. “It’s basically a war zone in Dammartin-en-Goele,” one witness told BFM TV.  Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France as the twin dramas played out.  Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport told NBC News that some aircraft coming into land had been redirected to its southern two runways, which are further away from Dammartin-en-Goele. “The town is a little bit too close to the airport,” a spokesman said.  In the tense hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, profiles began to emerge of the Kouachi brothers, who were known to French and American counterterrorism officials.  Two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News that Said Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be trained by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is considered the most violent branch of the terror network.  Cherif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to prison in 2008 after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers had been on the U.S. no-fly list “for years.”  A purported member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed in a Twitter message that the group directed the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to Flashpoint Intelligence, a global security firm and an NBC News counterterrorism consultant.  During the siege, Cherif Kouachi spoke by telephone to a French television station, saying he ""was sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda"" and had been financed by the group's leader, Anwar al-Awlaki before Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.  The final gun battle began after the brothers emerged from the printing factory and started shooting, Molins said. Security forces returned fire, killing them. Their hostage, the company manager, escaped unharmed. It later turned out that a second plant employee had been hiding under a sink, undetected during the entire ordeal.  Investigators found ammunition and heavy weapons in the factory, including a rocket launcher, Molins said.  On Thursday, elite anti-terrorist forces converged on several villages after two masked robbers with machine guns matching the Kouachi brothers' description held up a gas station in Villers-Cotteret, France.  Charlie Hebdo’s offices had been firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The publication’s chief editor — who was known as Charb — was an outspoken supporter of free speech who had reportedly been put on an al Qaeda hit list. He was among those slain.  NBC News' Alexander Smith, Nikolai Miller, Jason Cumming, Richard Engel, Robert Windrem and Pete Williams, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Nancy Ing reported from Paris.

0,"The owners of an Oregon bakery must pay $135,000 in damages for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, a state official ruled on Thursday.  Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian agreed with a preliminary ruling that Sweet Cakes by Melissa illegally discriminated against a Portland couple in 2013 by turning down their request based on their sexual orientation, The Oregonian reported.  A judge had ordered owners Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay $75,000 in damages to Rachel Bowman-Crye and another $60,000 to her wife, Laurel Bowman-Cryer.  The Kleins had argued it was against their Christians beliefs to participate in a same-sex marriage. Supporters raised money for them earlier this year after an administrative law judge imposed the penalty.  The Bowman-Cryers, through their attorney Paul Thompson, said in a statement they were glad Avakian sent ""a clear message that discrimination will simply not be tolerated in our state.""  ""This has been a terrible ordeal for our entire family. We never imagined finding ourselves caught up in a fight for social justice,"" they said.  ""We endured daily, hateful attacks on social media, received death threats and feared for our family's safety, yet our goal remained steadfast. We were determined to ensure that this kind of blatant discrimination never happened to another couple, another family, another Oregonian,"" the statement continued. ""Everyone deserves to be treated as an equal member of society.""  An email to HuffPost, the bakery said the decision was wrong, adding, ""Americans should tolerate diverse opinions, not use the government to punish fellow citizens with different views. This case has become a poster for an overpowered elected official using his position to root out thought and speech with which he personally disagrees.""  The owners vowed in a Facebook post to appeal the decision:  ""The final ruling has been made today. We have been charged with $135,000 in emotional damages, But also now Aaron has been charged with advertising. (Basically talking about not wanting to participate in a same-sex wedding) This effectively strips us of all our first amendment rights. According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. We will NOT give up this fight, and we will NOT be silenced. We stand for God's truth, God's word and freedom for ALL americans. We are here to obey God not man, and we will not conform to this world. If we were to lose everything it would be totally worth it for our Lord who gave his one and only son, Jesus, for us! God will win this fight.  The Sweet Cakes website features quotations from Biblical passages, such as, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight"" from the book of Proverbs. It also explicitly states the bakery is interested in baking for weddings between a man and a woman.  ""We here at Sweet Cakes strongly believe that when a man and woman come together to be joined as one, it is truly one of the most special days of their lives,"" the homepage said.

0,"Washington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Monday by the Obama Administration which states a new law that will take effect March 1, 2016 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.  The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.  In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.  This bill has faced extreme backlash from conservative groups as well as Republican presidential hopefuls. Donald Trump mentioned in a statement that if he is elected president he will immediately revoke this new law putting the age of consent across the country to 18 years of age."
0,"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., looks on as he walks along his tour of the National Gypsum plant Sunday, Feb. 24, 2008, in Lorain, Ohio. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)  Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support  LORAIN, Ohio (AP) — Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary.  At the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal ""would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.""  One day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words.  ""Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,"" Obama said. ""Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America — and I never have.""  ""The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,"" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland.  ""A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, ""I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,"" he said.  The trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.  Ohio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.  Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.  On another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.  Asked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.""  He also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war ""in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed"" or were sent into the war zone without enough training.  Polls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.  Given that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.  At the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.  He said Clinton has ""essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.""  On Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals ""unless they are positive for American workers.""  To an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.  ""Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,"" he said. ""But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas."""

Dr Anne Aly, an expert in homegrown terrorism at Curtin University who sits on the Council for Australian-Arab Relations, believes the gunman is indeed a lone actor, without training or support from a wider terrorist network.  ""There's a trend of lone opportunistic actors"", she told VICE News. ""We used to talk about terrorist cells, but now rather than individual cells we have lone actors taking things into their own hands. They're inspired by groups such as IS and they think they're contributing to that group.""  ""But what we've seen in the past,"" Aly continued, ""is this is how groups end.

0,"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA (BNO NEWS) — Gunmen are holding more than a dozen hostages at a cafe in Sydney’s main business area, local media reported on Monday, with local television stations airing images of hostages pressed against windows while holding a black flag with Arabic writing.  The crisis began just before 10 a.m. local time when at least two gunmen entered the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at Martin Place in Sydney’s main business area. Channel 7, which said its newsroom near the cafe had been evacuated, reported that at least thirteen hostages had been taken, including staff and customers.  Images shown by local media organizations showed hostages pressed against windows while holding up a black flag with Islamic writing, saying “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” The flag is not specifically associated with the Islamic State (ISIS) group, as was reported on social media.  New South Wales (NSW) police confirmed a major police operation was underway in the city’s main business area, and said a number of streets as well as Martin Place train station had been shut down. “Police are dealing with an armed incident and specialist officers are attempting to make contact those inside a café,” the force said in a statement.  The area surrounding the chocolate cafe was immediately evacuated after the crisis began, with heavily armed police taking positions nearby. Authorities ordered those in streets bordering Martin Place to remain indoors and away from open windows, and asked others in the area but further away to leave their buildings.  “Police urge members of the public to remain calm and note that an appropriate police presence is in place. Police urge the media to be responsible in their reporting. Speculation can cause unnecessary alarm,” the statement added, giving no further details about the incident.  Sydney’s Opera House and several other locations in Sydney were also evacuated as a precaution. Earlier reports that Sydney’s airspace had been shut down were rejected by officials, though Qantas said its planes were being diverted around Sydney’s main business area due to the incident.  “New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking in Martin Place in Sydney,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in an emailed statement. “I have spoken with NSW Premiere Mike Baird and offered him all possible Commonwealth support and assistance.”  Abbott, who offered few details about the situation, said the cabinet’s National Security Committee had convened for briefings on the situation.  “This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,” the prime minister added. “We will provide regular updates as further information becomes available.”  The siege began as Australian Federal Police (AFP) scheduled a press conference to announce the arrest of a 25-year-old Beecroft man who has been taken into custody in connection with an alleged plot to carry out a terrorist attack on Australian soil, though it was not immediately clear whether it was linked to Monday’s crisis. The press conference was canceled as news of the siege broke.  (Copyright 2014 by BNO News B.V. All rights reserved. Info: sales@bnonews.com.)"

We'll take them to aviation experts and try to get them answered.  • Transponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data.  • Police searched Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, the city's police spokesman said in televised comments. A team of five investigators went ""through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down,"" police spokesman Markus Niesczery said.  Full story:  The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, officials said Thursday.  ""We at Lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot,"" said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings.  JUST WATCHED FBI assisting in crash investigation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH FBI assisting in crash investigation 01:51  Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot, 27-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz , apparently ""wanted to destroy the aircraft.""  It's unknown whether Lubitz planned his actions, Robin said. But he ""took advantage"" of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and ""activated the descent,"" which can only be done deliberately.  Andreas Lubitz  New details released Thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course.  Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data.  The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds. The captain, somehow locked out of the cockpit, can be heard banging on the door, Robin said.  And screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight.  For those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains, Robin said, death was instantaneous.  No clues about why co-pilot would crash plane  Police searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive.  A search is underway for the plane's second ""black box,"" the flight data recorder, which could shed more light on the plane's final minutes.  And the French government has asked the FBI to help investigate the crash, a law enforcement official said.  Investigators so far say they're baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane  Lufthansa does ""not have any clues,"" Spohr said.  The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder.  JUST WATCHED Lufthansa CEO: Speechless that co-pilot crashed plane Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lufthansa CEO: Speechless that co-pilot crashed plane 01:08  The pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight, Robin said. When the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom, he asked Lubitz to take over.  It's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned, or whether Lubitz ""put the lever on lock,"" which would have prevented the code from working, Spohr said.  The most plausible explanation of what happened next is that Lubitz, ""through deliberate abstention, refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot, and used the button"" to cause the plane to lose altitude, Robin said.  The disaster is not being described as a ""terrorist attack,"" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a ""suicide"" either, Robin said. Spohr agreed: ""If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide,"" he said.  Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known, Robin said.  Lufthansa has no standard psychological testing after hiring  He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the company said. Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen, Germany.  He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying, but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone, the prosecutor said.  He had passed medical tests, Spohr said . The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady, with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue.  Lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired, Spohr said. The company considers an applicant's psychological state when hiring, he said.  The co-pilot was ""fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own,"" Robin said.  A man in Montabaur, Germany, who belonged to the same flight club as Lubitz, said he couldn't believe it. ""The way I know Andreas, this is inconceivable,"" Peter Ruecker said.  Village opens homes to victims' loved ones  Relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished.  Seyne-les-Alpes, a nearby town, is serving as a staging post. Mayor Francis Hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area Thursday.  Most are not expected to stay overnight, he said. But in case they do, he said, local residents have offered accommodations for them.  Lufthansa is providing ""financial support"" to relatives of the victims, Spohr said. He declined to go into details.  The families of the two pilots are also in France, Robin said, but they are not in the same place as the passengers' relatives.  The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks, he said.  While some human remains have been recovered, many have not. The task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather. Workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety.  The mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access.  Victims from 18 countries  The doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday.  Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for about eight minutes.  The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of about 6,000 feet. Then it crashed.  The 144 passengers and six crew members came from 18 countries . About half were from Germany, and 35 were from Spain."

0,"One of the main questions is why the pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers as the plane began its unusual descent, which suggested that the pilots or the plane’s automated systems may have been trying to maintain control of the aircraft as it lost altitude.  Among the theories that have been put forward by air safety analysts not involved in the investigation is the possibility that a pilot was incapacitated by a sudden event such as a fire or a drop in cabin pressure.  A senior French official involved in the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the lack of communication from the pilots during the plane’s descent was disturbing, and that the possibility that their silence was deliberate could not be ruled out.  “I don’t like it,” said the French official, who cautioned that his initial analysis was based on the very limited information currently available. “To me, it seems very weird: this very long descent at normal speed without any communications, though the weather was absolutely clear.”  Image The French aviation authorities have recovered an audio file from the cockpit voice recorder, but did not say whether it was partial or complete. Credit... Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses, via Associated Press  “So far, we don’t have any evidence that points clearly to a technical explanation,” the official said. “So we have to consider the possibility of deliberate human responsibility.”  Mr. Jouty said it was far too early in the investigation to speculate about possible causes.  “At this moment, I have no beginning of a scenario,” Mr. Jouty said. However, he said there was not yet any evidence available that would support a theory of a depressurization or of a midair explosion.  Speaking on the French radio station RTL, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday morning that terrorism was not a likely “hypothesis at the moment,” but that no theories had been excluded. He said the size of the area over which debris was scattered suggested that the aircraft had not exploded in the air but rather had disintegrated on impact.  Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, has characterized the crash as an accident. The airline has not disclosed the identities of the pilots, except to say that the captain was a 10-year veteran with more than 6,000 hours of flying time in A320s.  Image French emergency services resumed work on Wednesday near the crash site of a Germanwings jet. Credit... Peter Kneffel/European Pressphoto Agency  The French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses, which is leading the technical inquiry into the crash, sent seven investigators to the crash site Tuesday. They have been joined by their counterparts from Germany, as well as by technical advisers from Airbus and CFM International, the manufacturer of the plane’s engines.  Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Jean-Paul Troadec, a former director of the French air accident investigation bureau, said one of the big challenges for investigators would be to protect the debris at the crash site from inadvertent damage.  “We need to ensure that all the evidence is well preserved,” Mr. Troadec said, referring to the pieces of the plane littered across the steep slopes as well as to the remains of the victims. The identification of the victims will probably require matching DNA from the remains with samples from relatives.  The recovery effort will be a laborious task, given the state of the wreckage, the difficult terrain and the fact that the crash site is so remote that it can be reached only by helicopter.  Cabin depressurization, one of the possibilities speculated about on Wednesday, has occurred before, perhaps most notably in the crash of a Cypriot passenger plane in 2005 that killed all 121 people on board as it approached Athens. In that case, Helios Airways Flight 522, a slow loss of pressure rendered both pilots and all the passengers on the Boeing 737 jet unconscious for more than three-quarters of an hour before the aircraft ran out of fuel and slammed into a wooded gorge near Athens, the Greek capital.  Investigators eventually determined that the primary cause of that crash was a series of human errors, including deficient maintenance checks on the ground and a failure by the pilots to heed emergency warning signals."

It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.  And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.  ""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""  Parts of France on high alert  This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.  They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous.

Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.  Ties to Islamist extremists  As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.  Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.  Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.  Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.  Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.  His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""  ""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""  Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.  A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.  Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.  Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.  The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

0,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Terrifying letters forced a New Jersey family to flee their new home, and what happened left residents in the quiet community more than a little unnerved.  As CBS2’s Valerie Castro reported, the large six-bedroom home in Union County is being watched – according to a lawsuit filed by its new owners.  They paid $1.3 million for their “dream home” in the picturesque town of Westfield. They claim the previous owners were aware of a man who calls himself “the Watcher,” but they never said anything.  “I would be pretty upset if I bought a house and found out that the previous owners knew about it,” said Robert Hagen of Westfield.  Since moving in, the owners said they have received numerous letters from the mysterious person. “The Watcher” claimed the home “has been the subject of my family for decades,” and “I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming,” Castro reported.  The new owners have several children, and other letters asked, “Have they found out what’s in the walls yet?” and “I am pleased to know your names now, and the name of the young blood you have brought to me,” Castro reported.  The bone-chilling letters were enough to send the new family packing. The incident was so unnerving that Westfield Mayor Andy Skibitsky addressed the issue at a Town Council meeting Tuesday night.  “Our police department conducted an exhaustive investigation based on the factual circumstances and evidence available,” Skibitsky said.  No charges have been filed in the case. Whether the owners have any legal case remains to be seen, Castro reported.  The mayor said under New Jersey law, the letters are classified as a disorderly person’s crime. Anyone who might have new information about the letters is asked to call Westfield police."

0,"BERLIN -- A Swiss museum accepted a massive, priceless trove of long-hidden art from the late German collector Cornelius Gurlitt on Monday, promising to work with Germany to make sure that any Nazi-looted pieces in it are returned to Jewish heirs.  Three works in the collection donated to Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern will be returned immediately because they have already been identified as looted art, German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said at a joint news conference with the museum. The pieces are by Henri Matisse, Max Liebermann and Carl Spitzweg.  Germany, meanwhile, published online the business ledgers of Gurlitt's father Hildebrand, an art dealer who had worked closely with the Nazi regime. Many potential heirs and art experts had demanded the move to help their searches for possible looted art. The ledgers covered the years from 1937-45, detailing in neat fountain pen the purchases and sales of various paintings.  Monday's press conference was the latest twist in a saga that has captivated the art world.  In 2012, German authorities seized 1,280 pieces of art from Cornelius Gurlitt's Munich apartment while investigating a tax case, including works by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. The development shocked the art world, since many of the works had not been seen for decades and experts feared they had been lost or destroyed.  Gurlitt said he had inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered ""degenerate"" to buyers outside of Germany for cash. Some of the works -- including Impressionist and modern masterpieces -- had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell.  Gurlitt died in May at age 81, designating Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern as his sole heir.  A special German government task force that was already looking into the provenance of the Gurlitt art will now work closely with the Kunstmuseum Bern to return any looted art as quickly as possible, Gruetters said. The agency is checking about 240 art works in the Munich trove that may have been looted by the Nazis.  ""As part of our special German responsibility toward the victims of the Nazi dictatorship, we want to ensure justice is done not only in the legal framing of the agreement, but also morally,"" Gruetters said.  In addition to art in Munich, more than 200 artworks were found at Gurlitt's house in Salzburg, Austria. Details on the Salzburg art have been scarce -- it's not even clear where the art is now stored. Gruetters said it will be checked to see if it, too, contains Nazi-looted art.  One of Gurlitt's cousins has filed a claim on the collection, which a Munich court said would have to be sorted out before the art goes anywhere. The court has given no indication of how long that could take.  Kunstmuseum Bern's board president, Christoph Schaeublin, told reporters the decision to accept the collection came only after long, difficult deliberations to figure out how the museum could carry out the responsibilities that came with the bequest.  Julius Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish scholar who believes art stolen from his family may be among the Gurlitt collection, told The Associated Press he welcomed Germany's move to put Hildebrand Gurlitt's account books online. But Schoeps said the new agreement seems to make it even more complicated for possible heirs to retrieve their property.  ""They didn't say a word about who we can turn to for help,"" said Schoeps. ""More and more institutions are getting involved in this -- the German government task force, the Bern museum, the Lost Art Database in Magdeburg -- I find this very irritating.""  Greg Schneider, executive vice-president of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said so far the work of the German task force on looted art has been too opaque. He urged that the agency make both its deliberations and its findings public.  ""The major aspects of the agreement are quite positive, the key will be the implementation,"" Schneider said in a telephone interview from New York. ""This promises lifting the veil of secrecy, so we'll have to see."""
0,"A t least twelve people were killed when Islamist gunmen carried out a “massacre” inside the Paris offices of a satirical magazine today.  Hooded attackers armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles stormed the offices of the notoriously anti-Islamic weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo this morning.

Ten people in total were reported to be wounded, including five critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police who attended the scene.  Emergency workers administer treatment to victims at the scene  Eye witnesses reported seeing hooded men dressed in black entering the newspaper’s headquarters before firing Kalashnikovs.  One employee contacted by phone as the attack was going on said : “It’s a massacre. There are dead! “ before the call was disconnected.  French TV channel Europe 1 reported witnesses saying the black hooded men, who carried out the attack shouted out “Allah Akbar” and “The Prophet has been avenged”.  There were reports that two police officers were among the dead.

My thoughts are with the victims, their families and their colleagues. — Nick Clegg (@nick_clegg) January 7, 2015  The offices were firebombed in 2011 after publishing an image of Mohammed and today’s attack came after it publicised a controversial novel entitled Submission by French author Michel Houellebecq which talks of France turning into an Islamic state by 2022.  The magazine featured the author and a reference to Ramadan on its front page published yesterday.  The atrocity is the latest in a series of Islamist linked attacks in France.  Police and ambulances at the scene of the attack  President Hollande was on the scene today, saying the worst terrorist atrocity in recent years this century was an unjustifiable attack on press freedom.  He called the shooting a “cowardly assassination” and a “barbaric act against journalists who wanted to defend their ideas”  He added: “I will convene emergency cabinet meeting today to protect all areas where similar acts can be committed.”  First pics of Charlie Hebdo massacre gumen shooting at police - they got away, heading towards eastern Paris. pic.twitter.com/z2dM3ZUR7k — Peter Allen (@peterallenparis) January 7, 2015  He said it was “no doubt this is a terrorist attack”, adding: “We must show national unity and strength.  “France is moved by this attack because we are a freedom-loving nation.”  Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the attack saying: “The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.”  An injured man is taken away from the scene on a stretcher  The offices of the same magazine were burnt down in a petrol attack in 2011 after running a magazine cover of the Prophet Mohammed as a cartoon character.  At the time, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephane Charbonnier, said Islam could not be excluded from freedom of the press.  He said: ‘If we can poke fun at everything in France, if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism, that is annoying.’  France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve (C, L) and Paris' Mayor Anne Hidalgo (C, R) arrive at the headquarters in the wake of the shooting  Mr Charbonnier, also known as Charb, said he did not see the attack on the magazine as the work of French Muslims, but of what he called ‘idiot extremists’  The cover showed Mohammad saying: “100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter”.  A crashed police car after a gunfight broke out near the magazine HQ  Inside, there was an editorial, attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, and more cartoons - one showing the Prophet with a clown’s red nose.  Depiction of the Prophet is strictly prohibited in Islam, but the magazine denied it was trying to be provocative.  Benoit Bringer, a journalist with Agence Premiere Ligne - who saw the attack, told the iTele network he saw several masked men armed with machine guns.  He said two officers arrived on bicycles, then - apparently unarmed - they left."
0,"to have been onboard  Advertisement  A number of British nationals are likely to be among the 150 people killed when Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and ploughed into a remote region of the French Alps, the Foreign Secretary said tonight.  The announcement from Philip Hammond came just hours after the first pictures emerged of those who died when the Airbus A320 crashed during the 90-minute flight from Spain to Germany.  Among the dead were 16 German schoolchildren, six crew and an opera singer who was travelling with her baby. Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio, a 37-year-old Spanish woman living in Manchester, and her seven-month-old son, Julian, also died.  Two Australian nationals, a mother and son, are among the confirmed victims. There were early reports that an American passenger was on board but this has not been confirmed.  Scroll down for videos  Victims: Opera singers Maria Radner (left), who was travelling with her baby, and Oleg Bryjak (right) were among the passengers who lost their lives in the crash. It is also likely that a number of British nationals were among those who died, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said  Australian victims: Mother and son Carol and Greig Friday, from Victoria, were among the 150 passengers and crew on board doomed Germanwings Flight 4U 9525  Crash site: Pieces of debris, including what appear to be parts of the aircraft's tail fin and a wheel, are seen strewn on the mountainside  Wreckage: The registration of the aircraft, which features a German flag, was one of the larger pieces of debris photographed at the crash site  President Barack Obama expressed his condolences over the 'awful' crash which he called 'particularly heartbreaking' as so many of the plane's passengers were young.  A further two Japanese citizens were also believed to have been on board the doomed plane, Tokyo said.  German reports suggest the aircraft had been grounded just 24 hours before it departed Barcelona for Dusseldorf. The plane had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem.  The revelation will put pressure on owner Germanwings to explain why the plane was allowed to fly. Urgent safety checks are now being carried out on other A320s, which are popular with budget airlines.  Meanwhile, passengers were left stranded at Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester after several Germanwings crews - including pilots - refused to work following the accident yesterday over safety fears.  Experts said Flight 4U 9525's rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky – prompting speculation that the pilots may have suddenly fallen unconscious. As the French authorities appeared to rule out terrorism, it also emerged that:  Five years ago two pilots from the same Germanwings airline nearly passed on landing in Cologne. Contaminated air was suspected;  It is the third serious incident involving the Airbus 'family' in six months – two of them fatal crashes that have left more than 300 dead;  A safety warning was issued last November after a sister plane of Flight 4U 9525 went into a dive over Spain, falling at 4,000ft a minute before the pilot regained control.  Disaster: A rescue helicopter flies over wreckage of a Germanwings Airbus A320 plane that crashed between the towns of Barcelonnette and Digne in the French Alps. All 150 people on board - including two babies and 16 children from the same German school - died in the crash  Destruction: The distinctive colours of the Germanwings plane are seen in this close-up photo of the destroyed rudder of the aircraft  Obliterated: Debris reportedly from the Airbus A320 is seen on the mountainside. Mystery surrounds the final moments of the plassenger plane after air traffic controllers claimed they received no SOS signal despite the jet nosediving 32,000ft in just eight minutes  Destroyed: Crews in the first helicopter to reach the site said they had seen no survivors and reported finding chunks of plane the size of a car  About 150 firefighters and mountain police were deployed to the scene, although officials warn it could take days to retrieve any bodies  Windows from the Airbus A320, a model of plane known as the 'workhorse of the skies', are clearly visible on this piece of debris  Photographs taken of the scene this evening show what appears to be sections of charred aircraft on the mountainside  All 142 passengers, two babies and six crew died on the morning flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, in Germany's Ruhr region.  The German pupils, from the small town of Haltern, were with two teachers. Others who were on board the flight included a 37-year-old Spanish woman who lives in Manchester – whose child also died – and the Spanish opera star Maria Radner, who was with her child.  Mother and son Carol and Greig Friday from Victoria were confirmed as the two Australian victims of the French Alps plane disaster.  The family of the pair released a statement on Wednesday, which said: 'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams.'  Last night one of the black box flight recorders that could hold the key to what happened had been recovered as more than 500 members of search and rescue teams worked to reach the remote site of the disaster above the small village of Barcelonette in the Massif des Trois Evêchés.  Pictures of the crash site showed debris - with no pieces larger than a small car - and wreckage scattered on the bare, bleak mountainside over an area said to be more than a mile square.  Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister, described the site as a 'picture of horror' while Christophe Castaner, deputy of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region where the jet crashed, tweeted: 'Horrible images in this mountain landscape. There is nothing left, but debris and bodies.'  Such was the disintegration of the 24-year-old jet yesterday that little appeared recognisable apart from a section containing several windows.  Images of the crash site emerged yesterday as confusion reigned over the final minutes of the doomed Airbus A320 after air traffic controllers claimed they received no SOS despite the jet nosediving 32,000ft in just eight minutes.  Part of the writing on the fuselage of the plane is visible on a piece of the wreckage (centre) on the mountainside  Four members of the search team are seen making their way to the crash site. The operation has now been called off for the night  Views of the crash site show a handful of rescue workers starting their work among pieces of debris scattered across the mountainside  Charred pieces of wreckage continue to burn on the mountainside alongside smaller pieces of debris  Parts of the plane, none larger than a small car, are pictured on the side of the mountain where the Airbus A320 crashed yesterday  Earlier reports quoted aviation sources in France as saying the pilots issued a Mayday distress signal and requested an emergency descent minutes before it hit the ground. However, civil aviation authorities later denied that air traffic controllers received any such call.  'The aircraft did not itself make a distress call, but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,' a spokesman for the French civil aviation authority said.  One local spoke of hearing an explosion 'like dynamite' while another said he had seen the plane flying far too low. Sebastien Giroux said: 'There was no smoke or particular sound or sign of anything wrong, but at the altitude it was flying it was clearly not going to make it over the mountains.  'I didn't see anything wrong with the plane, but it was too low. I didn't see much, perhaps for two or three seconds … it seemed it was going down.'  Gilbert Sauvan, a local council spokesman, said the plane disintegrated on impact, leaving the 'largest piece of wreckage the size of a car.'  The weather was calm at the time of the accident with the sky completely clear, with almost no wind.  Bookshop owner Dominique Casson, 38, said: 'I heard a loud bang and then saw just smoke and flames at the top of the hillside.  'The plane came down so quickly there was no notice at all. There could have been even more loss of life if it came down in a more populated area.'  Bruce Robin, a prosecutor from Marseille, said: 'The body of the plane is in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage.'  Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said the aircraft began descending again shortly after it reached its cruising height of 38,000ft, having taken off from Barcelona at about 10am local time.  It started losing altitude at around 10.33am with the speed reportedly increasing to 548mph. The last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending to 6,800 feet at 434mph – eight minutes later – at 10.41am.  Scattered: Images from the first rescue helicopters to reach the remote crash site shows wreckage spread across hundreds of metres  Vast wilderness: An aerial view of the area in the French Alps where the Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed, between Barcelonette and Digne  A rescue helicopter flies over pieces of debris. The search operation has been called off for tonight as is expected to resume tomorrow  Mr Winkelmann said the captain was experienced and had been with the Germanwings' parent company Lufthansa for more than ten years, having clocked up 6,000 flying hours.  The plane, he said, had had a normal service at Dusseldorf on Monday and its last major check-up had been in the summer of 2013. It flew regularly to London and was there last Sunday.  Passengers reported seeing several Germanwings planes still stuck on the tarmac at Dusseldorf yesterday hours after they should have departed.  Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Tuesday evening that he understood the crew members' sentiments.  'One must not forget: many of our Germanwings crews have known crew members who were onboard the crashed plane,' Spohr said.  'It is now more important to ensure psychological assistance if needed. And we will get back to a full flight operation as soon as possible then. But for me, this is rather secondary now,' he added. Yesterday, Heike Birlenbach, the airline's vice president told reporters: 'we say it is an accident'.  Aviation expert Chris Yates told MailOnline it was difficult to explain why the pilots would not send an emergency call.  'Air crash investigators will need to examine the black boxes, the flight data recorder and the voice recorder to determine exactly what happened,' he said. 'It is possible that the pilots sent a distress signal that was not received by air traffic control.'  Around 100 of the dead are German. Two Australians, and one person each from the Netherlands, Turkey, and Denmark were among the victims, according to their respective governments. Another 45 victims are Spanish and relatives were bussed to hotels near Barcelona's El Prat airport.  The Mexican government said there were indications that one Mexican national was also among the victims.  Two leading opera singers, German-born Maria Radner and Oleg Bryjak from Kazakhstan, were among those who lost their lives in the crash.  Ms Radner, who performed all over the world including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and theatres in Milan and Buenos Aires, was on the plane with her husband and baby. She had just finished performing alongside Mr Bryjak in the Richard Wagner opera Siegfried at Barcelona's Liceu.

We are stunned.' He added that the theatre's employees will hold two minutes of silence on Wednesday in the singers' honor.  Spanish national Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio, from the city of Jaca in Huesca, and her seven-month-old baby were also named as passengers. Local media reported the 37-year-old lived in Manchester but had returned to Spain for her uncle's funeral. It is not known whether her husband was with her.  Sources close to the Spaniard said she had decided to return via Germany after being unable to get a direct flight.  Two Australians were among those who died. They were a Victorian mother and her adult son, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. Officials are now seeking to confirm whether there were any other Australians or dual citizens on board.  A schoolgirl, her mother and grandmother, and an unnamed father of four, are also understood to have died in the crash.  The Foreign Office has set up a helpline for anyone concerned about a friend or family member who may have been on board.  In a statement released tonight, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the crash as a 'tragic incident' and sent his condolences to those who have lost family or friends.  He said: 'I don't want to speculate on numbers of British nationals involved until we have completed our checks on all the passenger information.  'However, based on the information available to us, it is sadly likely that there were some British nationals on board the flight. We are providing consular assistance and will give further help as more information becomes available.'  French emergency services workers and members of the French gendarmerie gather in Seyne, south-eastern France near the site where a Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed in the French Alps  French firefighters prepare to take-off from Digne-les-Bains for the site where the Airbus A320 crashed  He added Britain was working closely with the French, German and Spanish authorities, and the airline to establish the facts surrounding the crash.  President Barack Obama expressed his condolences and said America stood by their allies in this 'moment of sorrow.'  'Our thoughts and prayers are with our friends in Europe, especially the people of Germany and Spain,' he said ahead of a joint press conference with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan at the White House.  'I called German Chancellor (Angela) Merkel and I hope to speak with President Rajoy of Spain later today to express condolences of the American people, and to offer whatever assistance that we can as they investigate the awful tragedy.  'It's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children.'  The search of the plane crash site was called off for the night after conditions became too difficult and will resume tomorrow morning, French authorities said. Ten French police officers will guard the site overnight.  It is France's first air crash since Concorde crashed minutes after take-off from Charles de Gaulle airport in 2000, killing 113 people.  Yesterday, debris from the jet was found scattered over a wide area near Barcelonnette in an inhospitable region of the Alps.  One witness, a local farmer named only as Jean-Christophe led rescuers to the scene. He told French radio: 'The plane smacked straight into the wall of the mountain and just blew up completely.  'I saw smoke, bits of plane, none very big. Everything has exploded and sprayed over the scene. There is really nothing left. Given the impact I cannot imagine the bodies are whole.'  French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve (centre) is sheltered from the rain upon his arrival in Seyne, close to the crash site  'It is possible that the pilots sent a distress signal that was not received by Air Traffic Control. A thorough examination of the recorders will help provide a precise sequence of events.'  Grieving families, including those of the 16 schoolchildren killed in the crash, gathered at Dusseldorf airport in Germany yesterday, where the jet was due to land, to await news of the rescue and recovery operation.  French president Francois Hollande said he did not expect there to be any survivors.  He said: 'It's a loss, a tragedy which has happened on our soil. I am seeking information about homes in the area it came down. It's difficult place to access. In the meantime solidarity must prevail.' He said he believes most of the passengers were German, Spanish and Turkish.  Speaking last night, President Obama said his thoughts were with the families of those killed in the crash. He added that he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and planned to call Spanish President Mariano Rajoy later in the day.  The White House and the airline chief said there was no sign that terrorism was involved, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged reporters not to speculate on the cause.  Shock: A man who appears to have been waiting for missing Flight 4U 9525 reacts at Dusseldorf airport where the Airbus A320 was due to land  Grief: People waiting for Flight 4U 9525 are led away by staff at the airport in Dusseldorf  People waiting for flight 4U 9525 console each other as news of the crash filters through at Dusseldorf airport  Relatives of the plane crash passengers are seen leaving Terminal 2 of Barcelona El Prat airport, where the plane took off yesterday  'We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash,' she said in Berlin. 'All that will be investigated thoroughly.' Mrs Merkel, Mr Hollande and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy were to visit the site on Wednesday.  According to flight data from FlightAware 24, the aircraft was cruising at 38,000 feet at 532mph at 9.30am local time (10.30am GMT). It started losing altitude to 37,975 by 10.31am with the speed reportedly increasing to 548mph.  But 10.41am, the last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending to 6,800 feet at 434mph. The aircraft took around ten minutes to drop 31,200 feet.  The cause of the crash was not immediately known, with weather conditions described as good in the region and the airliner flying at an altitude high above the Alps.  The area is inaccessible for vehicles but helicopters are able to deposit vehicles at the site.  About 150 firefighters and high mountain police were deployed to the scene, including 40 officers from Grimp – a unit within the Fire Service that specializes in rescue operations in dangerous and inhospitable environments.  Fifty vehicles, including 4x4s, quads and ambulances, are also being deployed. Dog teams will also investigate at the scene.  AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION: WHAT HAPPENED TO FLIGHT 4U9525? RAPID DECOMPRESSION? Flight 4U9525 was at 38,000 for three minutes before it began its descent. If the cabin lost pressure the flight crew is trained to immediately don their emergency masks before doing anything else. Once secured, the pilots begin an emergency descent to bring the aircraft under 14,000 feet. SLOW DECOMPRESSION? If the aircraft failed to pressurise properly, the pilots could have been suffering from a lack of oxygen. Pilots are trained to recognise the signs of hypoxia and act accordingly. However, with Helios Flight 522, the pilots failed to act in time and are believed to have died of oxygen deprivation before the jet eventually ran out of fuel. TERRORISM? Experts have almost ruled out a terrorist bomb as an explosion at high altitude would spread debris over a large area such as the Lockerbie disaster. Initial searches of the scene suggest the debris field is very localised. MECHANICAL / COMPUTER FAILURE? Air crash investigators will search for the black boxes containing the flight data recorder which measures information about the speed, altitude and the aircraft's various computer settings. The European Air Safety Agency recently issued a safety directive for all Airbus A318-A321s after a Lufthansa jet went into an uncontrolled dive in November 2014. They will also look for the cockpit voice recorder. This is a crucial piece of evidence as it will tell investigators what was happening in the run up to the disaster and what efforts they made, if any, to save the jet. PILOT ERROR? The black boxes will help determine if the pilots were at fault for what happened. Did they deal with the emergency in the appropriate fashion. MILITARY INCIDENT? Some experts claim that an Italian military jet switched its transponder to the emergency code of #7700 at 10.35, near where flight 4U9525 began its final descent. Investigators should be quickly able to determine whether this emergency was a coincidence or possibly had some relevance to the passenger jet's demise.

The students - all of whom are understood to be in their teens - were pupils at the English-speaking Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Haltern-am-See, not far from the city of Dusseldorf. The Year 10 pupils were returning home from a week-long exchange programme in Barcelona at the time of the disaster, which took place in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany. This afternoon it emerged that the pupils almost missed the doomed flight when one of the students left her passport behind. But in a tragic twist her host family offered to race the girl and all her travel documents to the airport directly, allowing them to make the flight in time. As darkness fell in over Haltern am See, mourners gathered outside Joseph-Koenig school to pay tribute to the victims of the crash Mourners gathered at a memorial of flowers and candles outside the college where the teenagers, all in year 10, were pupils Tragic: In emotional scenes in Haltern-am-See this afternoon, schoolmates of those killed in the disaster were seen comforting one another and embracing and they laid flowers at the school gates School children mourn for their dead school mates in front of the Joseph-Koenig Gymnasium this afternoon Grief: Pupils mourn in front of the Joseph-Koenig college in Haltern am See this afternoon In emotional scenes in Haltern-am-See this afternoon, schoolmates of those killed in the disaster were seen comforting one another and embracing and they laid flowers at the school gates. One note, written in memory of a girl called Kati, read: 'Gone, but not forgotten, lost but always with us. Our hearts are broken but you are forever in them'. One school, pupil called Ibrahim told local TV; 'I lost a good friend on that plane, 15 years old, a beautiful girl with everything ahead of her. We are in bits here. We cannot take it in.' In a press conference this afternoon the school confirmed that all the students boarded the plane together, adding: 'This is without doubt the bleakest day in the history of our town.' At a press conference this afternoon, mayor of Haltern am See, Bodo Klimpel, said employees had spoken with officials in Barcelona who confirmed that all 16 students and two teachers had boarded the plane together. 'The 16 students affected were from a Spanish course in Year 10. They took part in a student exchange in Spain and were flying back this afternoon,' he said, adding that a coach had been waiting at Dusseldorf airport to pick the students up.

Earlier there were rumours that several of the students had missed the flight after one of them forgot her passport but hopes were subsequently dashed by Marti Pujol - the mayor of the village of Llinars del Valles where the children had been staying. The mayor revealed that the young girl had realised she left her passport behind after arriving at the train station with the rest of her companions to catch a train to Barcelona's El Prat airport Children at the Giola Secondary School, where the exchange students were on exchange, spoke of their sorrow after hearing the news. One, Anna Garcia, said: 'One of the German girls left a bag with all her travel documents inside at her host family's home... So they didn't hold the rest of the group up, the family took her to the airport and she was able to board the plane.' The director of Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Germany said that once it became clear that the plane was not going to land at Dusseldorf, lessons at the school were immediately cancelled. By this afternoon friends and relatives of the dead had taken to social media sites to express their sadness at their deaths. Students attend a mass in Llinars del Valles, the Spanish town near Barcelona where the German exchange pupils attended school Advertisement  It emerged yesterday that a safety warning was issued last year when a sister plane of the one involved in yesterday's disaster suddenly lost altitude.  The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after an Airbus A321 went into an uncontrollable dive north of Pamplona, Spain before pulling out.  According to the safety warning, the Lufthansa jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at 31,000 feet when it started to descend without any input from the pilot, at a rate of 4,000 feet per minute, before the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000 feet.  According to the EASA, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.  The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in yesterday's disaster.  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last night confirmed that all 150 people on board the aircraft were dead. Alain Vidal, Secretary of State for Transport, Sea and Fisheries, was more final, insisting there were no survivors.  Spanish vice-president Soraya Saez de Sanataria said 45 people with Spanish surnames were travelling on the Airbus A320.  Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said in a hastily-arranged press conference he was cancelling his diary and heading back to Madrid to head a crisis cabinet. He described the accident as a 'dramatic and sad' piece of news but declined to talk about the victims.  He said: 'I profoundly regret this very sad accident. We are going to do all we can.'  He also confirmed he had spoken with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish King Felipe VI.  The monarch announced yesterday shortly after arriving in France for a three-day official visit that he was cancelling the trip.  German media reports say there is a wide field of debris visible.  Pierre Polizzi, the owner of a nearby camping site told Al Jazeera: 'The plane crashed just 2km from here, high on a mountain.  'There was loud noise and then suddenly nothing. At first I thought it came from fighter jets that often hold drills in the area.'  Lucille Polizzi, 18, said: 'We were outside and then suddenly we heard this big noise.  'I thought it was an earthquake. We have earthquakes fairly frequently here, just small ones. I wasn't afraid. My father thought it was a fighter jet but we couldn't see any.  'The noise lasted probably seven or eight seconds. Then it stopped. There was nothing for maybe 15 to 30 seconds. Then a second noise.  'The same as the first noise and it lasted about the same time. I wondered then if it was perhaps an avalanche.'  AIRBUS A320: THE WORKHORSE OF THE SKIES The Airbus A320 - the model of aircraft involved in yesterday's accident - is known as 'the workhorse of the skies' and is used by British Airways and a number of popular budget airlines. Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds. The short-haul, narrow-body airliner is assembled in France, Germany and China and was ranked as the world's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low-cost airlines. This Germanwings Airbus A320 carrying 144 passengers and six crew has crashed in the French Alps And the single-aisle aircraft, which typically seats around 150 passengers, 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes', according to Airbus. Despite the Airbus A320 having one of the best safety records in the world, the widely-used family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used, resulting in scores of deaths. One the first accidents to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of France, not far from the current crash site, when an Air Inter flight came down in the Vosges mountains in 1992. The single-aisle aircraft, which typically seats around 150 passengers, 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes', according to Airbus. Above, file photo of inside an A320 aircraft The Airbus A320-111 was on its approach to Strasbourg airport when it hit La Bloss Mountain, killing 87 of the 96 people on board. The best-known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the US had to put down in the Hudson River in New York. The US Airways flight from the city's LaGuardia Airport heading for Charlotte, North Carolina when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese. One of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in May 2006, when Armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near Sochi, Russia.

The three-day state visit of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain has been suspended following the crash of an Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline  One eyewitness in the village of Le Vernet, where some wreckage has been sighted, told Le Parisien newspaper: 'This morning I heard a massive thud and soon after saw several jets fly over.  'The initial sound was like an avalanche or like the sound of the dynamite they use to cause an avalanche.  FIRST FATAL CRASH IN HISTORY OF GERMANWINGS AIRLINE Germanwings is the low-cost subsidiary of German national carrier Lufthansa, and was first branded in 2002. The company's history can be dated back to 1997, however, when it was known as Eurowings. Lufthansa have announced that Cologne-based Germanwings will be going back to its roots and re-branding back to Eurowings in autumn this year. There are a total of 81 aircraft in Germanwings' fleet, with an average of 9.2 years, flying to 86 destinations around the world. The fleet includes the Airbus A319, Airbus A320 and the Bombardier CRJ900. There had never been a fatal crash in Germanwings' history until the reports of yesterday's tragedy. Back in December 2010, a Germanwings flight was said to be 'moments from crashing' after the pilots were overcome with fumes on landing at Cologne. The plane had 150 passengers on board, and officials accused Germanwings of 'playing down the incident' to 'avoid investigation'. Advertisement  'Then around noon I looked out of the window and saw a column of smoke rising into the air. We're around 3km away, but also in the mountains and snow bound.'  One resident, called Rejane, told BBC News: 'We heard a strange noise. It was a deep noise, not very nice, I thought at first it was a small earthquake.'  Another witness, on the other side of the mountain in Pra Loup, Hervé Graf, of Chalet Hotel Les Blancs, told Mail Online: ' We are probably one of the nearest habitations but saw and heard nothing even though it apparently crashed into the other side of the mountain from us.  'It is not a skiable area and there is deep, deep snow. At this time of the year anyway there are very few tourists or skiers here.'  One man who was due to be on the flight told BBC News he had 'mixed emotions' at changing his travel plans. David Cabanes, who flew on Monday instead, said his flight had been filled with tourists and families.  German airline Lufthansa said it has no information yet about the crash of a jet belonging to its Germanwings subsidiary, describing it as a 'dark day'.  'We do not yet know what has happened to flight 4U 9525,' Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said via Twitter.  'My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors.'  Shares in Lufthansa and Airbus were down 4.7 percent and 2.1 per cent respectively after news of the accident.  Lufthansa was also hit by a four-day pilots' strike last week, although this did not affect Germanwings.  The European Aviation Safety Agency said: 'It is very sad news that the Germanwings flight 4U-9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf crashed in the south of France. All our thoughts are with the families of the victims.  'We are closely monitoring the latest information and we are in contact with the French authorities, Airbus and other organisations involved, in order to provide any support possible.'  Airbus, who manufactured the jet in November 1990, added: 'We have been informed of an accident involving an A320 Family aircraft and all efforts are now going towards assessing the situation.  'We will provide further information as soon as available. Our thoughts are with those affected by this tragic event.'  The crashed A320 is 24 years old and has been with the parent Lufthansa group since 1991, according to online database airfleets.net.  But Captain Peter Benn, speaking from Whiteley in Hampshire, told Channel 4 News: 'When you state the age of the aircraft, it's important to emphasise that these planes are maintained to near perfect condition as can be.  'This is one of the most, if not the most, checked transport in the history of human mobility. The aircraft will have been safely looked after.'  The arrivals board shows flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona without a status at the airport in Dusseldorf  Revealed: Germanwings flight 4U9525 received safety warning just four months ago after sister plane went into tailspin  Sister plane of that involved in yesterday's crash lost altitude late last year  Air safety agency sent out directive warning operators to be aware  Pilot in that incident pulled the plane out of the dive averting problems  Airbus A320s involved in number of accidents since introduced in 1980s  Plane is considered extremely safe and is widely used around world  A safety warning was issued last year when a sister plane of that involved in yesterday's accident suddenly lost altitude.  The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after an Airbus A321 went into an uncontrollable dive north of Pamplona, Spain before recovering.  According to the safety warning, the Lufthansa jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at 31,000 feet when it started to descend without any input from the pilot, at a rate of 4,000 feet per minute, before the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000 feet.  According to the EASA, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.  The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in yesterday's disaster.  In response, Airbus created a 'temporary revision' to all of the aircraft's flight manuals.  The A321 involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in yesterday's crash, carrying an extra 40 passengers.  A similar Airbus plane to that involved in yesterday's crash was put down in the Hudson River, New York in 2009  Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds.

One of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in May 2006, when Armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near Sochi, Russia.  All 113 passengers and crew on the A320-211 died after it flew into terrible weather while approaching the southern Russian city after taking off from Yerevan, Armenia.

In an Atlanta suburb this past weekend, Melissa Alford (a black woman) and her family were hosting an outdoor birthday party in Douglasville, Georgia, when a convoy of seven large pickup trucks donning Confederate flags interrupted the party and pulled into the grass. The occupants then called them niggers and threatened them with violence, according to multiple eyewitnesses, who also stated that the men actually flashed guns at them:    One of at least two cellphone videos from the incident shows Douglasville police officers holding back a group of black men and women as at least seven pickup trucks drive off. The trucks’ white passengers wave as the Confederate, American and military flags mounted on the vehicles flap in the air. . “This is a child’s birthday party,” one woman in the crowd can be heard saying.

A woman who shared the video said the trucks were on her property and their passengers were armed and threatened to “kill y’all [N-words].”  Video can be viewed below."

This means above all that works contained in the estate which turn out to be looted art or which must with high likelihood be viewed as looted art will be restituted to the rightful owners under these principles.” // “Looted art and art which is suspected to be looted art will not be touched by the Bern Art Museum. It will not even make it onto Swiss territory.” // “The decision, ladies and gentlemen, was far from easy for the board of trustees. There were certainly no feelings of triumph. They would be absolutely inappropriate in light of the art collection’s history.” // Overall, it represents an asset for the Bern Art Museum, without a doubt.

0,"FACT CHECK: Was Shawn Fuller, a man suspected of murdering his two toddler sons, a gun enthusiast?  Claim: Shawn Fuller, a man suspected of murdering his two toddler sons, was an “open carry enthusiast.”  TRUE  Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2015]  Origins: In the early morning hours of 9 August 2015, police officers in Iredell County, North Carolina, responded to a call about an incident at the home of Shawn Fuller. Fuller’s brother, not named in media reports, called police at approximately 3:30 AM, stating that Fuller was “intoxicated and firing a weapon”:  A North Carolina man was drunk when he shot and killed his two sons, 3 and 4, and then tried to commit suicide early Sunday, police said. Sheriff Darren Campbell [said] that when deputies arrived at the Statesville home, Fuller was outside the front door suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Fuller was taken to Carolina Medical Center in Charlotte in critical condition. Deputies found the young brothers after going into the home, where they lived with their mom and dad.  Police confirmed that 4-year-old Uriah Fuller and 3-year-old Josiah Fuller were shot multiple times and died on the scene. Shawn Fuller, 31, was transported to a local hospital after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He died a few weeks later.  In that respect, the captions on the image displayed above are largely accurate: both Fuller boys died of gunshot wounds, and their father was the primary (and only) suspect in their shooting.  Separate claims made in the photograph pertained to Fuller’s enthusiasm for firearms and purported advocacy of the open carry of guns. His Facebook page has since been removed from the social network, but several other web sites have carried claims about the type of content it hosted before it was made unavailable.  On 9 August 2015, Charlotte television station WSOC spoke with a local woman who had interacted with Fuller earlier on the day of the shootings. The woman, Kelli Simko, recounted a conversation with Fuller about guns and his belief in the necessity of carrying them in public; and said she later located Fuller on Facebook after reading about the shooting and was troubled by the purportedly violent tenor of his postings:  But for Kelli Simko, 37, who was also in the store at the time, something seemed off. “He had a gun on his belt,” Simko said of her interaction with Fuller earlier in the day. “He told (the clerk) he wouldn’t shop anywhere he couldn’t bring his gun.” In addition to several comments about carrying his gun openly, Fuller talked about how he enrolled his boys in self-defense classes because of how the world is today. “He said how you can’t even walk into a movie theater anymore,” she said. She searched online and found Fuller’s Facebook profile, which included photos of guns and Confederate flags. “It was him… and it was those two little boys… and I can’t stop crying.”  A neighbor of Fuller’s (who declined to be identified) described him to the Charlotte Observer as an avid shooter who was “scared of everything”:  A neighbor who has lived across the street since 1976 also complained about the shooting. She declined to give her name. “There were a lot of cars in and out all the time,” the woman said. “You would think at times there was a firing range down there.” On the occasions when they had talked, Fuller often seemed paranoid and behaved as if he was “scared of everything,” Patterson said. Fuller also worried that someone was trying to break into his home, Patterson said. On Saturday, Patterson drove into his driveway around 12:30 p.m., and Fuller was in the backyard, shooting. He said the shooting continued all day Saturday and into the night.  Purported screenshots from Fuller’s now-deleted Facebook page, containing gun enthusiast memes, have circulated online. Those screen captures cannot be verified, however, as Fuller’s Facebook page is not available.  In January 2016, the meme about Fuller began re-circulating on social media, still claiming (inaccurately) that he had shot his children “this weekend.” However, the events took place in August 2015."
0,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.  The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.  Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.  It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.  CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.  He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.  In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.  ""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.  ""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the suspected gunman in Wednesday's Ottawa shootings, had a criminal record in B.C. and Quebec. (Twitter)  Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.  Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.  Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.  Caught 'by surprise'  In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""  ""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.  Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.  Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.  Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.  Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.  Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.  In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:  NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""  Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""  Justice Minister Peter MacKay: ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes.""

Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.  ""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped.

(Laura Payton/CBC)  Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, said he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.  Walsh said the man hopped over the stone fence that surrounds Parliament Hill, forcing someone out of their car at gunpoint. He then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh said.

0,"WASHINGTON — During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidates Barack Obama and John McCain fought vigorously over who would be toughest on congressional earmarks.  ""We need earmark reform,"" Obama said in September during a presidential debate in Oxford, Miss. ""And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.""  President Barack Obama should prepare to carve out a lot of free time and keep the coffee hot this week as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice.  The bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks — loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress — were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees.  So while Obama and McCain were slamming earmarks on the campaign trail, House and Senate members — Democrats and Republicans — were slapping them into spending bills.  ""It will be a little embarrassing for the president if he signs a bill with that many earmarks on it,"" said Stan Collender, a veteran Washington budget analyst. ""He'll say they're left over from the Bush years, and he as to say that next year the bill will be clean.""  Experts agree that most earmarks are legitimate. Cary Leahey, senior economist with Decision Economics in New York, said the nation's economic crisis is a contributing factor to the plethora of earmarks. Lawmakers can argue that for a relatively small price they've helped boost the economy.  ""One congressman's earmark is another legislative way to fix a serious problem in his district,"" Leahey said.  Kenneth Thomas, a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, agrees.  ""I generally believe that the priority is getting money into the system sooner rather than later, especially if it's for projects that will use local contractors and create jobs,"" he said.  Still, it wasn't supposed to be this way. Earmarks have come under fire because of those that seem to provide what Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls ""laugh lines,"" such as Alaska's ""Bridge to Nowhere"" or North Dakota's Lawrence Welk Museum.  Obama pledged to take a hard hand on earmarks and warned lawmakers in a Feb. 3 letter from Budget Director Peter Orszag not to decorate the recently signed $787.2 billion stimulus bill with them.  Democrats declared the bill earmark-free. Republicans disagreed.  ""While this bill does not include traditional earmarks, we should all understand that there are earmarks in this bill,"" said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. ""There is $850 million ... to bail out Amtrak, a $75 million earmark for the Smithsonian, a $1 billion earmark for the 2010 census.""  Democrats have been trying to revamp the earmark process for about two years. In 2007, they instituted a system that required members to explain the contents of each earmark, as well as a justification for why it was included in the legislation that way. They claimed this led to a reduction in earmarks by as much as 43 percent.  But critics contended the system still had problems. Simply making information more available, they said, didn't address the major criticism: That such projects should go through the regular legislative process, subject to detailed hearings and bipartisan votes.  Not only does this mean the public has no chance to challenge questionable spending, but too often powerful interests who know how to work the system get favorite measures inserted.  For instance, Congressional Quarterly reported recently that more than 100 House members got earmarks for clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm with close ties to Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who heads the powerful defense spending subcommittee. The CQ Politics analysis said that in the 2009 defense spending bill, which Congress approved last year, PMA clients got about $300 million.  The CQ study came after reports that the FBI is investigating the possibility of illegal campaign contributions by PMA to Murtha and other lawmakers. A Murtha spokesman said earlier this month that the FBI probe has nothing to do with Murtha. A PMA spokesman declined to comment on the probe.  Appropriations committee chairmen say they are on track to reform the earmark process beginning in fiscal 2010 by requiring members to make public their requests early, so the public can scrutinize them and presumably contact lawmakers.  The change, though, doesn't apply to the 2009 funding that Congress will consider next week.  Several experts believe that dramatically reducing the number of earmarks, while a laudable goal, is almost impossible. But others contend that earmarks aren't that big of a problem.  ""Earmarks get more attention than they deserve,"" said MacGuineas. ""The problem is that they cause a loss of confidence in the whole budget process.""

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:      “This bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States. We are giving every member of Congress an opportunity to stand with the American people by affirming their opposition to bringing these terrorists into our communities, and we hope they join us. Equally as important, this bill holds the Administration accountable if it acts unilaterally against the will of the American people.  “The world did not suddenly become safe in January 2009. There are still terrorists around the world who are committed to killing Americans and destroying our way of life. A number of those terrorists are being held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay right now. If the Administration is allowed to proceed, they won’t be there for long. In fact, they may be right here, in the United States. I have been urging the Administration to finally present to the American people its plan for what to do with the terrorists held at Guantanamo and for confronting and defeating the global terrorist threat. Right now, that plan does not exist, and the safety of our nation depends on it.  “Our ranking members John McHugh, Pete Hoekstra, Lamar Smith, Peter King, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen all deserve great credit for their work on this measure. I thank them for their efforts in crafting this critically important bill.”  NOTE: Following is a summary of the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act:  Affirming Congress’ Opposition to the Release and Transfer of Terrorists. The bill affirms Congress’ opposition to transferring or releasing terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. Most Americans do not support releasing these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay prison and transferring them into the United States. The bill gives Congress an opportunity to show that it stands with the American people on this critical matter, and opposes the release and transfer of these terrorists.  Governor & State Legislature Pre-Approval. The measure prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without express approval from the state’s governor and legislature, and certifies to Congress that strict requirements have been met. For example, the Administration must certify to the respective governor and state legislature that the detainee does not pose a security risk to the United States. The certifications must be made 60 days before any transfer or release.  Presidential Certification Requirements. The measure prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides the following notification and certification to Congress regarding:    - The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States.    - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee.    - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee.    - The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States.  #####"

0,"Two “despicable attacks” on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country’s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.  Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.  The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.  Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.  “This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.  “We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.  “But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”  Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”  National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”  The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.  Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""  But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”  RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.  Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.  Panic on the Hill  The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.  When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.  A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.  Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.  Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.  Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.  Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.  Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.  ""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.  ""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""  Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.  Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.  “This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.  He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.  “If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.  The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.  Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.  “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”  The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.  On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.  Security beefed up  The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.  Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.  U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.  Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.  The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”  “We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.  A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”  With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press  An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

Mr. Obama, of Illinois, struck at Mrs. Clinton’s claim to expertise in the arena of national security, saying she had one moment of transformative decision  Iraq  and she fumbled it.  “What precise foreign-policy experience is she claiming that makes her qualified to answer that telephone call at 3 a.m. in the morning?” Mr. Obama asked an audience of more than 3,000 in a high school gymnasium and overflow rooms here. “When it came to making the most important decision of our generation, Senator Clinton got it wrong.”  Mrs. Clinton’s take on Mr. Obama hours earlier was not much more forgiving. She again suggested that his speeches were empty and that the first-term senator was too green to occupy the Oval Office in a time of crisis."

The driver was arrested for drug-related DUI (Driving Under the Influence), and when officers searched Hilton, ""they found her in possession of a controlled substance"" which turned out to be cocaine.

A construction worker at the parliament told the Reuters news agency he heard a gunshot, and then saw a man dressed in black with a scarf over his face running towards the building with a gun.

0,"Marty McFly will be arriving from the past at 4:29 PM on 21 October 2015, and not a moment sooner.  As chronicled elsewhere on the pages of snopes.com, an online prank that has been running for several years is to trick viewers into believing that the current date matches the future date visited by Marty McFly via his time-traveling DeLorean automobile in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II. Such japes are often digitally perpetrated by altering screenshots taken from the movie and replacing the value seen in the “Destination Time” field of the DeLorean’s time travel panel with the current date (or one in the near future), as seen in this example from 2012:  Among other implementations of this hoax, a Tumblr page has been established that automatically creates images with the date of Marty’s arrival matching the current date, to make it easier for people to troll their gullible friends.  It isn’t difficult to find a definitive answer about the true date when Marty McFly will return, however. As a clip from Back to the Future Part II documents, Marty started out with Doc Brown in 1985 and traveled into the future, arriving there at 4:29 PM on 21 October 2015:  https://youtu.be/6Tf8mPsvcOs  Fans waiting to greet Marty promptly upon his arrival at 4:29 PM would need to know the proper time zone, so we’ll note for the record that according to an 1885 railroad map from Back to the Future Part III, Hill Valley is located in Northern California (and is thus in the Pacific Time Zone):  For those counting down the minutes until Marty shows up in our timeline, the web page at october212015.com will handle that chore for you."

Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain ""will make Cheney look like Gandhi.""2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3  McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a ""second job"" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: ""The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.""7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his ""spiritual guide,"" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a ""false religion."" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church ""the Antichrist"" and a ""false cult.""9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0—yes, zero—from the League of Conservation Voters last year.10  John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

In the video below, Beech Grove police answered the question, “What should you do if you witness a fight?”  Beech Grove Police say they are alarmed at the behavior of the young boy and question the environment he is being raised in. They are considering whether to involve the Department of Child Services in their investigation.  Police are also exploring whether to file charges in connection with the fight."
0,"'A Charlie Brown Christmas' At 50  Enlarge this image toggle caption Charles M. Schulz/AP Charles M. Schulz/AP  Enlarge this image toggle caption Nicole Wilder/ABC Nicole Wilder/ABC  Tonight (Monday), ABC will air a special at 8 p.m. ET called It's Your 50th Christmas, Charlie Brown, to mark the half-century since A Charlie Brown Christmas first aired in 1965. Then at 9, it will air the special itself.  There's so much about A Charlie Brown Christmas that you'd never see on network television holiday specials now, I suspect. A special that, if not for children, is certainly intended to be accessible by children would never use that ""guzzling Irish coffee in a bar on a snow-blanketed night in New York when you just got stood up but you feel weirdly OK about it"" Vince Guaraldi music. Mass-marketed entertainment doesn't tend to trust kids' capacity to appreciate either stripped-down scores or the natural blues of winter that much. The kids' chorus singing would be replaced by a Demi Lovato version of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" or something like that. Pardon the cynicism, but ... wouldn't it?  Watching the special now, its bleakness is palpable and bracing. It opens with Charlie Brown defining his problem in part as, in these words, ""I'm not happy. I don't feel the way I'm supposed to feel."" Straight-up dread, straight-up emotional emptiness. When Linus — who is, in many ways, the nice one — tells him, ""Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you're the Charlie Browniest,"" it feels like the kind of improvisational brutality in which kids really do specialize.  And that's not his only problem. Charlie Brown says things like, ""I know nobody likes me. Why do we have to have a holiday season to emphasize it?"" I know nobody likes me. That's unvarnished, and while the special will end with everyone telling him ""Merry Christmas,"" you will not really see much evidence in the next 20-plus minutes that they do, in fact, like him. He's sad, for real, and he lives in that feeling, and he uses the word ""depressed"" to describe it. As with most things in Charlie Brown's life, it is a load that will be temporarily lifted, but never resolved.  He's so desperate for help, in fact, that he continues to pay Lucy five cents to think poorly of him in more sophisticated language. Her solution to his need for ""involvement"" is to make him the director of the Christmas play, a doomed scenario from the start, no?  But of course, it's also unlikely that a special would end with a character reading Scripture with the earnestness of Linus. (It might be unlikely for a character to exist with the earnestness of Linus in the first place.) But as common as it is for viewers to remark on the religious content of the special, that content doesn't exist in a vacuum. It doesn't exist to say, ""It's a religious holiday, and therefore you should spurn its secular aspects."" Quite the contrary: Linus' reading inspires Charlie Brown to redouble his efforts to decorate his sad little tree. And it inspires his friends to follow him and, when he becomes overwhelmed with sadness about said sad little tree, to help him.  So as much as A Charlie Brown Christmas is about the significance of the religious tradition as what Christmas is ""really about,"" it sees that tradition at least in part as a gateway to, and an inspiration for, other actions. It doesn't only suggest Christmas is really about the Bible story; it suggests Christmas is also really about friends, dogs, cooperating, the beauty of humble things, singing out loud, and hope. It's just not about writing your Christmas list and asking for, as Sally does, ""10s and 20s.""  The only thing you really can't recapture from 1965 is scarcity. It was once the case that Christmas specials could be seen only at Christmas. Now, you and your family can watch Charlie Brown anytime you want, anywhere you want. It's convenience at the expense of a certain kind of preciousness, to be sure. But if you still want to be the kind of person who watches things when they happen to be on, Monday night is the night for that sad little tree."

The country singer, meanwhile, proved that she still got the chops as she went head-to-head with Carrie Underwood at the Country Music Television awards last June 10.  Lately, Miranda Lambert and ""The Voice"" judge Blake Shelton have been hounded by divorce rumors but they continue to prove their critics wrong as their marriage remains strong.  In April, for example, the National Enquirer, per Celebrity Dirty Laundry, claimed that split looms for Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert because of her excess pounds.  ""Miranda has thrown in the towel on dieting, and that has Blake feeling like she's just letting herself go. He wants her slim and fit - not pudgy and porking out!"" the source claimed.  But in an interview with Success, Miranda Lambert addressed the divorce rumors with Blake Shelton.  ""We make a conscious effort to spend time together. If you don't, you will lose sight of each other,"" Lambert says.  ""My tip would be, don't say, I'll get to it in a week, because no one knows what tomorrow will bring. And we both have times when we say, 'Put the phone down. There's nothing on Twitter that is more important than us right now.' You have to make that effort.""  Miranda Lambert also credited her Blake Shelton's calming influence on her.  ""He's a very calm, even person. He takes things as they come, and I'm sort of all over the place,"" she said.  Meanwhile, Miranda Lambert went head-to-head with fellow superstar Carrie Underwood but this time, she lost to the former ""American Idol"" alum for the best video of the year. But all is not lost for Blake Shelton's wife as she and Carrie Underwood won in the best collaborative video for their duet ""Somethin' Bad."""

At least one gunman stormed into a cafe in the city's downtown area and took an unknown number of hostages, while placing a black flag with Arabic writing in the window  At least one gunman stormed into a cafe in the city's downtown area and took an unknown number of hostages, while placing a black flag with Arabic writing in the window  SYDNEY, Australia - A hostage situation continued to unfold in downtown Sydney on Monday morning, as an apparent gunman entered a cafe and allegedly held its occupants. A black flag with white Arabic writing could later be seen in the window, according to multiple reports.  Speaking on the crisis, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the motivation of the perpetrator was unclear, but speculated on the possibility that it might be political.  Early reports indicate that the gunman is acting alone and could be holding anywhere between 13 and 20 hostages. But currently there is no confirmation from police on the number of hostages taken.  New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""at least"" one armed offender involved in situation who has taken an ""undisclosed"" number of hostages. But he also said it was not clear why the gunman took the hostages, and ""have not confirmed that this is a terrorism-related event.""  However, a police spokeswoman said three unidentified hostages have escaped the cafe. ""They are now out of the building and they are now with police,"" said Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn. She also added that police negotiators are attempting to contact the suspect.  Australia has been a vocal backer of the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has raised fears of reprisal attacks everywhere. The building where the standoff is taking place reportedly holds the U.S. Consulate and offices of former Prime Minister John Howard. All consulate staff were accounted for and safe.  White House officials say President Obama has been briefed on the situation.  Hostages pressed against a window in Sydney, Australia during a standoff between a gunman and police. CBS News  Several people inside a chocolate shop could be seen through the windows with their hands held in the air.  New South Wales state police would not say what was happening inside the shop or whether hostages were being held. But television footage shot through the store's windows showed several people with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass.  The footage showed two people inside the Lindt chocolate shop holding up what appeared to be a black flag with white Arabic writing on it. It was not immediately clear what the flag said.  Zain Ali, the head of the Islamic Studies Research Unit at the University of Auckland, said it was difficult to read the message because media images showed only the lower part of the flag. But he believed it was the Shahada, or declaration of faith, largely because a black flag with white writing in a contemporary context often contains that message. He said he could make out the word ""Muhammad.""  Ali said the Shahada translates as ""There is no deity of worship except God (Allah), and Muhammad is the messenger of God."" It is considered the first pillar of Islam's five pillars of faith, and has been used by groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State but wasn't invented by them, Ali said.  The Australian National Imams Council released a joint statement with the Grand Mufti of Australia condemning the taking of hostages, Reuters reported. ""Such actions are denounced in part and in whole in Islam,"" the statement said. The group said it is waiting for more information on the motivations and identity of the perpetrator.  The cafe is located in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. It is home to the state premier's office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of the nation's largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away.  Meanwhile, soon after news of the hostage situation spread the Sydney Opera House was evacuated after a suspicious package was found, Reuters reported. It was unclear if the package discovery was related to the standoff.  Speaking to reporters on Monday, Abbott said national and local officials are responding as best they could.  Armed police run toward a cafe in the central business district of Sydney on December 15, 2014. SAEED KHAN / AFP / Getty Images  ""We don't know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,"" Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in the nation's capital, Canberra. ""We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, there are people who would wish to do us harm.""  Abbott said the National Security Committee of Cabinet met to be briefed on the situation.  ""The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,"" he said. ""Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society - nothing should ever change that. And that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual.""  Lindt Chocolate Cafe Australia issued a statement on Monday expressing the company's attention to the situation.  ""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company's Facebook page read. ""The matter is being dealt with by the authorities and we are waiting for any updates from them."""
0,"Sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, a former 29-year veteran of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), had the responsibility of safeguarding the House of Commons and Parliament buildings, in addition to its occupants.  Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino told the Toronto Sun: “All the details are not in, but the sergeant-at-arms, a former Mountie, is the one that engaged the gunman, or one of them at least, and stopped this.  “He did a great job and, from what I know, shot the gunman and he is now deceased.”  He also added on Twitter: “I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”  Mr Vickers, 58, was also labelled a hero by Canada’s Minister of Justice Peter MacKay, who tweeted: “To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes #cndpoli”.

Mr Vickers had been appointed to the largely role in 2006 after joining the House of Commons as Director of Security Operations in 2005.  Upon his appointment, Rob Nicholson, Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, said: ""Not only does he bring to the position an impressive background in safety and security, he also embodies those qualities that parliamentarians and Canadians expect in a Sergeant-at-Arms.  ""I have every confidence that Mr. Vickers will fulfill his role as Sergeant-at-Arms with the same loyalty, distinction and honour that he has displayed during his career, both with the RCMP and, most recently, in his current role as Director of Security Operations with the House of Commons""  Canadian police are continuing to hunt for possible at-large shooters following the gunfire at Ottawa’s National War Memorial and its Parliament.  One soldier who was targeted at the National War Memorial has died, while a further two people were also taken to hospital and are understood to be in a stable condition.  Canadian authorities have not yet revealed the soldier's identity and have not elaborated on a possible motive for the attack, nor any details on the deceased suspect."
0,"Police say three people are dead -- including the gunman -- after authorities stormed a Sydney cafe early Tuesday, bringing to a dramatic end a 16-hour standoff in which a jihadist and murder suspect had held 17 hostages in a scene much of the world watched on television.  A series of explosions, believed to be gunshots and flash grenades, came just before 2:30 a.m. local time as several more hostages fled Lindt Chocolat Cafe, where a man identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian also known for sending hate mail to the families of fallen soldiers, was holed up with the captives. Authorities say Monis was shot and killed during the confrontation with police.  A 34-year-old man and 38-year-old woman also were among the dead, police said. Four people were injured in the raid, including a female hostage who was shot in the leg, an official told The Associated Press. One policeman, who suffered a gunshot wound in the face, is in good condition and is grateful to be alive, Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters at a press conference.  Several people were taken from the building on stretchers as an alarm rang and police in riot gear moved in and out of the shop, in the heart of Australia's largest city's business district. A bomb disposal robot was seen being deployed in the shop, though police said the standoff was over. Authorities later said no explosive devices were found.  The handful of hostages seen fleeing as the explosions echoed through the predawn air followed escapes hours earlier by five captives.  More On This...  ""Sydney siege is over. More details to follow"" New South Wales police posted on Twitter.  Scipione called the ordeal a ""distressing time"" for the families of those involved.  “We are strong together. We will get through this,"" added New South Wales Premier Mike Baird.  For hours, television news crews had broadcast footage of frightened hostages looking out through the front window. Initially, police did not identify Monis, though they knew he was the suspect inside. His identity was known early on to police and media alike, but was only released for the record by police sources as night fell on Sydney with the nation transfixed on the televised scene.  During the evening hours on Monday, several people were seen with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people were seen holding up a black flag associated with Islamic fanaticism. Australian broadcaster Network Ten reported that Monis, seen wielding a shotgun and a machete, has forced hostages to call him ""The Brother"" and demanded to speak directly with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.  ""The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,"" Seven Network television news reporter Chris Reason said, according to The Associated Press. ""One woman we've counted was there for at least two hours -- an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.""  [image]  The drama began during the Monday morning rush hour and carried into night time in Australia's largest city. Five hostages escaped some six hours into the ordeal, running out a side door and into the arms of police, who have the shop surrounded. The shop is in Sydney's central business district in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Shops in the area were closed and people were ordered to stay out.  A journalist on the scene tweeted that the terror suspect appeared to fly into a rage after the hostages escaped.  [pullquote]  ""The gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated, shouting at remaining hostages,"" tweeted journalist Chris Reason.  Reason described Monis as unshaven, wearing a white shirt and a black cap, and holding what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun. He could be seen pacing back and forth past the cafe's four windows. Sky News described Monis as bearded, middle-aged and wearing a black and white headband. Sky cited reports that he is known to police and media outlets.  ""Just two hours ago when we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,"" Reason reported.  [image]  Monis, who reportedly emigrated to Australia in 1996, is known in Australia for his public campaign of writing letters to the families of fallen soldiers calling them “murderers” and urging the recipients to lobby the government to withdraw from Afghanistan. Haron was charged in 2009 with using the postal service to harass in a case he fought all the way to Australia’s highest court, which dismissed his appeal.  Last year, he was charged in connection with the murder of his ex-wife in a case that is pending as Monis is free on bail. He was charged earlier this year with sexual assault of a woman who went to his office in New South Wales for ""spiritual healing.""  ""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act. It's a damaged goods individual who's done something outrageous,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.""  Monis ran a website which was taken down shortly after he was named as the gunman in the hostage situation, Sky News reports. In a letter posted to the website, which he signed Sheikh Haron, he accused Australia, Britain and the U.S. of ""oppression and terrorism"" and posted images of dead children.  Monis also reportedly called for non-violent activism, writing that ""Islam is the religion of peace and a Muslim should be a peace activist.""  As night descended on Sydney, the lights inside the shop went off, but it was unclear if that was by the suspected jihadist's choice or if the police made the cafe go dark as a negotiating tactic. Earlier, the gunman appeared to be rotating frightened hostages in front of the window, holding up the black Islamist flag ""Shahada"" flag, an emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra, the Al Qaeda-linked terror group fighting - sometimes with, sometimes against - Islamic State in Syria.  The gunman was reportedly relaying threats and demands through two hostages, and claimed to have planted two bombs inside the cafe and two others elsewhere in Sydney's central business district.  Late Monday, Abbott released a pre-recorded statement calling the attack ""very disturbing"" and ""profoundly shocking."" His office didn't respond to the gunman's demands.  Three men were seen running from a fire exit of the cafe approximately six hours after the hostage situation began at 9:45 a.m. local time. Moments later, two women believed to be employees, followed suit. It was not immediately clear how the hostages escaped.  The U.S. Consulate, located just south of the cafe, was also evacuated and a warning issued urging Americans in Sydney to ""maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security."" A White House official told Fox News that President Obama had been briefed on the situation.  Lindt Australia posted a message on its Facebook page thanking the public for its support.  ""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company wrote.  The government raised Australia's terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities -- Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.  The Islamic State group, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, Islamic State group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued an audio message urging so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all ""disbelievers,"" whether they be civilians or soldiers.  Click for more from Sky News Australia.  Click for more from The Australian.

The suspect was armed with two guns, the agency quoted a police source as saying.  One person was wounded in the attack at a kosher store in the eastern part of the French capital, reports said.  The gunman was suspected of being the same man who killed a policewoman in Montrouge, southern Paris, on Thursday.  The shooting took place in Porte de Vincennes. Pic: Alexis Corbiere  The gunman is thought to have links to the assailants who stormed satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo a day earlier, killing 12 people.

Reports say at least one hostage was taken. Pic: Alexis Corbiere  In Thursday's attack, the gunman was wearing a bullet-proof vest and was carrying a pistol and an automatic rifle.

0,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner.

0,"The flag held by hostages against the window of a Sydney cafe in television pictures beamed around the world is not directly associated with the Islamic State group, but has been co-opted by other jihadist organizations, Australian media reported Monday.  The white Arabic writing on the black flag is the Shahada, or Islamic declaration of faith. Translated, the statement means ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger."" It is considered the first of Islam's five pillars of faith, and is similar to the Lord's Prayer in Christianity. It is pervasive throughout Islamic culture, including the green flag of Saudi Arabia. Jihadis have expropriated the Shahada in their own black flag.  ""It is not the Islamic State flag per se,"" Ben MacQueen, a senior politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne, told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""It has been used in recent times, for example, by Chechen groups.""  Australian authorities have repeatedly warned about the threat posed by Islamic State, better known as ISIS. Earlier this week, the government estimated that approximately 70 Australians are currently fighting with the terror group in Iraq and Syria, while another 20 are believed to have been killed in action and 20 others are believed to have returned home.  In September, police made over a dozen separate raids in the suburbs of three cities, including Sydney, in an effort to break up a plot to behead a randomly selected person on a city street and record it. Days later, Australian intelligence agencies said they had uncovered an ISIS plot to attack the country's parliament.  Terrorism experts said Monday that the flag used by the unidentified hostage-taker neither confirms nor rules out an association with ISIS.  ""Getting hold of an [ISIS] flag would be quite difficult,"" Greg Barton of Monash University in Melbourne told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""and people will make do with what they have got.""  MacQueen concurred, suggesting that the hostages were ""maybe young guys, maybe not savvy, they've got their hands on a bit of paraphernalia to suggest they have aligned themselves with the IS. If this was centrally organized from Syria or Iraq they would not be using that flag.""  The Associated Press contributed to this report.  Click for more from the Sydney Morning Herald."
0,"Live television footage in Sydney estimates that there are 13 hostages in the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney, Australia. Their hands are pressed against the windows, where a black and white flag with Arabic letters is visible.  While initially reported as an ISIS flag, ITV has reported that the text translates as ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is the messenger of God."" And that it is not specifically linked with that particular terrorist group.  Australia is backing the United States in its action against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Armed police have closed off the surrounding area, which includes the Reserve Bank of Australia. Trains and buses have halted after a train operator said there was a bomb threat called in at Martin Place. Airspace over the area has also been closed.  According to Business Insider, the man, armed with a shotgun, have made demands to speak to ""a senior Australian public figure"" and warn that bombs have been placed at various locations in the city. That report, however, has not been verified.  Local officials are concerned that the armed man might be part of a home-grown Muslim faction that has returned from the Middle East.  UPDATE: Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressed reporters, and said security agencies had not detected any additional plots but that there are citizens in Australia with the ""intent and capability"" to carry out a terror attack. Abbott said there will be ""more security"" at airports, ports, military bases, public buildings and large public events.  ""Normal life in Australia can and must go on,"" Abbott said.

0,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Heavily armed Australian police stormed a Sydney cafe early on Tuesday morning and freed a number of hostages being held there at gunpoint, in a dramatic end to a 16-hour siege in which three people including the attacker were killed.  Police have not publicly identified the gunman but a police source named him as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian refugee and self-styled sheikh known for sending hate mail to the families of Australian troops killed in Afghanistan. He was charged last year with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife.  Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was well known to authorities and had a history of extremism and mental instability.  During the siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney’s central business district, hostages had been forced to display an Islamic flag, igniting fears of a jihadist attack in the heart of the country’s biggest city.  Around 2 a.m. local time (10.00 a.m. ET on Monday), at least six people believed to have been held captive managed to flee after gunshots were heard coming from the cafe.  Police then moved in, with heavy gunfire and blasts from stun grenades echoing from the building.  “They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn’t enter there would have been many more lives lost,” said Andrew Scipione, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales.  An investigation would determine whether hostages were killed by the gunman or died in cross-fire, Scipione told reporters just before dawn.  Police said a 50-year-old man, believed to be the attacker, was killed. Television pictures showed he appeared to have been armed with a sawn-off shotgun.  A man aged 34 and a 38-year-old woman were also killed, police said. The man was the cafe manager and the woman was a mother and barrister, local media reported. Four were wounded, including a policeman hit in the face with shotgun pellets.  Medics tried to resuscitate at least one person after the raid and took away several wounded people on gurneys, said a Reuters witness at the scene. Bomb squad members moved in to search for explosives, but none were found.  So far 17 hostages have been accounted for, including at least five others who were released or escaped on Monday.  “To the people of Sydney, this was an isolated incident ... Do not let this sort of incident bring about any loss of confidence of working or visiting our city,” said Scipione.  On Tuesday morning, the area near the cafe remained cordoned off, with bystanders and passing office workers leaving flowers under police tape. Flags flew at half mast across the city.  Leaders from around the world had expressed their concern over the siege, including Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada, which suffered an attack on its parliament by a suspected jihadist sympathizer in October.  NO LINKS TO TERROR GROUPS  Monis was found guilty in 2012 of sending offensive and threatening letters to families of eight Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, as a protest against Australia’s involvement in the conflict, according to local media reports. Monis was also facing more than 40 charges of sexual assault.  Slideshow ( 32 images )  “He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,” Abbott told reporters in Canberra. The prime minister did not identify the gunman.  A U.S. security official said the U.S. government was being advised by Australia that there was no sign at this stage that the gunman was connected to known terrorist organizations.  Although the hostage taker was known to the authorities, security experts said preventing attacks by people acting alone could be difficult.  “We are entering a new phase of terrorism that is far more dangerous and more difficult to defeat than al Qaeda ever was,” said Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin, speaking in New York.  Slideshow ( 32 images )  ON ALERT  Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its escalating action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, has been on high alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East or their supporters.  News footage showed hostages in the cafe holding up a black and white flag displaying the Shahada, a testament to the faith of Muslims. The flag has been popular among Sunni Islamist militant groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.  The incident forced the evacuation of nearby buildings and sent shockwaves around a country where many people were turning their attention to the Christmas holiday after earlier security scares.  In September, anti-terrorism police said they had thwarted an imminent threat to behead a random member of the public and days later, a teenager in the city of Melbourne was shot dead after attacking two anti-terrorism officers with a knife.  The siege cafe is in Martin Place, a pedestrian strip popular with workers on a lunch break, which was revealed as a potential location for the thwarted beheading.  Muslim leaders urged calm. The Australian National Imams Council condemned “this criminal act unequivocally” in a joint statement with the Grand Mufti of Australia.  The security operation was the biggest in Sydney since a bombing at the Hilton Hotel killed two people in 1978."
0,"NEWS: President Obama is reportedly pushing to extend gun background checks to Social Security disability recipients.  Claim: President Obama is planning to ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns.  MIXTURE  WHAT’S TRUE: The Obama administration is seeking to use Social Security Administration data about disability recipients to enforce existing gun purchase restrictions.  WHAT’S FALSE: President Obama is planning to bar all Social Security recipients from owning guns.  Origins: In a case reminiscent of a January 2009 piece of satire, July 2015 news reports indicated that the Obama administration was seeking tighter controls over firearm purchases by pushing to bar Social Security beneficiaries from owning guns if they lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs.  The move is being tagged as part of an effort by the Obama administration to strengthen gun control after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a plan that includes trying to plug holes in the firearms purchase background check system. The intent of the Social Security check is to bring the Social Security Administration in line with other laws that regulate who gets reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), a database used to prevent gun sales to excluded classes such as felons, drug addicts, dishonorably discharged service members, fugitives, and illegal immigrants. (That is, the Obama administration isn’t seeking to create new classes of persons excluded from gun ownership — those exclusions already exist, and the administration is only positing the use of Social Security Administration reporting as a method of enforcing them.)  Such a move could potentially affect millions of Social Security disability recipients whose payments are handled by others due to “marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease.” Those persons would likely be identified through the reporting of anyone who has been declared incompetent to manage their own pension or disability payments and has been assigned a fiduciary as a result.  Opponents of the plan maintain that the implementation of such a background check system could unfairly exclude large numbers of people who pose no real danger to others from gun ownership:  Critics — including gun rights activists, mental health experts and advocates for the disabled — say that expanding the list of prohibited gun owners based on financial competence is wrongheaded. Though such a ban would keep at least some people who pose a danger to themselves or others from owning guns, the strategy undoubtedly would also include numerous people who may just have a bad memory or difficulty balancing a checkbook, the critics argue. “Someone can be incapable of managing their funds but not be dangerous, violent or unsafe,” said Dr. Marc Rosen, a Yale psychiatrist who has studied how veterans with mental health problems manage their money. “They are very different determinations.” Rosen said some [people] may avoid seeking help for mental health problems out of fear that they would be required to give up their guns. Ari Ne’eman, a member of the National Council on Disability, said the independent federal agency would oppose any policy that used assignment of a representative payee as a basis to take any fundamental right from people with disabilities. “The rep payee is an extraordinarily broad brush,” he said.  The federal background check system was created in 1993 through the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (named after White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was severely wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan) and requires gun stores to check the names of prospective buyers through the system before every sale. The database holds over 13 million records, entered at the local, state, and federal level, but it has not always served its intended purpose due to inconsistencies in reporting and use — for example, when Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, it was later found that he had been declared mentally ill by a court and ordered to undergo treatment, but the law in effect at the time did not require that he be added to the database.  A similar system already in use by the VA for beneficiaries has drawn similar criticisms:  The VA reports names under a category in gun control regulations known as “adjudicated as a mental defective,” terminology that derives from decades-old laws. Its only criterion is whether somebody has been appointed a fiduciary. More than half of the names on the VA list are of people 80 or older, often suffering from dementia, a reasonable criterion for prohibiting gun ownership. But the category also includes anybody found by a “court, board, commission or other lawful authority” to be lacking “the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs” for a wide variety of reasons. The agency’s efforts have been criticized by a variety of groups. Social Security would generally report names under the same “mental defective” category. The agency is still figuring out how that definition should be applied. About 2.7 million people are now receiving disability payments from Social Security for mental health problems, a potentially higher risk category for gun ownership. An addition 1.5 million have their finances handled by others for a variety of reasons. Since 2008, VA beneficiaries have been able to get off the list by filing an appeal and demonstrating that they pose no danger to themselves or others. But as of April [2015], just nine of 298 appeals have been granted, according to data provided by the VA. Thirteen others were pending, and 44 were withdrawn after the VA overturned its determination of financial incompetence."

0,"A Swiss museum on Monday accepted the bequest of an art collection hoarded during the Nazi era and left to it by German recluse art collector Cornelius Gurlitt.  The president of the board of trustees of the Bern Museum of Fine Arts, Christoph Schäublin, made the announcement at a press conference in the German capital, Berlin.  He gave assurances that all works in the collection that had been looted from Jewish owners during the Nazi era would be returned to their rightful owners, adding that works which were suspected of having been stolen would remain in Germany and be investigated by a special task force established to determine their provenance.  The costs for restoring the works to their rightful owners would be taken over by Germany, he said.  A summary (PDF) of the agreement between the Bern Museum of Fine Arts, the German state of Bavaria and the German Federal Government can be seen here.  Spectacular find  Authorities in Bavaria seized the spectacular trove of more than 1,000 artworks - including priceless paintings and sketches by Picasso, Monet, Chagall, Liebermann (above) and other masters - from the flat of German collector Cornelius Gurlitt as part of a tax probe in 2012.  More than 300 other works were later discovered in a home Gurlitt owned in Salzburg.  Gurlitt, who bequeathed the collection to the museum when he died in May, was the son of one of Adolf Hitler's art dealers, who helped plunder artworks from museums and Jewish collectors.  Angry at his treatment by German authorities, who confiscated all of the Munich works, Gurlitt left the collection to a Swiss museum rather than a German one.  Legal challenges likely  Before his death, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether any of the works should be restored to heirs of the former Jewish owners. Authorities say the deal would be binding on anyone who accepts the inheritance.  A report by the German news weeky Der Spiegel said that nearly 500 of the works were suspected of being looted.  One of Gurlitt's cousins, 86-year-old Uta Werner, has also laid claim to the trove after a psychiatric assessment called into question Gurlitt's testamentary capacity when writing the will.  That claim could lead to years of legal limbo, with Jewish descendants of the original owners fighting their claims in German courts.  The Munich court dealing with the claim said it would have to be settled before the collection finds its final home anywhere. A court spokeswoman said she did not know how long this would take.  Jewish groups and the US and Israeli governments put pressure on Germany to establish a task force to investigate the provenance of the works.  tj/jr (dpa, AFP)"
0,"  Alexander Panetta, The Canadian Press      WASHINGTON -- The chaos in Canada's capital attracted the attention of people around the world Wednesday, including U.S. President Barack Obama who received a briefing on the developments from the Oval Office.  The U.S. government increased security in different locations, including at its embassy in Ottawa and reportedly also at its own tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Cemetery near downtown Washington.  Obama spoke by phone with Prime Minister Stephen Harper hours after a masked gunman shot an honour guard at the National War Memorial.  A spokesman for the U.S. president began the White House daily briefing with a word of condolence, as news of the incident spread around the world.  ""Before I go to your questions, there is some sad news out of Canada today I just wanted to talk about,"" said Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest.  ""The thoughts and prayers of everybody here at the White House go out to the families of those who were affected by today's shooting in Canada, as well as to the family of the soldier who was killed earlier this week.""  He said officials throughout the U.S. government had been in close touch with their counterparts in Canada -- which he described as a valued friend and partner.  British Prime Minister David Cameron took to Twitter to express his indignation at the events unfolding in Canada: ""I'm appalled by today's attack in Ottawa. I offer my full support to (at)pmharper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident.""  Meanwhile, the Canada-U.S. North American Aerospace Defence Command said it had taken steps so that it could respond should there be any incidents involving aviation.  Down the street from the White House, on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Canadian embassy denied a U.S. media report that it had been placed on lockdown. A spokeswoman for the embassy said that, following news of the shooting, staff there simply locked the embassy's front door.  The shooting quickly became a top news story in numerous countries.  All the main American news networks offered live coverage throughout the day. It was also the lead item on the best-known newspapers in a number of countries including the U.S., the UK, Mexico, France and Italy.  The top headline on France's Le Monde newspaper website was, ""Ottawa Boucle"" (Ottawa On Lockdown). Italy's La Repubblica website ran numerous headlines underneath one that declared, ""Canada Sotto Attacco"" (Canada Under Attack).  Even in Turkey -- which borders an active war zone where an international coalition is fighting Islamist rebels -- the Canadian events became a top news item.  A number of Canadian politicians who witnessed the scenes on Parliament Hill appeared on American news shows to describe what they'd seen. The NDP's Charlie Angus described hearing the gunshots from inside the Opposition members' chamber during the weekly caucus meeting.  Angus told Fox News that Canadians weren't going to be intimidated by this type of act.  ""We're not gonna let punks, or crazies, or terrorists, take us down. Not gonna happen,"" the NDP MP told the cable-news outlet.  ""We don't give in to it.""  One U.S. law-enforcement analyst said this incident will prompt the same kind of scrutiny that occurred when a knife-wielding man recently jumped the fence to enter the White House.  That incident prompted a series of follow-up stories about other security lapses, which led to the resignation of the head of the Secret Service.  A recurring theme of some of the American news coverage was that question of security: How did a gunman manage to walk into Canada's Parliament?"
1,"Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom – News 8 Louisiana – Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua Johnson shoving sausages under her shirt. CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.  The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will “haunt his dreams forever.” The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said that when he entered “She didn’t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.”  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Shocked, and also frightened for his safety due to the fact that Johnson is a “big girl,” the 140 pound security guard said he ran out until police arrived. When they did, female officers entered the restroom with Johnson still “putting in work with the sausage.” All in all, it took 7 police officers to restrain Johnson and pry the victimized sausage out of the woman’s hands. She was arrested and taken into custody where she was charged with shoplifting, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. Walmart management said in no way do they tolerate this type of behavior. They have a strict policy against shoplifters and a sign on the bathroom door that clearly reads, “No merchandise allowed beyond this point.”"
1,"Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.  “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”  Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.  “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”  “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded."

1,"On 22 November 2015, the Facebook page New Yorkers posted a photograph purportedly showing a 41-lb rat caught in New York City:    41 pound rat recently caught in NYC… (via Chris Brannigan)  Although image was widely shared by various online outlets, no one provided any substantive information about the allegedly enormous rodent.  If the pictured rat were truly was “caught” in New York City, it would most likely have been a brown rat (also known as a Norway or Norwegian rat). The city is home to approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these rodents only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs. in weight.  As many commenters pointed out on in responding to the original Facebook post, the pictured animal doesn’t look like it was “caught” at all. The rat appears to be groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone’s pet. If that’s the case, this animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these rodents are a fair bit larger than the brown rat, they don’t typically grow any bigger than four pounds.  So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It’s likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (whose hands cannot be seen) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. This technique creates the illusion that what is likely just an average-sized rat appears to be much larger in the photograph.  For comparison’s sake, here’s a photograph of a 3-foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012:"
1,"Hundreds of Prince fans who lined up for hours outside Massey Hall had their hopes dashed Tuesday afternoon when promoter Live Nation confirmed on Twitter that there would be no concert that night after all.  Fans of the pop legend reported being turned away without tickets or wristbands — and no word on whether a surprise show would be scheduled for Wednesday.  “When we were told very abruptly after seven hours of waiting that ‘Prince would not be playing Massey Hall this evening’ and they were ‘taking the barricades down,’ it was quite shocking that there was no more information given,” said Rebecca Webster, a local music publicist who was near the front of the line on Tuesday.  “I don’t know who is at fault for that. When I left, there were a lot of people determined that there was a show that evening.”  Indeed, there were still some diehards lined up outside Massey Hall at 7:30 p.m. in the rain, a testament to the dedication of Prince’s fans.  In a Facebook post Tuesday night, promoter Live Nation apologized for “any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today.”  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal,” the post said. “There was no concert scheduled for today.”  A statement from 3rdeyegirl, Prince’s collaborating band, on Tuesday evening added: “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances . . .  “We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  But it was 3rdeyegirl that helped cause the commotion to begin with. Social media had picked up on the rumour early Tuesday morning after the band issued a cryptic tweet with Toronto spelled backwards: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING. . . ”  The tweet was quickly deleted around 8:30 a.m., but not before it spread like wildfire online.  Many posted on social media that tickets to the show would reportedly cost $10 and only the first 200 people in line would be let in. Others said there could be a pair of shows performed by Prince: one Tuesday night and another Wednesday.  Scott Morin, a 40-year-old jazz record label manager and lifelong Prince fan, said he was tipped off about the show when his Google Alerts awoke him Monday night to inform him of the 3rdeyegirl tweet.  He said he quickly mobilized a handful of friends, also Prince aficionados, and made it to the front of the Massey Hall lineup by 7:45 a.m.  “I figured there would be quite a lineup, but there were only a few people, so we lucked out,” he said while motioning to the hundreds and counting who had lined up behind him in the hours after.  Rebecca Webster had made it to Massey Hall at 8 a.m. to find herself fourth in line. She and her friends figured the rumours were plausible.  “The venue (Massey Hall) was available, the artist was nearby (New York) and the style of the announcement was very in keeping with how he likes to do things,” she said. “When we arrived there was full security detail and barriers set up. So we waited.”  And waited. And waited.  Webster says she often works with high-profile touring artists.  “I’ve managed guest lists for ‘surprise shows’ and most of the time they are kept fairly secret within the own artist camps as everyone has a hard time keeping a secret. What I’m saying is, it’s not an easy task to execute this kind of thing.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  Morin noted that this wouldn’t have been the first time Prince played a secret show.  In February last year, the performer played two consecutive surprise sets at the Electric Ballroom in London, England, and in British folksinger Lianne La Havas’s home.  Those shows were also sparked by a cryptic tweet from 3rdeyegirl.  With files from Ben Rayner  Read more about:"
1,"In the film Fight Club, groups of bored men led by Brad Pitt were depicted meeting up in secret to take part in bare knuckle brawls.  But a new web-based application promises to make such fights a reality by pitting violent strangers against each other.  Described as a Tinder for Fight Club, Rumblr allows users to arrange impromptu fights based on their location.  Rumblr has been described as 'Tinder for Fight Club' (left). It allows users to upload pictures of themselves along with a short profile so they can challenge other users and arrange to meet them for a fight (right)  It features a chat function to allow opponents to trash talk each other and an interactive map showing where fights are happening so others can go along to watch.  According to the app creator's website: 'Rumblr is an app for recreational fighters to find, meet, and fight other brawl enthusiasts nearby.  IS THE RUMBLR APP LEGAL? People using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries. Fighting in a public place is classed as disorderly conduct while arranging a fight to be attended by an audience could be considered an unlawful public assembly. In some areas seriously injuring someone in a fight can result in criminal charges even if the other person does not seek to press charges. In response to questions from MailOnline, the app's developers did warn that some users may risk prosecution if they used the app to arrange a fight. They said: 'Depending on where they fight, they may be. Regulations are different for every municipality and governing body.' They added, however, that those who criticised the app for encouraging violence were 'not open minded enough about the community we are providing value to'. Advertisement  'You don't need to fight to use Rumblr.  'With Rumblr Explore, anyone can browse and attend fights close by that other Rumblr users have arranged - all for free.'  The app was initially due to be released on Apple's App Store, but was rejected.  Apple has strict rules about apps that encourage violence or result in physical harm.  Instead the app will be released as a web app, and it has already attracted more than 300,000 people from around the world.  Speaking to MailOnline, Rumblr's developers Matt Henderson and Jack Kim, said: 'We've been recreational fighters our entire lives and were tired of the inefficiencies that exist when trying to find someone to fight.  'Rumblr alleviates the trouble fighters have when searching for suitable opponents.  'We were actually rejected by Apple's App Store so we have decided to transition Rumblr into a public, globally accessible web application.'  The web app is due to be launched at at 5pm EST (10pm GMT) today.  According to the developers, it works by allowing users to build a profile of themselves, including statistics about their weight and ability.  The 1999 film Fight Club, starring Brad Pitt (pictured), showed groups of bored men meeting up at underground gatherings to fight each other. Rumblr aims to overcome some of the difficulties faced by real life 'recreational fighters' when looking for someone to challenge  Rumblr includes a chat feature that allows users to challenge each other, lay down insults and make arrangements for a brawl (left). They can then broadcast these details so they appear on a map (right), allowing other users to see fights that are happening in their area  The app uses these to match fighters together who are nearby, but it also allows users to challenge each other based on their profile picture.  It encourages the fighters to lay down a challenge by 'telling your match what you don't like about their picture'.  When a challenge is accepted, the users can arrange a time and location before broadcasting the final details to attract a cloud.  .@Capn_CoolChris Rumblr will be available as a web application at https://t.co/tcYjoatwH7 Monday, Nov. 9th at 5:00 PM EST. 👊 — Rumblr (@rumblrapp) November 9, 2015  WHY BOYS WITH BEARDS ARE BAD They may have become to the go-to fashion accessory for men, but those with beards are more likely to be sexist, get into fights, cheat on their partners and steal, two new studies have revealed. The first of the two surveys, which involved 500 men aged between 18 and 72 from India and the US, studied men with nine facial hairstyles varying in length - from light stubble to a heavy beard. The group was asked to pick one that best matched their own facial hair and were then asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements about gender roles. The results revealed that 86 per cent of Indian men and 65 per cent of American men had facial hair, and those with beards of any length agreed more with hostile sexist statements than men without any facial hair. Advertisement  Fights are shown on a map and can be filtered to see those nearby, those involving women - called RumblrHER - and group fights.  According to Daily News, an email to those who registered for early access also reportedly claimed to be giving away ten pairs of golden brass knuckles to ten people who tweet about the app.  However, those using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries.

1,"0  WASHINGTON, D.C. –  As it turns out, the Republicans may have been right all along, and President Obama is not the smartest person in the room after all. Since Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, all presidents have been given an IQ test at some point during their time as leader. Gerald Ford always held the record for lowest score, with a 111, which is considered just slightly above average. On the other end of the spectrum, George W. Bush scored a 132, which is considered ‘gifted.’ Two-Thirds of people who take the standardized IQ test score between 85-115.  The White House today spun President Obama’s 102 as a ‘solid average’ that is nothing to be ashamed of.  ”President Obama never claimed to be smarter than anybody else. As a matter as fact, he has always represented himself as a regular guy, ‘a man of the people,’ as it were,” said Josh Earnest, White House Press Secretary. “The key to being a good leader is to surround yourself with smart people, which President Obama has always done. As far as needing to be a genius to run the country, well – George W. Bush had the highest score ever, and look at how that mess turned out. So, the next time President Obama bypasses congress with an executive order, and you’re about to say something cruel, racist, or otherwise completely ignorant, remember that he’s just a regular guy getting things done for you. And hey! At least he’s in the triple digits!”  “Ha! I knew it! King Obama is just a few points away from being a dummy,” said Senator Ted Cruz. ”Einstein was a 160, and guess what America – I scored 145! I’m smarter than 99% of you! When I’m elected President, I’ll bring some common sense and smarts back into the White House. Let’s face it, don’t you want your President to be smarter than the guy asking you whether you want to ‘super size’ your fries at the drive through? ‘Vote for me America, I’m smart!’ Hell, I think I’ll make that a bumper sticker!”  0  Comments  comments"

You don’t have to be deprived of the beautiful and womanly occurrence of menstruation merely because you were born without uterus. The Fem-Flo’s cotton core contains a small, vegetable-based capsule which upon reaching body temperature releases the “menses” contained within. It also aids in keeping the post-op canal conditioned and dilated after surgery and beyond.”  Although United Media Publishing‘s web site doesn’t feature a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, earlier articles from that outlet include a false claim that Charles Manson had died in prison and another fabricated story about Christian couples “divorcing en masse” in protest of same-sex marriage.  Interest in the transgender tampons claim peaked on 9 July 2015, when Twitter and Internet forum posters said that radio host Rush Limbaugh had discussed the article on his show. Some tweets suggested that Limbaugh was initially unaware of the article’s satirical nature, though no transcript of the portion of the show in question was available for review to document that assertion:  @rushlimbaugh just pushed a fake story about transgender tampons, realized it during commercial break and tried to play it off. #FAIL — John Harris (@YahyaJohn) July 9, 2015  A Google search for “Sappho-Luxe” returned results solely for the original fake news article and content based upon it.

1,"(CNN) In Hollywood, there's no better magnet for stargazing than a movie premiere. So on a Sunday afternoon in late June, the summer sun couldn't keep thousands of fans from lining Hollywood Boulevard, hoping to spot a star.  This was the ""Terminator Genisys"" premiere , and only one star mattered: Arnold Schwarzenegger . The former governor of California shook hands, signed autographs and posed for selfies. It's the kind of personal attention Fred and Kathy Santos wish they could get from Schwarzenegger , who they say stole justice from their dead son.  ""He plays a hero in the movies, yet in real life he's not a hero,"" Fred Santos said. ""He's a dirty politician.""  Minutes before ending his two terms as governor, Schwarzenegger issued his final act: Commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing to death the Santos' son, Luis, in 2008.  It's not that a governor issuing clemency was anything new. But neither the Santos family nor San Diego County prosecutors had any idea it was coming, let alone got a chance to plead their case. Instead, they were informed by a news release and a phone call from a reporter.  ""My son (was) stabbed in the heart when he was alive,"" Fred Santos told CNN. ""Schwarzenegger stabbed him in the back after my son is killed.""  At first, Fred Santos asked himself why the governor would care about their case. But deep down he knew. Santos feared political influence from the beginning -- ever since learning that Esteban Nunez wasn't just any accused killer.  He was the son of Fabian Nunez, California's most powerful Democrat and a political ally to the governor. So to many, such as San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, Schwarzenegger's surprise commutation appeared as if Nunez was cashing in.  ""I think it was political cronyism at its worst.""  The speaker's son, a brutal crime  When Fabian Nunez was sworn in as speaker of the California Assembly in 2004, his son was by his side. At 15, Esteban Nunez appeared baby-faced and shy -- nothing like the muscular, tattooed adult described in court records just four years later.  It was October 2008, and prosecutors alleged that Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were fueling their anger with alcohol. They had just been denied entry to a fraternity party near the campus of San Diego State University (neither were students there), and they were looking for revenge. The Sacramento natives were going to show them how it was done ""in Sac town,"" the pair boasted, according to court records.  ""They decided they were going to either burn a frat house or they were going to stab some people,"" Dumanis said.  Armed with knives, they walked the streets at 2 a.m. until they encountered Luis Santos and a friend. After an initial altercation, Luis called several more friends who ran to his aid.  ""It was a melee basically, where two of the boys were stabbed. One went into an induced coma,"" Dumanis said. ""Luis was stabbed, and one got smashed in the eye.""  ""My boy's dying, my boy's dying,"" Luis' friend screamed to a 911 dispatcher.  ""Stay awake Luis, stay awake,"" another friend sobbed.  A knife pierced the left ventricle of Luis' heart. He died at the scene.  Later that same night, Nunez, Jett and two others piled into a car and headed north to Sacramento. Surveillance video at a 7-Eleven captured Jett and Nunez leaving the store with a Big Gulp cup. They filled it with $1.30 worth of gasoline and used it to burn their weapons and bloody clothes, throwing the items into the Sacramento River and agreeing to never speak of the incident.  But witnesses helped police identify four suspects, and two of them weren't so quiet. The pair fingered Nunez and Jett as the stabbers, later getting probation in exchange for their testimony.  Two months after getting a phone call that their son was dead, the phone rang again at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. Their son's alleged killers were behind bars, and a reporter had a question: What was their reaction to the son of Fabian Nunez being arrested for Luis' murder?  ""My concern was that politics might interfere with justice in the legal system,"" Fred Santos told CNN.  Though assured the system would not bend to politics, Santos says he grew up in Asia, where ""politicians are dirty.""  ""I asked if the judge was a Democrat,"" he said, believing Fabian Nunez's power in that party would influence the case.  The judge was a Republican. In time, however, the judge would become the least of Santos' worries.  Foes to friends  By the time Esteban Nunez was charged with murder, his father had already derailed Arnold Schwarzenegger's early years in office. The Republican governor tried to bypass Nunez and the Democrats by calling for too many special elections on pet projects, with failing results.  ""I got to tell you, things are very sloppy here on the first floor,"" Nunez once told reporters, referring to the governor's office.  Schwarzenegger returned the jab in private conversations that were recorded and later released to news organizations.  ""Fabian is too much a political operator,"" he told his staff, apparently unaware of the recording. ""Not so much passion about specific things he stands for.""  But with his policies stalling in Sacramento, Schwarzenegger announced a shift in strategy in a State of the State address, conceding his mistakes and pledging to work with Nunez and the Democrats. The tactic proved beneficial for both sides. The pair stood side-by-side when California passed legislation creating the highest minimum wage in the nation, one of many victories out of a newly minted political friendship.  In 2008, though, Schwarzenegger did not publicly get involved in Nunez's personal problems. Instead, with his son facing a first degree murder charge and fighting for a lower bail amount, Fabian Nunez called on his Democratic friends to vouch for the credibility of his son. A union leader, a retired assemblyman and even then-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa submitted letters to the judge.  On official mayoral stationery, Villaraigosa wrote that Esteban had shared meals at his home and that he was ""a young man of good and upright character.""  ""They already have the mayor trying to influence the judge,"" Fred Santos said. ""Nobody in power was speaking (for us). We're just regular folks.""  The deal  In 2010, Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were moments away from their murder trial. A first degree conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. A second degree conviction, 15 to life.  But then, with jury selection already underway, came the next twist in this case: a plea deal for Nunez and Jett. If the pair pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, they would face a maximum of 16 years behind bars. For the Santos family it sounded too brief, but would offer swift justice and an end to years of future pain.  ""So we will not be spending the rest of our lives going to court ... listening to them fight their appeal if they were convicted,"" Fred Santos said.  For District Attorney Dumanis, a plea bargain also removed, in her mind, the only impediment to an otherwise airtight case: proving who actually stabbed Luis.  Witness testimony pointed to Jett as Luis' killer, while Nunez stabbed two other boys who survived. Was that enough to pin first- or second-degree murder on Esteban Nunez? The question no longer needed an answer when all sides agreed to a deal. Nunez and Jett pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.  ""I couldn't believe we were giving this case away,"" said Rick Clabby, then deputy district attorney, in an interview with CNN.  Now retired, Clabby believes the evidence was strong enough for at least a second-degree murder conviction.  ""We charged Nunez with conspiracy, too,"" Clabby said. ""It didn't matter if the jury couldn't decide who was the stabber.""  But Dumanis stressed the emotional toll on the victims and approved the deal.  As part of the plea, Nunez admitted that his actions led to the death of Luis Santos. Both Nunez and Jett were sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison.  Calling it ""bitter satisfaction,"" the Santoses thought their son's newly confessed killers would go away quietly and pay for their crimes, content with the plea deal they had just reached.  ""Had I known what was going to happen,"" said Dumanis, ""that (deal) never would have been an agreement.""  The governor's final act  On January 2, 2011, six months after their son's convicted killers were sent to prison, the phone rang at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. It was another reporter.  ""That's been the story of our life, a reporter calls the house and gives me information,"" said Kathy Santos.  This time, she was told of the surprise commutation and immediately went online for more information.  ""There was Esteban's face,"" she said, ""with a little blurb about Arnold's dirty deed.""  Minutes before leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced the commutation in an emailed news release. Esteban Nunez's sentence had been cut in half. He would be eligible for release in April of 2016.  ""I was so disgusted,"" Kathy Santos said. ""Esteban has been coddled, he hasn't had to be accountable because apparently his father has gotten him off.""  Fabian Nunez has publicly denied he forced Schwarzenegger into granting a favor, but he also wasn't complaining. Nunez has repeatedly maintained that his son got a raw deal because he was related to a powerful lawmaker.  ""From the beginning, my son was the headliner in the case,"" Nunez told CNN affiliate KCRA in 2011. He declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview, but after an initial version of this story aired on television, Nunez spoke to CNN over the phone.  ""This has gone from aiding and abetting to him being labeled a killer,"" Nunez said of his son.  He argues that comments from the Santos family, their attorneys and the district attorney's office have boiled the case down to a convenient narrative: Esteban Nunez accepted a plea deal, then had it cut in half because of the influence of his father. In reality, Fabian Nunez told CNN, ""the case is more complicated,"" and that his son sought clemency to right wrongs perpetrated on them by an ""overzealous district attorney"" and a ""conservative judge.""  ""My son did not want to take the deal"" if it meant he had to accept 16 years behind bars, Nunez said. ""He was going to go to trial"" and defend his position that Esteban was not nearly the aggressor that the prosecution was making him out to be.  ""This was a fight among a large group"" of people, Fabian Nunez said, adding that the two suspects who were given probation in exchange for their testimony ""were just as responsible as my son.""  In a letter to the court objecting to the sentence, Fabian Nunez claims the judge overreached in giving Esteban the full 16 years because his son, unlike Jett, ""had no criminal record"" and that Esteban ""did not harm Mr. Santos,"" referring to the witness who claimed Jett inflicted the fatal blow.  Fabian Nunez went on to claim his son was misled by the judge, who ""told us that (he) would treat Esteban differently"" from Jett.  ""He told the attorney one thing in chambers, then went into open court and said another,"" Fabian Nunez told CNN.  Prosecutors maintain they warned Esteban in open court that he could receive 16 years.  The judge denied that he made conflicting statements and refused to reconsider the sentence.  Esteban Nunez and his attorneys continued their fight until December 6, when they submitted a motion to end their appeal.  Less than a month later, Nunez received clemency.  ""I believe Nunez's sentence is excessive,"" wrote Schwarzenegger in his commutation letter, citing the lack of criminal history and the inability to prove that Nunez actually stabbed Luis Santos.  ""It was a complete betrayal of a system of justice and fairness,"" said Dumanis, the district attorney, who questions whether Nunez even submitted a clemency application to the governor. Nunez's attorney, Charles Sevilla, told CNN he did but refused to release it.  Upon his exit, Schwarzenegger ordered all clemency files sealed for 25 years. (That's not necessarily unusual. Schwarzenegger's predecessor, Gray Davis, did the same thing.)  In his only comment about the case, Schwarzenegger told Newsweek, ""There's criticism out there. I think it's just because of our (Fabian Nunez) working relationship and all that. It maybe was kind of saying, 'That's why he did it.' Well, hello! I mean, of course you help a friend.""  Fabian Nunez told CNN he was told by Schwarzenegger that the comments were ""taken out of context."" Still, the Santos family attorney, Nina Solarno, was outraged.  ""He took a political favor and played God, and took justice away from this family,"" claimed Solarno, who is also a board member for the advocacy group Crime Victims United.  In a private letter to the Santos family, Schwarzenegger wrote: ""I recognize that the last minute nature of my final acts as Governor provided you no notice, no time to prepare for or absorb the impact of this decision. For that, I apologize.""  It was an apology the Santos family would not accept.  Taking on the Terminator  While Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Hollywood in 2011, Fred and Kathy Santos returned to court. Along with the San Diego County district attorney, they filed suit alleging Gov. Schwarzenegger violated ""Marsy's Law,"" which mandates that victims' families be given a right to speak in all proceedings related to their case.  It was the last chance Dumanis had to keep Esteban Nunez behind bars and repair the damage from what she considered a tremor shaking the entire system.  ""When a governor commutes a sentence in such a flagrantly political way, it puts everybody in the system on notice that their (deals) are not safe,"" Dumanis said.  While agreeing Schwarzenegger's move was ""grossly unjust"" and ""deserving of censure,"" two separate judges concluded that it was not illegal and that ""Marsy's Law"" applied to parole hearings, not executive clemency.  Schwarzenegger, for now, had won. But both the Santoses and San Diego prosecutors were not giving up.  They succeeded in changing the state law, which now requires California governors to give victims and prosecutors at least 10 days of notice before issuing clemency. That will ensure Luis Santos' case isn't repeated, but it won't keep Esteban Nunez from being released.  While the Santos family will next petition the state Supreme Court, they know time is running out.  ""Esteban is going to be out before we get to the Supreme Court,"" Solarno conceded. ""Now we want an acknowledgment that the family's rights were taken from them, that they should have been heard, and that from this day forward your case is setting precedent that other victims are going to be heard.""  Arnold Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN's requests for a formal interview, but when questioned by CNN at the ""Terminator Genysis"" premiere in June, he would not speak about the case.  ""Since we're here today for the movie promotion, we talk movies,"" he said.  ""That's the type of person he is,"" said Fred Santos. ""He thinks somebody being murdered -- it's news that is below his status.""  ""I get their pain,"" Fabian Nunez said, adding that his attempt to reach out to the Santos family wasn't accepted. ""I get to see my son, they don't get to see theirs ... but I make no apologies for fighting for justice for my son.""  For Rick Clabby, the vocal former prosecutor, the Santos family has been victimized too many times in this case.  ""They were victimized when their son was murdered, they were victimized when our office made this stupid decision and they were victimized when the governor buddied up with Mr. Nunez,"" Clabby told CNN.  But Fred and Kathy Santos say they'll continue to fight. They're not sure where it will lead them, but they know they have to keep trying.  ""We weren't there to protect Luis, to prevent him from being killed,"" Fred Santos said. ""This is the only thing we can do for him."""
1,"News 8 – A disturbing report is coming out of that Baton Rouge, Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors who reportedly starved her children nearly to death. The 27-year-old mother of 7 was arrested on Thursday evening when neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door, they were greeted by three-year-old Amonte Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who let them into the home. Authorities say they found the Lakisha Connors passed out on the couch.  “The house was disgusting, probably the worst I’ve ever seen,” said police chief Ronnie Hernandes. “When we enter the home, we found seven children who looked extremely malnourished. In addition to that there was a lock on the refrigerator and all nonperishable foods were locked in a huge wooden makeshift storage container in the mother’s bedroom.”  Neighbors say that Connors moved into this rental home about six weeks ago.  “Lakisha just moved in not too long ago. This was the first time I had ever seen any children!” said a neighbor who wishes to stay anonymous. “But we see her almost every day coming into the house with groceries. So for her children to be starting like that was absolutely shocking!”  Authorities on the scene say when Lakisha was awoke by the police, she was very combative. “We pulled her up off the couch and asked her to explain herself,” said Hernandes. “When asked why her children were in this condition, Lakisha plainly said, without any remorse, ‘There was only enough food for me! Them kids get on my nerves. But they eat, they eat my scraps. I’m a big girl I need more than them!'”  The 7 children, whose ages range from 1 to 11 years of age, were taken into protective custody by Child Protective Services.  Lakisha is currently being held on a $500 bond."
1,"UPDATE: KIRO-7 has done a great job following up on this story  7-Eleven sent a new statement from its corporate office in Dallas. It reads:  “It’s clear that a misunderstanding occurred at a franchised 7-Eleven store. We understand that a customer presented a military ID as a form of identification when buying age-restricted products, and the Franchisee’s store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, was required to ask to see a second form of ID with a birthdate. After the customer’s age was verified, the transaction was completed. Serving members of the military, being named a top military-friendly company and employing military veterans are great honors for 7-Eleven.”  The owner of the Redmond West Lake Sammamish Parkway 7-Eleven sent this response on Thursday, calling the incident a misunderstanding:  “We sincerely apologize for a misunderstanding that occurred at one of our stores. A customer presented a military ID as a form of identification and the store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, asked to see a second form of ID. After the customers age was verified the transaction was complete.”  Collin Brown told KIRO-TV, the clerk never stated that she could not read the date of birth on Brown’s military ID card.  Representatives from 7-Eleven corporation told KIRO-TV they planned to personally contact Collin Brown.  Collin Brown, reservist in the Army, entered his local 7/11 in Redmond, WA to buy a Slurpee and his fiancé a pack of cigarettes.  When he got to the counter he was asked for proof of age. He pulled out his military ID which has his date of birth on the back, and handed it to the cashier.  [revad1]  Brown told KIRO-7 that this is how the conversation went:  “She said, ‘You’re in the military?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘I can’t serve you.’ Honestly, I was in shock. I asked, ‘Are you serious?’ She looked at me like she was offended.”  Brown then asked why there was a problem, produced a backup ID and asked for her manager’s information.  When friends and relatives posted his tale on Facebook, it had 12,000 shares in mere days.  7/11 corporate offices replied online saying Brown’s story is “distorted,” and while they support out military what actually happened was:  “A customer presented a military ID as a form of identification and the store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, asked to see a second form of ID.”  Brown claims this is not what occurred and is asking the chain to investigate.  _______________________________  From KIRO-7  REDMOND, Wash. — A local soldier, whose story sparked a firestorm of nationwide anger on social media, says a Redmond convenience store clerk denied him service, after he showed his military ID.  Collin Brown –- who is a reservist in the Army – was purchasing cigarettes for his fiancé, and a Slurpee last Wednesday, at the 7-Eleven on West Lake Sammamish Parkway. Brown put his U.S. military ID on the counter, when the cashier asked for his proof of age. The ID clearly has his date of birth on the back and serves as legal ID.  “She said, ‘You’re in the military?’ I said, ‘Yes,’” Brown said. “She said, ‘I can’t serve you.'” Honestly, I was in shock. I asked, ‘Are you serious?’ “She looked at me like she was offended,” he said.  Brown says he asked the clerk why there was a problem as he pulled out his driver’s license to back up his military ID.  “I asked for her manager’s information and at that point I was able to make the purchase,” Brown said.

1,"By Jean-Francois Rosnoblet SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren. Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board. One of the plane's black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France's interior minister said. In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation. Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines. ""We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,"" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter. Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard. Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said. Barcelona's Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner's Siegfried at the theater. French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms. Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. ""We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,"" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters. In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: ""A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors."" It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets. It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December. SHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. ""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference. Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday. Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky. France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus. ""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground. The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in. “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a ""dark day for Lufthansa"". ""My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,"" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there. Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff. In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. ""The families knew each other,"" he told Reuters. ""The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning."" King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened. In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the ""awful tragedy"". Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

1,"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.  According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.  While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.  Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.  Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.  “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”  Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.  The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.  Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.  The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death."

1,"The most anti-woman Republican Party in American History escalated its attacks on women to deny wounded female veterans fertility treatments that would help them to have children in spite of wounds suffered while defending our country.    The Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act, a bill authored by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) that would require fertility treatment and counseling for ""severely wounded, ill, or injured"" military members or veterans, had been expected to proceed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday. But Murray said she has asked that the bill be pulled thanks to proposed amendments from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) -- including one that would have, in Tillis's words, prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from working with ""organizations that take human aborted babies' organs and sell them.""  Tillis, of course, is referring to the fraudulent and debunked video recorded in secret by other Republican operatives which claims to show Planned Parenthood officials engaged in the sale of fetal tissue. It does not matter to Tillis--or any Republican, it seems-- that the video was edited to deliberately deceive. It provides a ready excuse for Republican males to exercise control over women's bodies any way they possibly can, even if it means denying wounded women veterans the ability to have children. Republicans have seized on the altered and edited video as a bludgeon to carry on their attacks against Planned Parenthood, an organization they hate because it provides women with safe and legal family planning services, counseling, and assistance with terminating unwanted pregnancies.  In this case it's hard to tell whom Republicans hate more, women or veterans. Either way, the irony of denying women the ability to conceive by pandering to the anti-choice lobby seems to have been lost on Mr. Tillis and his Republican cohorts. To illustrate just how cynical and petty his rationale is, Tillis points to a $900 donation made by the VA to a group that he can't even identify as Planned Parenthood, as ""justification"" for blocking this funding:    Tillis cited a report by Congress' nonpartisan Government Accountability Office on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending for family planning and other health programs by six organizations, including Planned Parenthood. In a footnote, that report said the VA had spent $900 on one of the organizations, but it did not say which one had received the money.  A $900 donation, out of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is how extreme they are.  Senator Murray reacted with anger and dismay at the derailing of her legislation:    ""I know some Republicans are trying to use this latest issue as just one more opportunity to roll back the clock and take away women’s health care options,"" Murray said. ""We can have that fight. We’ve had it many times before. But don’t pull veterans into the middle of it. Don’t take something that should be above politics -- our sacred duty to our veterans -- and pull it down into the muck of petty politics. It’s not fair to veterans and their families, who have been hoping and praying for the opportunity to have children.""  Paralyzed Veterans of America is deeply disappointed to learn that S. 469, the 'Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act,' has been pulled from the Senate VA Committee markup this afternoon due to amendments that serve no function but histrionic political grandstanding. Shame on those who have placed political ideology ahead of the needs of veterans with catastrophic disabilities, particularly those with spinal cord injury or disease.  This bipartisan, critically needed legislation would lift an antiquated ban on VA providing fertility services to veterans who have incurred a severe injury to their reproductive organs. As a result of the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, many young service members have suffered grievous injuries from explosive devices that have made them unable to conceive a child naturally. While the Department of Defense does provide assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to service members, VA does not.  "
1,"On 3 September 2015, the Twitter account @banditqueen_ posted an image purportedly showing President Obama standing next to a mile 69 in Alaska. The accompanying message, “The Leader of Our Country,” was an attempt to show how Obama’s supposed juvenile sense of humor made him unfit to be President:  The photograph, however, was a digitally altered fake. The real image, taken near Exit Glacier in Alaska, was posted to the White House Instagram account on 2 September 2015 and showed President Obama posing next to a sign indicating where the boundary of the now much-receded glacier was in 1961 (coincidentally also the year of President Obama’s birth):  Markers throughout Exit Glacier show how much it’s receded over time. The impacts of climate change are real, and the people of Alaska are living with them every day. It’s never been more important for us to work together to address this challenge.  Other variations of this image have also made their way around the Internet, including one which purportedly showed President Obama posing next to a 420 mile marker:  The number 420, of course, is associated with smoking marijuana."
1,"OUTRAGE: Obama Orders Military to Stop Wearing Uniforms at Recruitment Centers to Hide from Terrorists  After last week’s terror attack on two military recruitment offices in Tennessee, Obama’s defense secretary has taken steps to stop future attacks. Has he moved to arm our soldiers? Nope. He’s ordered them to cower and hide by telling them to stop wearing their uniforms. You heard that right. Obama’s administration is demanding that soldiers stop wearing their uniforms so that terrorists won’t get mad.  Our soldiers are proud of their uniforms. But obviously Obama thinks our solders’ uniforms are just “triggers”for terrorists. This is an outrage.  According to the Military Times, Obama’s weak-kneed Defense Secretary Ash Cater approved the decree that recruiters should take off their uniforms while performing their recruitment duties from now on. …now soldiers are supposed to die at their desks and now don’t even have the benefit of dying in the uniform of their country! Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet And let’s not even mention that recruiting without a uniform proudly worn by a recruiter puts a serious dent in the whole emotional appeal of recruiting and will make the recruiter’s job harder. One of the whole aspects of being recruited is that potential recruits have a visceral reaction to the crisp, flashy uniform worn by their guide to the service. It’s part of the whole package to be able to show recruits how handsome, or how sharp and orderly they will look in their own uniforms when they get one. And now Obama wants to take that away from the services?  Obama wants our troops to cower in the face of the enemy. But then, he never liked our military anyway.  **UPDATE**  Now Obama says that military recruiters should just “close the blinds” on office windows to prevent terror attacks!! OUTRAGEOUS!"

1,"If you’re a long term sufferer of migraines and headaches, you’re about to hear some promising news. If you’re a lover of piercings also, this news will suit you just perfectly.  There has been a lot of claims surfacing the internet recently, regarding a daith piercing (an ear piercing that passes through the ear’s innermost cartilage fold) being the cure for those who suffer with migraines and headaches.  It’s pretty exciting for those that do suffer, considering they will no longer have to rely on painkillers, with a long term cure that will cost them under £50.  Although it sounds too good to be true, many people who have had the piercing have taken to social media to support the claims that the piercing really has given them relief from headaches.  @EbaeJordan the daith piercing is a pressure point to reduce headaches and migraines!

Might have to make an exception for one more piercing… — Alexis Modero (@alexisplague) November 5, 2015  I rlly want a daith ear piercing bc apparently they're supposed to help get rid of migraines/headaches — reagan (@canadiansos) November 5, 2015  Though it has not been confirmed whether a daith piercing really is the cure to relieving migraines and headaches, it hasn’t been ruled out completely.  Dr. Thomas Cohn took to his blog http://www. mnphysicalmedicine.com to talk about the connection between the piercing and the relief of migraines.  MORE: This one-year-old girl is the first person to be cured of ‘incurable’ cancer with ‘designer’ immune therapy  He wrote: ‘Recently, some people who have received a Daith piercing have coincidentally found improvement with their migraine headaches. It is not universal, and it is has not been studied formally.’  ‘If a person enjoys ear piercing and suffers from frequent headaches, it may be worthwhile to consider getting this spot pierced. Since body piercings are generally less than $100, this may be a very economical treatment alternative.’  HOW CAN 'DAITH' PIERCINGS HELP RELIEVE A MIGRAINE? The theory that daith piercings help ease migraines is based on the idea that it is the same pressure point as that targeted by acupuncturists to relieve chronic headaches Acupuncture, a therapy which began in China more than 2,000 years ago, involves placing fine needles at specific pressure points on the body’s surface.  The needles are then manipulated by a acupuncturist, either manually or electrically. It causes the blood vessels around the needle to open up and become wider, allowing for an increase in blood flow to the tissues in the immediate area. A report published in 2012 in the Archives of Internal Medicine analysed nearly 18,000 patients and doctors from eight universities and hospitals in the UK, US and Germany. The results showed in conditions including chronic headache, acupuncture was twice as effective as the drugs and exercise recommended by most doctors. The Migraine Relief Center recognises the link, albeit a unproven one, between ‘daith’ piercings and easing migraine symptoms. ‘The principle is that the piercing mimics acupuncture by hitting a pressure point, which relieves the pressure in the patient’s head,’ a blog on the website states. ‘By having it done on the same side as most migraines occur, it’s thought to help reduce the incidence of migraines in the area.’ But, it cautions: ‘At this point, the effect of daith piercings on migraine has not been officially studied so it’s difficult to determine whether there’s any truth to the claims or not.’  MORE: Have scientists just found a cure for baldness?

1,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.  Prince has performed several times in Toronto, and owned a home in Canada’s largest city when he was married to Toronto-born Manuela Testolini from 2001 to 2006.  He released his latest record, ""Art Official Age,"" in September.  Donna Grantis, a guitarist in 3rdeyegirl, is from nearby Mississauga.  With a report from CTV Toronto's Andria Case"
1,"A German man has taken a court order to give his ex-wife half of his property after their divorce somewhat literally. He has cut up his stuff, from a car down to an iPhone, with power tools. He’s now selling his share on eBay.  The identity of the divorced man is unknown, but he goes by the name “Der Juli” online. He posted a YouTube video for a Laura, presumably his former wife, thanking her for “12 beautiful years” together and saying she had earned half of the household. He also claims that his ex was unfaithful.  An iPhone, a flatscreen TV and even an Opel Corsa are all meticulously sawn in half in the video. The man in the clip appears to be the handling power tools quite professionally.  The halves “Der Juli” considers rightfully his are currently for sale on eBay. A total of 16 items are offered. Buyers in need of half a teddy bear, half a bicycle or half a vinyl record of R.E.M. album “Automatic for the People” should keep in mind that shipping is only available in Germany.  Each item has a humorous if disgruntled description. The car is said to be well-preserved for its age, but have signs of wear. “In particular, half is missing,” it says. Of the bed, “Der Juli” writes that, unlike his ex, he cannot say anything bad about it. A set of four half-chairs, he believes, would make a good art installation. And the half-DVD of a German nighttime comedy show he’s selling contains the best sketches, he says.  One of the items is half a motorcycle helmet, which, “Der Juli” says, offers good visibility on the right side. The semi-protective gear is on the head of a tanned man, who appears to be in his 40s, his eyes painted over to make recognition difficult. Presumably, it’s the eponymous seller himself.  It’s not clear whether the divorce story is true or just a hoax. The video has scored over 3.3 million views since its publication on Tuesday, so one way or another, “Der Juli” seems to have made his point.  Splitting everything literally in half is not as uncommon in divorces as you might think.  In 2008, a 76-year-old Serbian farmer, married for 45 years, used a grinding machine to cut in half his farm tools and machines to comply with a court ruling to share the household goods with his ex. He was still thinking about how to split the cow, reports said."

1,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner. NBC News terrorism analyst Evan Kohlmann, added that it was frequently used by Jabhat Al-Nusra and other armed Islamist groups in the region — but not ISIS.

The hostage incident comes after police carried out a series of major anti-terrorism raids throughout Sydney in September.

1,"A petition addressed to Adele, President Obama, and Billboard on Change.org demands that the singer admit that she has “little talent” and is succeeding mainly because of her white privilege.  “Adele sold over 3.38 million copies of her album ‘25′ and the media is praising her as if Adele’s success has everything to do with talent,” reads the petition, written by Rhianna Jones.  Advertisement  “Rather, it’s her white privilege that has put her on top,” it declares.  The petitioners also “demand that Adele donates her money to African-American causes such as #Blacklivesmatter.”  It’s not clear why exactly the petition is also addressed to President Obama — perhaps Ms. Jones is outraged that the leader of the free world hasn’t pushed the less important issues like ISIS aside to deal with the more serious ones like a singer’s being white and successful at the same time. (I mean, would an executive order requiring Adele to admit she is only successful because she is white and give away her money to people who are not white in order to stay in the country really be too much to ask?)  #share#Honestly, Adele is an interesting target for this kind of criticism. First of all, despite the fact that some might think this would be impossible for a white person, Adele actually had a pretty tough upbringing: Her father was an admitted drunk who walked out on the family when she was just three years old. Second — white or not — hardly anyone thinks of Adele as having the typical look of a successful female performer. Whether someone is calling her fat or asking her how she manages to handle weighing more than others in her industry, any discussion of her image concerns how different she looks and how tough it must be to look that way.  #related#Although Jones’s petition had just 31 supporters at the time of publication, its very existence is ridiculous enough — and for so many reasons. After all, even if Adele did have a privileged upbringing and was a size 0 with D-cups, saying that she has just “a little talent” is objectively wrong. “A little talent” is the kind of phrase you use to describe someone who had the best voice in the high-school choir before going on to realize she needed to get a real job. Fan or not, anyone with ears and the ability to know what words mean would have to admit that Adele falls into a different category."
1,"Middle Eastern men purchased dozens of burner cell phones at Walmarts in and around Lebanon, Missouri (ostensibly to carry out terror attacks); at the same time, multiple stores reported propane tank thefts.  Ones casualities start coming in due to your blatant disregard and obvious knowing of those Muslim extremists buying those burner phones, we the people will blame you. There was more than enough reasonable suspicion to arrest those foreigners on a probable threat of terrorism. THey are not US citizens, they don't need due process like AMericans. You're just as bad as the UK police and too intimidated to do a damn thing about it! Now they are gone....and we have NO IDEA what they are planning, whether its suicide bombing or somethng else. THANKS, YOU GUYS DID A BANGUP JOB!!! You're idiots! ____________________________________________________________________________________ Published on Dec 11, 2015 www.undergroundworldnews.com The FBI has launched an investigation after 150 prepaid mobile phones were bought from local Walmarts in Missouri. This comes after the theft of dozens oftanks in the area. The large number of purchases took place at six Missouri Walmarts at least, authorities say, according to KRCG13.  You won't hear this on the news! Lebanon, MO #walmart #muslims enter at 4:30 am and try to buy 60 cellphones. #WakeUpAmerica  A large portion of the phones were bought by “three men with accents” at one Walmart near the town of Lebanon,... https://t.co/L4KP94rUYD  Law enforcement has linked the cell phone purchases or stolen propane tanks to each other and/or terrorists.  Police investigated reports of large cell phone purchases in several Missouri Walmarts; the county sheriff's office later confirmed that the reports were unrelated to terrorism.  On or around 5 December 2015, rumors began circulating on social media regarding a large purchase of pre-paid cell phones at a Walmart in Lebanon, Missouri, which later included similar suspicious purchases at other Walmarts in the area.  On 9 December 2015, mid-Missouri station KMIZ published an article reporting that law enforcement authorities in at least four Missouri cities had received reports of suspicious phone purchases at area WalMart stores:  [S]omeone tried to buy a suspicious number of phones at Wal-Mart East in Jefferson City. The latest report is in addition to three other reports of similar incidents in Columbia, Macon and Lebanon. Authorities in all four cities said they had contacted FBI agents. However, the FBI only confirmed it is investigating three of those reports.  The reports described by KMIZ were attributed to Walmart employees and an eyewitness who wished to remain anonymous, and they described two men who had purchased 60 phones at the Lebanon WalMart:  [We] talked to a witness who didn’t want to be identified said the men paid with cash. “Right then and there I knew there was not something adding up about this. It’s not right, it doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “Who’s going to order 50 phones for Christmas? Who does that?” The man who saw the phones being purchased in Columbia said he instantly thought the men were up to no good. “That’s the first thing that ran through my mind that something bad could happen,” he said. “You know, they could be using these phones for terrorist acts.”  We contacted the Lebanon Police Department to gather additional information, but the individual with whom we spoke directed us to the FBI’s local field office for more information. A police report [PDF] available on the jurisdiction’s web site indicated that police were summoned to the Lebanon Walmart in the early hours of 5 December 2015. The report didn’t indicate who made the report (whether it was a bystander or employee), what the suspicious activity in question was (aside from the purchase of unspecified electronics), nor that the incident was viewed as suspicious by the officer:  On Saturday December 5, 2015 at approximately 0352 hours I was dispatched to 1800 S. Jefferson in reference to suspicious activity regarding electronics purchasing. Upon my arrival, I made contact with two male subjects that were pointed out by store employees. Upon speaking the two males, it was determined that there was no further reason to detain the subjects and they were allowed to leave. Nothing further at this time.  Social media users excoriated local law enforcement agents for not detaining the men, but the police report explicitly stated that there was no lawful reason to do so.  Altogether, five similar incidents were reported at WalMart stores in Columbia, Jefferson City, Macon, Jackson, and Lebanon. Missouri law enforcement officials alerted the FBI after a small number of men bought more than 100 pre-paid cellphones from WalMart stores in three different cities over a 24-hour period.  Macon County sheriff’s Detective Curt Glover said that although law enforcement were called to investigate the purchases, no arrests were made in connection with them because no laws had been broken:  “There’s no violation of criminal law, as far as we’re aware,” Glover said. “They can go to a retail store and buy as many items as they wish. But when they buy a high number of one item most people wouldn’t buy, it’s cause for suspicion.” An FBI spokeswoman in Kansas City, Missouri, Bridget Patton, said it is not uncommon for local law enforcement to contact that federal agency if they deem something suspicious. Patton would not say if the FBI is formally investigating. Prepaid cellphones, popular among international travelers and consumers with poor credit, also are commonly used by drug dealers and gang members because they don’t require personal data be given to the seller or service provider, masking the user’s identity. Such phones also have been linked to suspected terror activity including by a man accused of plotting to bomb Times Square in 2010 and using a prepaid phone to communicate with co-conspirators in Pakistan.  An iteration of the rumor held that reported thefts of propane tanks might (unspecifically) be related to the cell phone purchases. On 11 December 2015 the web site BuzzPo reported that:  The FBI is on alert to a possible terrorist plot after dozens of propane tanks were stolen, and about 150 pre-paid cell phones were purchased by ‘three men with accents.’ … If that’s not enough, the U.S. Air Force reported that two Afghan students from Georgia missing as well. Obviously, the missing Georgia Air Force students aren’t necessarily connected to the stolen propane and purchased cell phones. But in light of recent events, it shouldn’t necessarily be ruled out either.  However, that claim came one day after a 10 December 2015 report from Kansas City station WDAF that both addressed and countered speculation that the missing propane tanks were a likely sign of imminent terror attacks:  Now, another incident has some people wondering if we are in danger of a terrorist attack in our area. A large number of propane tanks have been reported stolen from several locations is Independence and Lee’s Summit … At the end of November, a BP gas station in Lee’s Summit reported 18-20 propane tanks stolen from the outside cages. That same night the CVS on Southwest 3rd Street reported the exact same crime. While there are several ways those tanks and cell phones phones can be used, in this climate, terror attacks are always a consideration. Retired FBI agent Michael Tabman says it is up to law enforcement to investigate and try to connect the dots. “Certainly, we hear something about gas being stolen we worry about a potential bomb. The good news is this is probably not part of terrorist planning for a number of reasons,” Tabman said. “One is they wouldn’t steal these items because they know that would attract law enforcement’s attention. Also this would not be a tool of choice,” he continued.  On 11 December 2015, the Macon County Sheriff’s Office published a Facebook post confirming that the cell phone purchases were unrelated to terrorism. According to that post, the “cell phones [were] not believed to be purchased for use in criminal activity,” but rather “purchased in a region for a low price and shipped to another region and sold to the general population for a large profit”:"

The masked, Kalashnikov-toting shooters moved with military precision, and then escaped following the 11:30 a.m. attack at Charlie Hebdo, the publication known for challenging Muslim terrorists with a 2011 caricature of Prophet Muhammed on its cover and which recently tweeted a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and were being sought.

Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.  One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.  All three remain at large.  Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.  “We’ve avenged the honor of the prophet!” the killers shouted, according to witnesses who spoke to Sky News.

Hollande added that the publication had been threatened in the past and was already under police protection and surveillance.  “This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,” Hollande told reporters.  Officials said the men walked into the ground floor of the publication's offices and began shooting before making their way up to the first floor. Cartoonist Corine Rey, aka “Coco,” told the weekly Humanité that she let the men inside the building of Charlie Hebdo after being ordered at gunpoint.  “They spoke perfect French,"" said Rey, who said the rampage lased about five minutes. ""They said they were Al Qaeda.”  Related Image Expand / Contract The video still image shows the blurred-out image of a Paris police officer being shot by the fleeing gunmen. (Sky News)  Witnesses said the attack was carried out commando-style, with the gunmen demanding the names of those they encountered, indicating that they had specific targets in mind.  “It was a real butchery,” Rocco Contento, a spokesman for the Unité police union, told The Guardian.  Benoit Bringer, a journalist from the agency Premieres Lignes Tele, whose offices are next door, told the Telegraph he took refuge on the building's roof.  ""Three policemen arrived by push bike, but they left naturally as the attackers were armed,"" he said.  The publication's offices are in the trendy 11th arrondissement of Paris, which includes posh restaurants and retail shops. It is one of the most densely populated districts in all of Europe and is home to a large, mostly Algerian, Muslim community. Schools in the area were closed and newspaper offices, shopping centers, museums and stations were placed under police protection.  Charlie Hebdo first gained notoriety in 2006, when it reprinted a dozen cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that appeared in Danish daily Jyllands-Posten, in defiance of Islam's forbidding of any image attempting to portray its most important prophet. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. Nearly a year later, the magazine published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations around the Muslim world. One of the dead in Wednesday's attack was satirical cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, the publication's editorial director and the artist behind the caricatures that offended jihadists. He was the subject of a fatwah, and there is a Facebook page called ""Execute Stephane Charbonnier.""

Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, Gérard Biard, escaped the attack because he was in London. He expressed his shock and said the magazine had had no specific threats of violence.  Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, told The Associated Press another cartoonist named Jean Cabut, known by the pen name Cabu was killed. Other reports said cartoonists Georges Wolinski and Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac were killed.  A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said one of the two police officers killed was one assigned as Charbonnier's bodyguard after prior death threats against him.  Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced death threats after several newspapers published his images of Muhammad, recently presented Charlie Hebdo with his ""Gold Dog"" prize, said the attack, in spite of security for Charlie Hebdo staffers, shows it is ""impossible to guard [them] when it comes to attackers armed to the teeth.""

They were all at one point members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the administration considers a “moderate” political organization.  But a new bill to push back against the failure to classify the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization has come before Congress.  Advertisement - story continues below  On Tuesday, lawmakers in both houses of Congress filed legislation that would formally designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a sanctioned terrorist organization.  According to the Washington Free Beacon, the legislation outlined the Brotherhood’s long history of sponsoring terror activities as reason why the Muslim Brotherhood should be classified as a global terror group.  This bill would force Secretary of State John Kerry to explain why the Obama administration has until now been reluctant to label the Brotherhood as anything other than what it is … a terrorist organization.  Advertisement - story continues below  A similar bill failed last year. Sen. Ted Cruz sponsored the new legislation in the Senate while Rep. Mario Diaz did he same for the House version of the bill.  “We have to stop pretending that the Brotherhood are not responsible for the terrorism they advocate and finance,” Cruz told the Free Beacon. “We have to see it for what it is: a key international organization dedicated to waging violent jihad.”  “Since the Obama administration refuses to utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ … Congress owes it to the American people to tell them the truth about this threat,” he added.

Each facility will consist of 15 smoking pods in which customers can smoke a joint, bong, or pipe without being harassed or bothered by people who are offended by it.  Each pod not only contains the marijuana smoke within it’s small space, but also it repels the smell of the marijuana through a ventilation tube above the pod. So, although the doors are sealed in this previous “Play Place” location, the smell of marijuana will not seep into the main restaurant as people enter and exit the facility.  Two restaurants in Denver, Colorado have successfully converted the play areas into a marijuana smoking section, with the other 13 franchises to complete renovations by the end of 2015. As for now, McDonald’s will not be getting into the sale of marijuana or marijuana edibles. However, they do welcome their patrons to have a smoke before ordering.  http://straightstoned.com/pro-lifers-declare-ejaculation-murder-every-sperm-cell-life/"
1,"FACT CHECK: Did a young man named Jammal Longmire threaten in a Facebook post to shoot police officers?  Claim: A young man named Jammal Longmire threatened in a Facebook post to shoot police officers.  PROBABLY FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail and Twitter, September 2015]  A friend shared a post on Facebook that shares a young man, Jammal Longmire holding 2 automatic weapons with the comment reading, Young men get your guns and kill them white ass policemen, do not think about it just do it. Call them bitches out set them up with two in the head.” I find this incredibly disturbing if it is in fact true and believe it should be reported if found to be factual. Jammal Longmire, actually a black terrorist who tweeted pictures of himself with guns wanting to kill policemen or is it a conservative scare tactic?  Outspoken #BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops #BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb — Dr. White (@RealDoctorWhite) June 10, 2015  Origins: In June 2015, a screenshot of a Facebook post began circulating on social media, featuring an image that appeared to depict a young black man named Jammal Longmire posing with two guns and issuing the above-quoted threat to police officers.  The appearance of the Jammal Longmire rumor coincided with a then-ongoing controversy over police treatment of a young black girl at a pool party in McKinney, Texas, and most likely the image was created and/or garnered more attention due to what was at the time an ongoing race-related national debate.  Purported screen captures of the post were shared to multiple social networks, with the original appearing to bear a date stamp of 8 June 2015. A version published to Facebook on 10 June 2015 was shared hundreds of thousands of times, and an 11 June 2015 tweet held that “Jammal Longmire” was an “outspoken Black Lives Matter activist” (a claim that apparently did not bear out, as we were unable to find a person of that name or likeness affiliated with the movement):    Outspoken #BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops #BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb — Dr. White (@RealDoctorWhite) June 10, 2015  The image certainly agitated social media users in a time of racial disharmony, and in subsequent months it continued to spread. Yet apparently no trace of any Jammal Longmire existed on the Internet before the rumor became popular: if Longmire was an actual young man (and prominent Black Lives Matter activist) living in America, he maintained a highly atypical non-existent profile on social media and the Internet at large. Some folks speculated that Longmire concealed his accounts from view after the post went viral, but those subsequent actions couldn’t have retroactively eradicated all traces he would have left prior to 8 June 2015.  A search for Jammal Longmire restricted to items appearing before 8 June 2015 turns up only misdated references posted after the emergence of the rumor, and we were unable to locate any other evidence pertaining to the existence of a person by that name prior to then. Not only did Longmire seem to spring into existence with a controversial claim on 8 June 2015, but the words “Jammal” and “Longmire” didn’t appear consecutively at all on the Internet before that time.  It’s possible (though rather implausible) Longmire simply created a social media presence to post the image and make the threat and then disappeared back into the ether. However, national law enforcement agencies and Daytona Beach police treated reports about the post very seriously yet failed to to locate anyone remotely matching the name or photograph seen in the viral post. (It should be noted that Orlando television station WFTV described the post as belonging to Jammal Longmire but clearly did not verify whether such an individual existed.)  FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are conducting a joint investigation into a Facebook post. Officials say the post could be fake, but Chief Mike Chitwood said he received more than 500 emails about the threats. “We have opened a joint investigation with the FBI, the ATF and the border patrol (Border Patrol?) to try and see who is behind these postings,” Chitwood said. The post, belonging to Jammal Longmire, calls for people to pick up guns and kill police officers, police said. Police said the man in the picture is holding two assault rifles. “Is this really an attack on the officers? Is this person on that Facebook really who they say they are? So that’s what the investigation is trying to show out,” Chitwood said. “Look what happened in New York City,” Chitwood said. “I mean, you have a guy coming from Atlanta that is a little unstable, gets his hand on a couple guns, doesn’t have anything to lose, so I’m just going to go up and assassinate two police officers.” Authorities said Facebook has been served a warrant for the address of the device used to make the threats.  None of the listed agencies turned up a Jammal Longmire in Daytona Beach or anywhere else. A Longmire family was located in Michigan but was deemed to be unrelated to the man in the controversial photographs. Similarly, the educational institution whose name appeared on the shirt worn by the man in the photographs (North Carolina A&T State University) was unable to find him:    This has been investigated internally and determined that he is not one of our students. https://t.co/xNPd7BPn3b — North Carolina A&T (@ncatsuaggies) June 16, 2015  Some viewers observed that the firearms seen in the photograph were clearly corded as something being handled in a retail environment, some speculated they were attached to a video game, and others said they were secured in a fashion typically seen in gun stores. Regardless, the guns visible in the photograph clearly didn’t belong to the individual holding them and may not even have been operational.    So while Jammal Longmire has remained a focus of social media outrage since June 2015, neither local police, the FBI, nor the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) were able to locate him or his corded guns. The Longmire rumor or hoax was virtually identical to a similar racial controversy-based prank concerning a fictitious McDonald’s employee named Bubba Conroy who purportedly spat in white customer’s meals. That claim also generated significant measures of outrage on social media sites but did not hold up under scrutiny.  Last updated: 2 September 2015  Originally published: 2 September 2015"

1,"Representative Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts) points up an appalling weakness in the Homeland Security Department that won’t be fixed by the firing of these 72 employees and the resignation of the director (which director he is referring to is unclear; the DHS Secretary certainly didn’t resign). The entire culture of the Department, and the Washington establishment, needs to be changed, such that there is not a remote possibility of people who are on a terrorist watchlist getting hired at DHS. But no adequate screening procedures are in place, because they would be “Islamophobic.”  “Congressman Lynch: 72 Department of Homeland Security Employees On Terrorist Watchlist,” by Tori Bedford, WGBH, December 1, 2015:  Earlier this month, 47 democrats in the house of representatives defied a house veto threat by backing a GOP bill to ramp up screening requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Stephen Lynch was among them. He joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio to discuss the reasoning behind his vote and other congressional matters.  Questions are paraphrased, and responses are edited where noted […].  MARGERY: Let’s start with the vote on the Syrian refugees. Why were you with those 47 other democrats?  It’s a very simple bill, I know that it’s got subsumed within a larger discussion about immigration policy, but basically, the bill we voted on was a very short bill—four pages in length, basically, and it said that the director of national security shall review the vetting process as being conducted by both the FBI and the department of homeland security. Because of the disastrous results we’ve had so far with the screening process, especially the department of homeland security, I think it was a very good idea to have another set of eyeballs looking at that process.  Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.  I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process. That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time. I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status.  JIM: Even if you’re right that the system needs strengthening, the most likely way that a terrorist would come into this country is not through an 18-24 month-long process, but through this Visa program that allows 20 million people from 38 countries to come here every single year with absolutely no prior approval at all.  We had Democratic and Republican proposals on this bill, and there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two of them. It became a sort of a proxy battle over immigration. You had a bunch of Republican governors who were using it politically, and saying, “we’re going to stop refugees from coming into our state, which is baloney because they have no ability—zero ability—under the constitution to actually prevent refugees from coming into their state. You also had other people on the far left saying that this would stop every person from coming into the United States. In both cases, if they only took the time to read the bill, they would see that it did not do either. The democratic proposal also requires a multi-layered vetting process of refugees.  The reason the refugee issue came up and not the Visa waiver program is because in the Paris example, you had somebody go into the stream of legitimate refugees and then perpetrate acts of violence upon the civilians in Paris. That’s why that example came to the forefront.  I agree with you—I think the Visa waiver program, where you’ve got 20 million people coming in, versus the [refugees] coming in, 10,000? perhaps? At the end of the day, obviously the Visa waiver program is the one that we should be looking at…."
1,"Charlie Hebdo suspects among three gunmen killed as French police end hostage stand-offs in Paris and Dammartin-en-Goele  Updated  French police have killed three gunmen, including two brothers suspected of shooting dead 12 people in an attack at the Paris offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.  Cherif and Said Kouachi were at the centre of a stand-off at a printing business in an industrial area in Dammartin-en-Goele, around 40 kilometres from an area which was subject to intense police searches on Thursday.  Police stormed the building several hours after a car chase that saw shots fired. A hostage was freed unhurt. Reports suggested the gunmen came out firing when police moved in.  In a simultaneous assault, dozens of heavily armed officers stormed a kosher grocery store in eastern Paris where a gunman with links to the same Islamist group as the Kouachi brothers had taken several people hostage.  Explosions were heard shortly before television pictures showed a number of people being freed.  The gunman was shot dead and four hostages were killed. Two officers were injured as police forced their way into the store.  After police brought the sieges to an end, French president Francois Hollande called for unity and vigilance from his countrymen.  ""With the prime minister I have further strengthened the means to protect public places. But we must be vigilant. I also call upon unity because as I have expressed before... it is our best weapon,"" he said.  ""Today in a kosher supermarket it was a terrible act that was committed. The people who committed the acts, these fanatics, have got nothing to do with the Muslim religion.""  Mr Hollande has invited a number of world leaders to a ""great gathering"" on Sunday, when he has called for ""all French men and women to rise"".  Police said the gunman in the grocery store was believed to be connected to the killing of a policewoman at a metro station on Thursday and released mugshots of Amedy Coulibaly, 32, and Hayat Boumeddiene, 26.  Coulibaly knew at least one of the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo massacre, a source told French news agency Agency France-Press.  It is understood police are still searching for Boumeddiene.  The exact number of hostages in the grocery store siege was unclear, but local media reported at least five were held.  A security source said Coulibaly shot two people as soon as he entered the store, and had ""one or more bags"" of explosives with him but did not detonate them.  He had tried to boobytrap the entrance to the shop ""but had not hooked up the explosives"", the source added.  Police cordoned off the area in Port de Vincennes and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve rushed to the scene.  Reports have surfaced that Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi were known to each other and were seen together in 2010 while visiting another jihadist, Djamel Beghal, the mastermind of a failed prison break-out plot.  Coulibaly was convicted for his role in the planned break-out and was well-known to anti-terrorist police.  Two gunmen stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, armed with Kalashnikov rifles.  They shot dead eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance man and a visitor to the offices in the worst militant attack on French soil in decades.  The French government launched a massive manhunt for the suspects, deploying 88,000 soldiers and police.  Earlier, Mr Cazeneuve confirmed police had cornered the Kouachi brothers in Dammartin-en-Goele.  ""An operation is underway which is set to neutralise the perpetrators of the cowardly attack carried out two days ago,"" he said in a televised statement.  Helicopters were seen flying over an industrial zone outside the town where around 200 children from a pre-school, primary school and high school were evacuated to the town gymnasium.  Earlier, police had chased a vehicle at high speed along the A2 motorway towards Paris as authorities appeared to be closing in on the two brothers. Parts of the chase were broadcast live on TV as media vehicles followed closely behind police.  Gunshots rang out and police trucks, ambulances and armoured vehicles descended on the area close to Charles de Gaulle airport.  The Paris prosecutor denied French media reports that at least one person had been killed when the shots were fired during the car chase.  The previous night officers had focused their search on the woodland village of Corcy, not far from a service station where police sources said the brothers had been seen in ski masks.  Said and Cherif Kouachi were French-born sons of Algerian-born parents, both in their early 30s, and both were already under police surveillance.  One was jailed for 18 months for trying to travel to Iraq a decade ago to fight as part of an Islamist cell.  Police had described them as being ""armed and dangerous"".  US and European sources close to the investigation said on Thursday that Said Kouachi was in Yemen in 2011 for several months training with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the group's most active affiliates.  A Yemeni official familiar with the matter said the Yemen government was aware of the possibility of a connection between Said Kouachi and AQAP and was looking into any possible links.  US government sources said Said Kouachi and his brother were listed in two US security databases, a highly classified database containing information on 1.2 million possible counter-terrorism suspects, called TIDE, and the much smaller no-fly list maintained by the Terrorist Screening Centre, an interagency unit.  US television network ABC reported that the brothers had been listed in the databases for ""years"".  Dave Joly, a spokesman for the Terrorist Screening Centre, said he could neither confirm nor deny if the Kouachis were listed in counter-terrorism databases.

1,"According to a German media site, it is speculated that the 28 year old copilot who crashed a Germanwings flight this week had converted to Islam. Andreas Lubitz had stayed for a time in Bremen, home of the radical mosque, Masjidu-l-Furqan, where he trained at the Lufthansa Flight Training School.  Michael Mannheimer of Spiesa.com wrote:  (Translated from German)  All evidence indicates that the copilot of Airbus machine in his six-months break during his training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and subsequently either by the order of “radical”, ie. devout Muslims , or received the order from the book of terror, the Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of the investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that he – as Mohammed Atta, in the attack against New York – received his instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque. Converts are the most important weapon of Islam. Because their resume do not suggests that they often are particularly violent Muslims. Thus Germany now has its own 9/11, but in a reduced form. And so it is clear that Islam is a terrorist organization that are in accordance with §129a of the Criminal Code to prohibit it and to investigate its followers. But nothing will happen. One can bet that the apologists (media, politics, “Islamic Scholars”) will agree to assign this an act of a “mentally unstable” man, and you can bet that now, once again the mantra of how supposedly peaceful Islam is will continue. And worse still, the attacks by the left against those who have always warned against Islam, will be angrier and merciless. The Masjidu-l-Furqan Mosque was raided by the police in December 2014.  BERLIN, Dec 5 (KUNA) — German authorities have closed a mosque in the northern city of Bremen, after it was accused of encouraging youth to join the extremist Islamic State group (known as ISIL), which is carrying out violent killings across Syria and Iraq.  In unprecedented circumstances, more than 100 German police personnel carried out a search of Masjidu-l-Furqan and its accompanying cultural office, which had both been under police radar since 2007.  Other sources state that Lubvitz may have been suffering from depression as he was dealing with a break-up with his girlfriend, who has yet to be located.  Police have reportedly found an “item of significance” at the apartment of Andreas Lubitz, the First Officer who crashed the Germanwing passenger plane into the Alps. The item was NOT a suicide note.  Authorities claim they found ripped-up medical leave note(s) with the results of a urine test. They were found at this home in Dusseldorf indicated that he was “unfit for work” according to CNN and the German prosecutor Krumpf. The note was for “an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment”, according to France 24.  According to German daily Bild, Lubitz had been the recipient of a “specific and regular medical treatment” ever since his bout of depression in 2009.  He was on medication for an illness at the time of his death according to Fox news.  A website, Roman Catholic Imperialist.blogspot.com, claimed he was a convert who committed jihad. The report also claimed that Lubitz had a Muslim girlfriend, but it is unclear if she was still dating Lubitz at the time of the crash or if he met the woman through Muslims friends.  Other news media are reporting that Lubitz had broken off the relationship after he pledged to commit Jihad for Allah. They were supposed to marry next year.  Comments  comments"
1,"14-Year Old Virgin Teen In Texas Falls Pregnant After Flu Shot  San Angelo, TX – A 14-year old schoolgirl has suffered serious complications after a flu shot allegedly left the young girl terribly ill and with severe cramps, until the family doctor finally realized weeks later she had been impregnated by the vaccine, reports the Forth Worth Telegram this week.  After symptoms persisted several weeks, the distressed mother brought her child to the Whole Womans Health of Forth Worth medical clinic where she was found to be pregnant moments later.  “She was in excellent health beforehand. After a few days she became very unwell, she had all the symptoms of a fever” explains her mother. “It took a good few weeks before she felt better, but the nausea continued. She would throw up every day or so, until eventually we went to see Dr Hersch who realized she was pregnant” she told local reporters, visibly still under shock.  “She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. It’s not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents, but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy, and she urged me to check her hymen, which I eventually did, and to my utter surprise, the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm” she assures. “In my 26 years of practice, I have never heard once of such a thing as someone being impregnated by a vaccine, but I did some research and found out it is more common than most people think”.  The young girl and her family have decided to keep the baby regardless of the atypical situation. “We are devout Christians. If God made this birth possible, then who are we to judge the how or the why?” she ponders. “If Joseph and Mary had not given birth to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, where would humanity be today?” she asks, a tear in her eyes. “We will soon have a new family member within our community, and it is a gift and a blessing”.  Vaccine pregnancies: a controversial subject  “Vaccine technology is fairly recent in history so we hypothesize how they work, but as in this instance, why do some women fall pregnant from vaccines?” asks PhD student Alexa Goldberg, who is writing her doctoral thesis on the subject. “There is clearly a necessity to study this growing trend and further research is needed. The scientific community must stop avoiding this highly controversial subject. If nothing is done, this tragic situation will only repeat itself in the future” she warns.  A similar case occurred in 2013 when 11 young girls in Mexico, near the city of Juarez in the state of Veracruz, aged 11 to 17, claimed they had fallen pregnant after being given HPV shots. A moratorium was put on HPV vaccines for six months after Mexican health authorities claimed the “contaminated batch” was at the root cause of the problem.  The United Nations estimates over 4,000 people each year fall pregnant to vaccine shots, but a 2012 World Health Organization (WHO) report concludes the benefits of mass vaccination campaigns worldwide are well worth the risk.  The medical clinic where the inoculation took place firmly denies any wrong doing on their part and claims the accusations are “absurd and improbable”.  [Via WorldNewsDailyReport]"

Heightened sensitivity on both sides of the controversy led to a number of secondary kerfuffles: in its wake the Dukes of Hazzard television series was removed from TV Land‘s schedule (but not banned), and a satirical petition circulated urging Cracker Barrel to change its name to “Caucasian Barrel.” Predictably, people felt increasingly unable to determine which claims were on the up-and-up and which were simply parodies of genuine debates about symbols.  Accordingly, the recirculation a very old joke relating the picking of cotton balls from jars of over-the-counter medications (such as Tylenol pain reliever) to the picking of cotton on plantations by slaves has met a bifurcated online audience: some shared it to deliberately poke fun at what they deemed to be rampant oversensitivity, but others seemed unsure of whether it was plausibly serious given rapidly-changing standards of acceptable historical and racial discourse.  As evidenced by the multiple examples above, not everyone grasped the satirical nature of the claim about bottles of Tylenol, picking cotton, and parallels to slavery. Some social media users legitimately believed that “CNN Breaking News” had reported it as true, others stated Walmart had “banned” Tylenol. However, all claims of such a “ban” were humorous in nature, and no over-the-counter medication has been restricted in any fashion to avoid racially-related offense to consumers.

She added the hashtag #raiseyourpencilforfreedom.  On Thursday, Clerc told us that she wasn't upset about the confusion. She wrote:  This is irrelevant, I don’t want it to turn into polemic and distract people from the real issues. There are way more important things to talk about at the moment, and in the end what matters is that this image speaks to people, so the more it spreads the better it is. I am French and a woman and I was lucky enough to grow up in a free country. I never had to fight for my freedom of speech or opinion, neither for my right to be educated. This is my treasure, this is our most precious treasure. I believe in these values and so many people do just as much. I am truly devastated and all my thoughts are for the victims and their families, there are no words to express how much they will be missed. My drawing was a spontaneous reaction, I didn’t expect it would have such an echo. Ideas don’t break, ideas don’t die. Charlie became immortal yesterday and I hope that this terrible day will make us cherish and protect our freedom with even more wit and humour. I can only hope it will inspire people to use their pencils too and that there will be thousands of drawings like this very soon.  About the attack  Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, two of whom remain at large.  The gunmen, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.  Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.  Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.  The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.  Additional reporting by Mashable staff. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."
1,"At least 12 people, including four cartoonists and two policemen, killed by three gunmen at Charlie Hebdo magazine.  Three heavily armed men have attacked a French satirical magazine based in Paris, killing at least 12 people, including four cartoonists and two policemen, officials have said.  The lawyer of the magazine confirmed that four cartoonists working with the publication, including the editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as ‘Charb’, were among the dead. Police said 11 people were wounded in the incident, adding that four were in a critical condition.  The cartoonists known as Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski were also killed in the attack, AFP news agency quoted a judicial source as saying.  Charlie Hebdo has drawn repeated threats for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, among other controversial sketches.  French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the assault was carried out by three attackers.  According to witnesses, one was a driver and the other two were attackers in terms of their role in the incident, police said.  In amateur camera footage shared on the internet, the attackers are heard shouting: “We have avenged the Prophet Mohammad.”  The gunmen fled eastwards towards the suburbs, dumping their car in a residential area, police said. They then hijacked two other cars, wounded their drivers and ran over a pedestrian.  Al Jazeera’s Jacky Rowland, reporting from Paris, said journalists and cartoonists reported several masked men dressed in black entering the building who then began to fire with automatic weapons.  “Some journalists took refuge on the roof,” Rowland said.  “Charlie Hebdo has pushed boundaries in the past, and continues to challenge the idea of censorship.”  President Francois Hollande, speaking outside the office of the magazine, described the attack as having been carried out by barbaric people.  “This is an attack on free speech.” he told reporters. “No one can harm the spirit of this country which is this newspaper”.  The magazine had tweeted a cartoon of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, minutes before the attack.Rowland said that a terrorism alert has been raised to its highest level in the wake of the attack.  France’s Muslim leadership sharply condemned the shooting as a “barbaric” attack and an assault on press freedom and democracy.  “This extremely grave barbaric action is also an attack against democracy and the freedom of the press,” the French Muslim Council (CFCM) said in a statement.  The body represents France’s Muslim community, which is Europe’s biggest and estimated to number between 3.5 million and five million people.  Hollande held a cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace over the incident on Wednesday.  Huge crowds gathered in Paris and other major cities in France in a show of support for the staff of Charlie Hebdo.  Demonstrators in Paris were seen holding up banners in support of free speech, including one written, “Je suis Charlie (I am Charlie)”, a slogan that has gone viral on social media.  French authorities said that school trips and all school outdoor activities have been cancelled until further notice while the gunmen are at large.  US President Barack Obama’s spokesman said the US “condemns [the attack] in the strongest terms”.  Josh Earnest said US officials have been in close contact to assist the French in the wake of the incident.  Earnest said the French have been “stalwart allies” in the US fight against the ISIL, adding: “We know they are not going to be cowed by this terrible act.”  Various countries, including Russia, Qatar, Kuwait, Britain, Germany, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Canada, have also condemned the attack.  In a 2012 interview, Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier told Al Jazeera why the magazine is a target."
1,"In Augusta, Georgia, paramedics and police were called to 52 year old Jonas Etcher’s mobile home Tuesday night after a frantic call came from his mother saying her son had sawed off his penis with an electric carving knife.  Correction – this story has been debunked by Scopes. It didn’t actually happen.  Ellen Etcher (pictured below) talked about the incident in detail:  He’s really been struggling with masturbation. He knows it’s against Jesus, but he’s still been self-pleasuring up to a dozen times a day. He can’t seem to find a girl to get his sex urges out on… we’ve tried Match.com, Craigslist. Jonas believed he would go to hell if he didn’t stop masturbating. So he took drastic measures by cutting off what he called his ‘sinful part.’  I had told him that maybe we could have had somebody build a metal glove with razor sharp spikes on the palm and fingers that could have been permanently padlocked to his penis in order to prevent him from masturbating. But he said that would have ‘been itchy,’ so I guess he thought sawing his thing off was the better solution. I am proud of him from trying to lead a life of purity, but now he’s going to have to go on disability as he won’t be able to work at Applebee’s while he recovers.”  Doctors said he will make a full recovery but will now be required to wear a catheter and urine bag. They would normally have attempted to reattach the penis but Etcher had thrown it to a neighbour’s dog who had eaten most of it.  I’m not sure what’s a more tragic sexual story story – this or the Michigan woman who claims that she lost her virginity to a Cabbage Patch Kid."
1,"Friends Reunion 2015: Courteney Cox doesn't seem to age. The ""Friends"" star showed up make-up free at lunch in Beverly Hills recently and her complexion was spotless, but last month Cox was spotted looking puffy-faced. When Courteney Cox hit the premiere for 'Hand of God,' on Aug. 19 in LA she looked almost unrecognizable.  Courteney Cox looks years younger than she is. Cox, who just made her directorial debut, credits spa treatments and avoiding the sun. The Friends actress's face looked frozen at the Amazon premiere for drama series ""Hand Of God,"" reported Daily Mail. Courteney Cox, 51, shocked everyone when she arrived with her fiance, Johnny McDaid, 39, to the Ace Hotel for the Red Carpet premiere.  The 51-year-old actress denied getting plastic surgery, though she did admit to getting Botox.  ""It's no secret I've had some Botox in the past, but I won't go under the knife,"" Cox told Closer magazine. ""Johnny [Mcadaid, Courteney's boyfriend] isn't into that whole Hollywood look anyway, so I don't feel pressure to keep looking like a 20-year-old for him.""  It is reported that the star will marry Johnny Mcadaid this summer.  According to the National Enquirer, Jennifer Aniston things Botox looks terrible on everyone. This would include Cox and last year, the Friends co-star and Aniston's BFF took it personally.  ""I am grateful to learn from their mistakes, because I am not injecting s**t into my face. No honestly, I see them and my heart breaks. I think, 'Oh god if you only know how much older you look.' They are trying to stop the clock and all you can see is an insecure person who won't let themselves just age,"" Jennifer Aniston said In an interview with Yahoo Beauty last year.  ""I see them and my heart breaks. I think, 'Oh god if you only know how much older you look.' They are trying to stop the clock and all you can see is an insecure person who won't let themselves just age. I also have a fiancé; who will put a gun to my head if I touch my face in any way.""  Cox thinks Aniston's comments were a backhanded slap. When Cox confronted Aniston, Jennifer told Courteney to stop trying so hard to impress her much younger boyfriend with drastic plastic.  Back in 2013, Cox didn't rule out plastic surgery.  ""You know what, I'm game for anything. I'm very open to trying to prolong the inevitable. I'm a big laser believer - I really think they are the wave of the future. I just did Ulthera, which is supposed to produce collagen, and I'm about to do Fraxel, which will get rid of all these brown spots off my arms, chest and face,"" the mother of 11-year old Coco said at the time.  ''It feels different. I think it's hard, the fact that there's a certain age that we can't have kids anymore. My doctor told me today that he just delivered a baby and the woman was 48. It's like, that's awesome, but it's rare. It's a miracle, you know?""  ""From what I can tell reviewing her pics Courteney has had Botox to hold up her brow and prevent descent with aging,"" Dr. Raffi Hovsepian, M.D., a triple Board Certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills told HollywoodLife.com.  ""And volumizing of the Malar [under your eyes] and cheek area with either fillers or fat. Beyond that not much is done.""  ""It's been a very long time since Courteney looked like Courteney,"" Lyle M. Back, MD, FACS, Philadelphia area Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, told Hollywood Life.  ""She has always denied that she's had any cosmetic surgery, and I believe her - there are no signs of that. But in Hollywood, cosmetic procedures, both surgical and non-surgical, are often taken into the too much and too far zone. ... But it seems she may have had more than a couple of facial laser treatments to smooth the skin, as her too shiny face would suggest."""

1,"An article which appeared today in the German magazine, PI-News, reports that during a six-month break from his job with Germanwings, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, the man now accused of hijacking and crashing the 320 Airbus into the French Alps, killing all 150 aboard, converted to Islam.  An English translation of Michael Mannheimer’s article follows:  All evidence indicates that the copilot of Airbus machine in his six-months break during his training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and subsequently either by the order of “radical”, ie. devout Muslims , or received the order from the book of terror, the Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of the investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that he – as Mohammed Atta, in the attack against New York – received his instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque. Converts are the most important weapon of Islam. Because their resume do not suggests that they often are particularly violent Muslims. Thus Germany now has its own 9/11, but in a reduced form. And so it is clear that Islam is a terrorist organization that are in accordance with §129a of the Criminal Code to prohibit it and to investigate its followers. But nothing will happen. One can bet that the apologists (media, politics, “Islamic Scholars”) will agree to assign this an act of a “mentally unstable” man, and you can bet that now, once again the mantra of how supposedly peaceful Islam is will continue. And worse still, the attacks by the left against those who have always warned against Islam, will be angrier and merciless.  Of course, the pilot could be heard pounding on the cockpit door, which Lubitz had apparently locked from the inside.  Police have removed what they call a “significant piece of evidence” from Lubitz’s home in Montabaur, Germany, but will not say what is was.  Total Views: 1317 ,"
1,"ENLARGE Forces arrive at the scene of a hostage taking at an industrial zone in Dammartin-en-Goële, northeast of Paris, by men believed to be the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack, on Friday. Christian Hartmann/Reuters  PARIS—At least one hostage was seized Friday by gunmen believed to be behind the attack on French weekly Charlie Hebdo after shots were fired northeast of Paris, police officers said.  The suspects have stolen a small red Peugeot car, said one of the police officers. The hostage was taken in an office building, said another officer. “It’s very likely the work of the shooters” suspected of killing 12 people at the magazine on Wednesday, the second officer added.  “An operation is currently under way near Dammartin-en-Goële that is mobilizing all the forces in the area,” said French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking in a short televised address.  The Raid, a police special forces unit, and the GIGN, an elite police force that reports to the Defense Ministry, are on their way, he added.  Mr. Cazeneuve said that all security forces are mobilized to stop the terrorists “as quickly as possible.”  French television showed police vehicles streaming towards the town.  “The effectiveness of the measures put in place yesterday allow us to act, and act quickly,” Mr. Cazeneuve said.  The development came as the manhunt entered a third day.  Tens of thousands of soldiers and police mobilized across France on Thursday to find the brothers after President François Hollande raised the terror alert in an area north of Paris where the search was concentrated. Two men matching the description of the suspects were spotted at a gas station.  U.S. and French intelligence believe that one of the two gunmen—both of whom have been on watch lists of possible terrorists for years—had received weapons training from an al Qaeda offshoot in Yemen in 2011, U.S. officials said. They added that they haven’t found any intelligence that the group, known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, directed, ordered or monitored Wednesday’s attack.  The two suspects were identified as 34-year-old Said Kouachi and his brother, Chérif Kouachi, 32, both French citizens.  Mr. Cazeneuve invited top U.S. and European law-enforcement and counterterrorism officials to Paris this weekend to discuss terror threats, amid concerns that the gunmen appeared to have some military acumen.  Nine people, including relatives of the two suspects, were detained for questioning by police in relation to the investigation, Mr. Cazeneuve told a news conference in Paris on Thursday, without elaborating.  ENLARGE A helicopter hovers above the scene of a hostage taking at an industrial zone in Dammartin-en-Goële, northeast of Paris, by men believed to be the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack, on Friday. Reuters  Mr. Cazeneuve said both the suspects were known to French security and were under surveillance, but no incriminating evidence had been gathered on them.  The minister said the elder brother had been formally identified from a photograph as one of the attackers. His national identity card was found in an abandoned Citroën that had been used as a getaway car.  While Said Kouachi had no police record, his brother had been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for being part of a terror group, prosecutors said.  Both have been in a U.S. database of suspected terrorists—and on the U.S. no-fly list—for years as well. For the younger brother, that was due to his conviction in France, while the other’s name had surfaced in other terrorism-related probes, according to U.S. officials.  A third suspect identified by police as Hamid Mourad, 18, turned himself in late Wednesday. His relationship to the others was unclear.  The masked gunmen’s attack decimated Charlie Hebdo’s newsroom, which has for years stirred outrage—and death threats—with its caricatures lampooning Islam, just one of its many targets of satire.

1,"FACT CHECK: Has Walmart recalled more than seven tons of parasite-ridden bananas?  Claim: Walmart has recalled more than seven tons of parasite-ridden bananas. FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2015]  Post on face book from Now 8 News claiming that 7 tons of bananas were infested with Shistosmiasis worms and are being recalled. The parasite is waterborne in various countries including Maylasia, where Walmart gets most its bananas. Alert says not to bring back to the store, but to wrap in plastic bag and throw away. Alert says do not put down the disposal or water supply could be contaminated. Shows video of disgusting worm on banana. Claims several people in the hospital from ingesting the infested fruit. That there is a mass panic. Parasite ingestion could cause symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, fatigue, and in some severe cases stroke-like conditions.  Origins: On 9 August 2015, the web site Now8News published an article titled “ALERT: Over 7 Tons of Bananas Recalled from Walmart Due to Parasitic Worms.”  The article claimed that several tons of bananas offered for sale by Walmart were contaminated with a parasitic worm, causing customers to fall ill with the disease schistosomiasi, and that purchasers of Walmart bananas had been instructed to “burn” the fruit:  Although they are recalling bananas purchased between the dates of July 30 — August 6, they are asking consumers NOT to return the bananas to the stores. They are asking, if at all possible, to burn the bananas. If you do not have access to this type of disposal, the World Health Organization is asking you to seal them tightly in a trash bag but DO NOT dispose of them down the kitchen sink. This could contaminate the water supply, as these parasites thrive off of water. Currently, 187 people have been hospitalized and 23 are in critical condition. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches, nausea, fatigue and stomach bloating. In severe cases, the parasites can affect the nervous system causing stroke-like conditions. If you feel that you have been exposed to the Schistosomiasis parasites you should take yourself to the hospital immediately.  However, the article was just more fake news from Now8News (designed to look like a local television news web site), a new entrant to the burgeoning fake news genre of sites and not a legitimate media outlet. In July 2015, Now8News “reported” that a man was arrested for having sex with a pig in a Walmart bathroom, and that aborted fetuses were used in making Chicken McNuggets.

1,"Washington (CNN) Since announcing his campaign in late June, Donald Trump has quickly leapt to the top of the Republican field, leading recent polls nationally, in Iowa and in New Hampshire. And now, for the first time in CNN/ORC polling, his gains among the Republican Party have boosted him enough to be competitive in the general election.  But Clinton still holds the cards overall in the race for the White House, leading four Republican contenders: She tops Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by 6 points each among registered voters, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by 9 points, and businesswoman Carly Fiorina by 10 points.  Photos: Who's running for president?

Hide Caption 6 of 6  Clinton maintains this edge in the general election race despite a growing perception that by using a personal email account and server while serving as secretary of state she did something wrong. About 56% say so in the new poll, up from 51% in March. About 4-in-10 (39%) now say she did not do anything wrong by using personal email. Among Democrats, the share saying she did not do anything wrong has dipped from 71% in March to 63% now, and just 37% of independents say she did not do wrong by using the personal email system.  And positive impressions of Clinton continue to fade. Among all adults, the new poll finds 44% hold a favorable view of her, 53% an unfavorable one, her most negative favorability rating since March 2001. A majority of women voters have a positive take on Clinton, 52% view her favorably, and her support among women appears to be the foundation for her general election advantages.  But the fading numbers haven't hurt her against some GOP contenders. Clinton has her biggest lead over Fiorina, topping her 53% to 43% among registered voters. She leads Bush by a nearly identical margin, 52% to 43%. And Clinton tops both Trump (51% to 45%) and Walker (52% to 46%) by 6 points each.  All of those leads are boosted by sizable gender gaps.  Against Bush, Clinton leads 59% to 37% among women, while Bush holds an advantage among men, 51% Bush to 44% Clinton. Against Fiorina, the only woman among the major candidates for the Republican Party's presidential nominations, women break 60% for Clinton to 39% for Fiorina, while men are about evenly divided, 48% for Fiorina, 46% for Clinton. The largest gender gap -- 34 points -- comes in a match-up between Clinton and Trump. Women favor Clinton by 23 points, 60% to 37%, while men break in Trump's favor by 11 points, 53% to 42%.  At the same time, Clinton's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president is narrowing, and the new poll suggests the best way for the former secretary of state to shift the momentum would be for Vice President Joe Biden to decide to sit this one out. Most Democrats, though, say they'd like to see Biden make a run for the White House.  Overall, 47% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they support Clinton for the party's nomination. That's down 9 points since July, and marks the first time her support has dipped below 50% in national CNN/ORC polling on the race.  And though support for Clinton's nomination bid has slipped, she is the candidate most trusted by Democrats on four top issues, and remains the candidate to beat in general election match-ups.  Should Biden decide not to make a run for the presidency, his supporters would largely flock to Clinton rather than Sanders, boosting her numbers. With Biden's backers re-allocated to their second choice, Clinton holds 56%, Sanders 33%, with support for O'Malley, Webb and Chafee unchanged.  Among those Democratic voters who are ""extremely enthusiastic"" about voting for president next year, it's already essentially a two-person race. Clinton is the choice of 50% of such voters, with Sanders jumping to 38% among that group, Biden at 6%, and O'Malley at 2%.  Still, most Democrats say they do want Biden to make a go of it: 53% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden should run, 45% that he should stay out. Even among those who currently support Clinton, 50% say they think Biden should run.  Democratic voters aren't necessarily convinced a Biden presidency would be better than a Clinton one, though: 35% say Biden would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 27% a better one and 38% say there wouldn't be any difference between the two. Those who think Biden should run are more apt to say he'd do a better job than a worse one (41% better vs. 18% worse) but a sizable 41% say there ultimately wouldn't be any difference between the two.  Fewer see Sanders as equivalent to Clinton, more say he'd do a worse job. Overall, 37% of Democratic voters think Sanders would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 31% that he'd do a better job, and 29% that there would be no difference between the two. That shifts among the party's liberal voters, 41% of whom think Sanders would do a better job than Clinton, 34% think he would do worse than Clinton and 22% that there would be no difference.  Sanders has boosted his favorability rating in the last month, 35% of adults and 58% of Democratic voters have a positive impression of the senator, that's up from 23% among adults and 36% among Democratic voters since July.  When Democratic voters are asked which candidate they trust to handle the economy, race relations, foreign policy and the income gap between rich and poor Americans, Clinton tops the list each time. Her biggest advantage comes on foreign policy, where 61% of registered Democrats say they trust Clinton over the rest of the field. Biden follows at 22%, and just 9% say Sanders is their top choice here. On the economy, 45% say Clinton would best handle it, 26% choose Sanders and 21% Biden.

Once the postergirl for mall-rat rebels everywhere, Avril was a verifiable superstar in the early-aughts with seminal sing-a-longs Ã la ""Sk8r Boi"" and ""Complicated"" -- however her star has fallen in recent years after a slew of terrible, kawaii-appropriation stunts, a foray into the world of sugar-rush EDM and, uh, Chad Kroger.      Well, according to a Noisey deep dive , some Avril fans in Brazil (specifically the ""Avril Is Dead"" Blogspot ) have apparently come up with an explanation, because the real Avril Lavigne died immediately after the release of her debut album and was replaced by a doppelganger named Melissa Vandella.      As the conspiracy goes, after the immense success of 2002's pop-punk gem Let Go, Avril fell into a deep depression (spurred by the death of her grandfather and the pressure of fame), and was found dead at home -- with everyone in the know keeping hush-hush about the situation. And the proof? Well the absence and appearance of various moles and blemishes, duh.      Not convinced?

The rules, which were introduced this week, have already caused concern among prominent politicians.  “I think the president needs to fire the director immediately. I think Congress needs to pass a law to stop them from changing the oath,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican presidential candidate, told Breitbart News on Wednesday. “Let’s be honest here, immigration without assimilation is invasion. We’ve always said the people coming here have to want to be Americans, otherwise why are they coming here in the first place?”  Likewise, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in a statement on his official website, said the new rules would undermine the citizenship process.  The Obama Administration’s announced changes to the Oath of Allegiance undermines what it means to be a U.S. citizen. http://t.co/kcKeyy3DOC — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) July 22, 2015  Under the clarified guidelines that took effect Tuesday, certain immigrant candidates for citizenship will not be required to declare they will “bear arms on behalf of the United States” and “perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States,” depending on the person's personal beliefs.  Here are guidelines for possible exemption from military service:  -- May be eligible for modifications based on religious training and belief, or conscientious objection arising from a deeply held moral or ethical code.  -- Is not required to belong to a specific church or religion, follow a particular theology or belief, or to have had religious training in order to qualify.  -- May submit, but is not required to provide, an attestation from a religious or other type of organization, as well as other evidence to establish eligibility."
1,"Last night, The History Channel aired a two-hour special entitled Breaking History: Bigfoot Captured, a title presumably chosen because it directly refers to the mission of said program in breaking any conceivable perception that a network like History Channel might possibly air programs about, oh I don’t know, history.  Let’s say, for a second, in a purely hypothetical scenario, that I was made the supreme overseer of Hell, the realm of eternal punishment and suffering. In Jim’s new and revised Hell dimension, there would be a level devoted entirely to television producers who conceived and aired content in the style of Bigfoot Captured. There, surrounded by the wailing voices of 10,000 History Channel, Animal Planet and Discovery Channel executives, you would find the crews behind Mermaids: The Body Found, Megalodon: The New Evidence and others, sharing a cozy abode in the lake of fire. That’s my dream scenario.  Of course, in the real world, I suppose I would settle for everyone involved to simply be fired. And possibly put into a pillory and pelted with rotten vegetables, time permitting.  These shows, examples of so-called “docu-tainment” that have become commonplace (and huge ratings successes) on networks that have educational aims in their mission statements, are indicative of everything that is wrong in 21st century media. The fact that you have networks such as History Channel, Discovery and Animal Planet willfully and consciously planting falsehoods into the minds of their audience is absolutely shameful. There’s no other word for it. The people involved should be ashamed of themselves, because they are causing very real, literal harm. They’re actively performing the polemic opposite of their network’s stated function. I see no difference between this and learning that a grade school teacher is teaching your kid that we live in a Geocentric universe.  Your response to this outrage is probably to say “Oh come on, Jim, it’s entertainment. People know the sasquatch documentary they’re watching on History Channel is just entertainment. What’s the harm?”  The problem is that no, not everyone knows it’s entertainment. And if you’re intelligent enough to know that, then you should also realize that it’s the impressionable people watching who most need a source they can actually trust in order to provide real information. These people don’t need entertainment. They need a network that’s actually serving their best interest—and for the record, their best interest is “Not having pseudoscientific beliefs that they’ll pass on to anyone in earshot.”  Still don’t believe that anyone takes a program like Bigfoot Captured seriously?

Bigfoot is REAL. A species of gigantopithecus. — Chad (@ChadJones_) November 10, 2015  Those are all real tweets from real human beings that rolled in during the last half hour as I was sitting down to start writing this thing. Whether or not you want to admit it, or whether History Channel wants to admit it, these sentiments are indicative of at least a fair chunk of their audience. They have a responsibility to not mislead these human beings. It is their JOB to not allow people to believe this bullshit.  This is the responsibility that History Channel claims it's upholding when a two-hour long program is preceded by a disclaimer on screen for a few seconds saying that the program features “some dramatization.” At least, that's what I'm told appeared, because I started watching 60 seconds after the program began. For me, and anyone else who joined at any other point during that ludicrous 120 minute runtime, there was zero other indication that you were seeing anything other than an (admittedly shitty) documentary. Not until the end credits, with its clear listing of actors in the “scripted story” segments, do they come close to admitting what you've been watching that whole time. Good thing that American audiences always closely monitor TV credits, right?  Bigfoot Captured takes the form of a fake, feature-length documentary about a researcher traveling the globe in hopes of finding this cryptozoological specimen. This main character, as if this needs to be said, is a fictional person played by an actor. The result: Scenes of actors playing researchers, interviewing other actors playing witnesses. It's essentially a Russian nesting doll of bullshit. None of this is new, and has been the common practice in all the other fictional documentaries such as Mermaids: The Body Found, where you can literally look up the actors' names on IMDB.  Where Bigfoot Captured diverges, though, is in the rather insidious use of actual people alongside the fake characters. Idaho State University professor Jeffrey Meldrum, for instance, is extensively interviewed and featured; a real university professor and expert in human locomotion who has also studied Sasquatch reports. I found myself wondering: Can this man possibly have known what kind of TV program Bigfoot Captured was actually going to be? Did they lie to him, making him think they were conducting an actual documentary about bigfoot sightings? Or did they simply pay this guy, a college professor, enough to participate in a fake documentary knowing full well that it was going to end with five minutes of a CGI Sasquatch in a cage? Because if it's the latter, then that is a massive betrayal of a professor's charge to educate. If Dr. Jeffrey Meldrum knew what kind of program Bigfoot Captured was, then he should be summarily fired from his teaching position for failing an educator's version of the Hippocratic Oath. This is a man who has spoken out against Bigfoot hoaxers in the past, and yet here he now is participating happily in a fake documentary, purposely spreading misinformation. I wonder if I could get him on the phone to explain himself if I called Idaho State University often enough.  UPDATE: Dr. Meldrum has posted to Facebook essentially denouncing the production. It seems clear he had no idea what he was getting into. Hilarious.  This style of BS programming has now been refined into a science of its own. The narrative elements are careful in going out of their way to not “tell you what to believe,” or at least not directly. Instead, they present you with mounds of fake evidence and rely on the impressionable viewer to “come to their own conclusion.” Ignorant, close-minded skeptic characters are used as straw men to shoot down any potential arguments before they're raised. It all taps into the same desire that fuels conspiracy theorists in general—the desire to be a possessor of secret knowledge, to feel intelligent. The History Channel execs understand that the more ignorant portions of their audience desperately want to feel like they belong to a fraternity of people with knowledge that “they” (whoever the hell 'they' are in this scenario) DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. Perhaps they already believe these sorts of things—in that case, Bigfoot Captured simply triggers their confirmation bias.  Consider this Möbius strip of hypocrisy. In order to be on History Channel in the first place, the program has to make some sort of claim toward veracity—hence, the fake documentary format. Simultaneously, in order to not be called charlatans, the official position of History Channel has to be “people are just watching to be entertained, no one is taking this seriously.” SIMULTANEOUSLY, the show has to be believable enough to still fool people, because if it didn't, no one would be watching. Just writing that makes my brain want to gnaw its way out of my skull, seeking sweet freedom.  It all culminates in sequences that are, thankfully, so unabashedly ridiculous and SyFy Original Movie-esque that they hopefully would have dissuaded at least some of the potentially duped viewers from believing what they're seeing. I'd like to believe that the sequences of researchers being chased through the woods, pelted with boulders and inserted into what almost feels like a Sasquatch snuff film would be enough to make this clear, but then I just scroll up and re-read those earlier tweets.  Now, the fact that the special also pissed off some Sasquatch true believers, I don't even know how to feel about that. Welcome … ummm, allies? I think?  Never pull some shit like this again, very bad move. You just alienated thousands of believers. Good job! #BigfootCaptured — cory (@rundiggity) November 10, 2015  #bigfootcaptured @history The really sad part is this show will hurt and discredit the legitimate Bigfoot research! — Ty Curtis (@_TYSTA_) TYSTA/status/663953216887914496"">November 10, 2015  In the end, the captured Sasquatch of course escapes, although it unfolds in a sequence where it feels like the FX budget had been completely tapped out, so last-minute scenes were added in the 30 minutes before all the video equipment was repossessed. I shit you not, the phrase “I don’t think you locked the cage!” is actually uttered. As in, the Bigfoot escapes because the scientists who just tracked him for 10 days didn’t remember to lock his cage before they went to sleep. Unfortunately, it ends before we get to see them put up flyers on the nearby redwoods reading “Lost: One Sasquatch. Answers to ‘Urrrrrrggghaaaa’”.  Is this just the new normal, the standard we should be expecting from a network running commercials during that same programming block for Nostradamus prophecies and a new “Hitler in Argentina” series? At least ABC Family had the guts to admit their own “channel drift” phenomenon by announcing plans to change the name to “ABC Freeform.”  Congratulations, History Channel. You’ve truly earned the title of “that network with less dignity than ABC Family.” Be proud.

After writing for several minutes, the convict called the prison guard and asked that this letter be handed over to his biological mother.  The letter said …  Mother, if there were more justice in this world, we would be both executed and not just me. You’re as guilty as I am for the life I led.

He just wanted to correct me because I stole the final result of the competition and for that I had been expelled.  Mom, I was just a child, shortly after I became a troubled teenager and now I’m a pretty malformed man.  Mom, I was just a child in need of correction, and not an approval. But I forgive you!  I just want this letter to reach the greatest number of parents in the world, so they can know what makes all people, good or bad … is education.

1,"The co-pilot responsible for the Germanwings plane crash was today named as Andreas Guenter Lubitz.  The 28-year-old was from Montabaur, a town in the district seat of the Westerwaldkreis in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, according to a local flight club.  Acquaintances said he was in his late 20s and showed no signs of depression when they saw him last autumn.  His Facebook page lists his interests, including German electronica band Schiller, French superstar DJ David Guetta, his local Burger King, 10-pin bowling, aviation humour and a technical website about the A320 model of aircraft he flew into a mountainside.  Today, at the house believed to be his parents', the curtains were drawn and four police cars were parked outside.  ""He was happy he had the job with Germanwings and he was doing well,"" said a member of a glider club, Peter Ruecker, who watched him learn to fly.  ""He gave off a good feeling.""  Ruecker said Lubitz had a girlfriend but did not have many more details about his life.  Lubitz had obtained his glider pilot's license as a teenager and was accepted as a Lufthansa pilot trainee after finishing a tough German college preparatory school, Mr Ruecker said.  He described Lubitz as a ""rather quiet"" but friendly young man.  Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot ""never said a word"" in the 10 minutes before the crash, which killed 150 people.  He said he never answered a question or opened the door before the plane hit the ground and the plane's descent was ""voluntary"".  (Image: Reuters)  The Federal Aviation Administration praised Lubitz's skills and included him in the prestigious FAA Airmen Certification Database.  The database contains the names certified pilots who have ""met or exceeded the high educational, licensing and medical standards established by the FAA"".  Aviation Business Gazette announced the award in September 2013, writing: ""Pilot certification standards have evolved over time in an attempt to reduce pilot errors that lead to fatal crashes.  ""FAA pilot certification can be the difference between a safe flight and one that ends in tragedy.  The highest level of certification is the Airline Transport Pilot Certificate, which is required to fly a commercial airliner.  To obtain it, pilots must possess a commercial pilot license, have more than 1500 hours of experience in aircraft and be at least 21. They are also required to pass a physical examination.  Lubitz's medical was done in 2010 and was due to run out in June 2015. He had undertaken 630 hours of flight time in an A320, according to Germany's Bild.  Mr Brice said earlier that co-pilot Lubitz directed the plane into the ground but the passengers only realised what was happening ""in the last moments"".  ""He took this action, for reasons we still don't know why,"" he said.  ""We can only deduce he destroyed the plane. He voluntarily allowed the plane to lose altitude.  ""I think the victims only realised at the last moment because on the recording you only hear the screams on the last moments."""

False  Example: [Collected via e-mail, October 2015]  Powerball and mega million to give away 1 million dollars online. Is this true?  Origins: In mid-October 2015, social media postings began touting that the Mega Millions and Powerball lottery games were giving away $1 million to people who shared a Facebook message:  These posts were nothing more than variants of the long-running sweepstakes scam, which has previously targeted customers of such entities as Walmart, Home Depot, and Publix. Each of these scams exhibits slight variations, but they all seek to reach a larger audience by requiring people to share the scam with their friends on Facebook. While these charlatans promise that sharing, liking, or commenting on a given Facebook post will make a person a millionaire, what Facebook users who fall for the come-ons are really doing is spreading a malicious scam to more and more potential victims:  Don’t believe what you see. It’s easy to steal the colors, logos and header of an established organization.

1,"LGBT No, 100,000 People Did Not Gather In Peru To Support Kim Davis. Here’s Proof. CREDIT: Twitter/@jmattbarber  Embattled Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis was no doubt the guest of honor at this year’s Values Voter Summit, with the hosting Family Research Council awarding her a “Cost of Discipleship Award.” Mat Staver, chairman of the Liberty Counsel, which legally represents her, praised her courage and claimed that 100,000 people had attended a prayer rally to support her in Peru.  Staver posted the following image at the summit to support his claim:  CREDIT: Family Research Council VVS Live Stream/Screenshot  The image seems to have first been tweeted the day before the summit by Matt Barber, also formerly of the Liberty Counsel, who claimed, “Christians in Peru had a prayer rally for #KimDavis & American Christians. over 100K showed up. Amazing!” Staver posted the image a second time on Sunday, claiming that Peruvian Congressman Julio Rosas was responsible for organizing it.  There is not a single news story about a prayer rally taking place in Peru for Kim Davis. There is not a single post on Rosas’ Twitter or Facebook about such a rally, though he did send one tweet of support for Staver’s defense of Davis. And the image is almost certainly from a prayer rally known as “Jesús Te Ama Y Te Cambia” (“Jesus Loves You And Changes You”), which did take place in Peru — over five days in May, 2014.  Internet sleuths, including Twitter user @DCHomos, quickly identified the stadium as the Estadio Universidad Nacional Mayor San Marcos at the National University of San Marcos. Then, a number of videos seemed to quickly confirm that the image shared by Staver and Barber was from the 2014 convention organized by the pentecostal Movimiento Misionero Mundial (Worldwide Missionary Movement).  This video, taken from one of the evening events of the convention, seems to clearly identify the pink banner visible in the photo as one bearing the name of the event:  CREDIT: YouTube/Bethel Televisión Screenshot  Another video, shot by a convention attendee, clearly shows many identifiable features from the photo, including the array of orange porta potties, the dark grey media tent in the center aisle, the yellow security vests and red usher vests, the sound system scaffolding around the outside track, the distinct white chairs, and at 1:27, the exact same pink banner propped up in the front row:  It may well be true, as Barber claimed in his tweets, that attendees of Jesús Te Ama Y Te Cambia prayed for American Christians writ large, but at that point in time, nobody knew who Kim Davis was. The event almost certainly didn’t happen over the past few months, and did not happen specifically to support Davis."
1,"Alia Beard Rau  The Republic | azcentral.com  For the second time in two days, a judge has struck a blow to an Arizona abortion law.  On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Steven Logan issued a preliminary injunction officially halting the law that requires doctors to tell patients a medication abortion can be reversed.  A trial scheduled for next week on the new law, approved this year by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey, was canceled. According to court records, the state asked the court to postpone the trial because they needed more time to prepare and seek experts qualified to testify about the reversal protocol. The underlying case continues to work its way through the courts.  Opponents of the law allege it is based on ""junk science.""  “This junk science law would force doctors to lie to their patients and put women’s health at risk,"" said Bryan Howard, President of Planned Parenthood Arizona, in a statement. ""In no other area of medicine would this stand. It’s clear that politicians will stop at nothing to insert government and bad medicine into every exam room in Arizona — and we will fight back on behalf of our patients every step of the way.”  The law was the first of its kind in the nation, although Arkansas lawmakers quickly passed a similar law.  Court overturns Arizona's abortion-medication law  Supporters argue viable pregnancies, including at least one in Arizona, are living proof that such abortions can be halted mid-protocol.    About one-third of all abortions in Arizona are done using medication instead of surgical procedures, according to a new state report. Medication abortions are done very early in a pregnancy. They typically involve an initial pill, mifepristone, which interferes with the hormone progesterone, and a second pill, misoprostol, which expels the fetus. There were 12,900 reported abortions in Arizona last year.  In some instances, women who have taken the first pill and changed their minds were given a high dose of progesterone and continued with their pregnancy. Supporters of the reversal protocol claim a 60 percent success rate.  The legal complaint alleges the law violates doctors' First Amendment rights because it forces them to convey ""a state-mandated message that is not medically or scientifically supported."" It alleges the law violates patients' Fourteenth Amendment rights because they are getting ""false, misleading and/or irrelevant information.""  Legal battles over state laws regulating abortion in Arizona have become an annual drill over the past decade, typically pitting the Christian-conservative advocacy group Center for Arizona Policy and the state against the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. The results have been mixed.  Friday's decision follows a Thursday ruling by a Maricopa County Superior Court judge, who declared unconstitutional a 2012 law regulating how medication that induces abortions could be prescribed."
1,"Casey Anthony Found Dead At Age 29  Casey Anthony Found Dead At Age 29 – Unconfirmed reports coming out of Warren, Ohio state that the body of Casey Anthony was found in a rest stop near I-71, bludgeoned to death. At 6:37 PM, a traveler noticed a body in the back of a pickup truck abandoned in a grassy field about 20 yards from the parking area as he was walking his dog.  The man said as he approached the vehicle, there was a horrible stench in the air. He was shocked to find a young female, in her late 20’s to early 30’s, partially dismembered. The man immediately called 911. Police arrived and quickly closed off a section of I-71 and the nearby rest stop as they further investigated the scene. The man who stumbled across the body, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that the woman in the back of the truck had a severed arm, multiple stab wounds to the stomach, and her skull was partially caved in at the top. Her mouth was duct taped shut, with a heart-shaped sticker adhered to the outside of the duct tape. Reports say her face was covered in maggots, and eyewitnesses say it was “something they will never forget.”  Casey Anthony Found Dead At Age 29  Police are staying tightlipped with the media about the specifics at the scene. However, eyewitnesses at the scene, including the man that stumbled across the body, say not only does she look like Casey Anthony, but police were mentioning her name. Police say they will not release any specific information until the family of the deceased woman is notified. We will keep you updated with any additional information as it comes along and details are confirmed."
1,"White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted Aug. 28 that the president’s plan to aggressively regulate people’s ability to defend themselves would not have stopped the live-TV shooting of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward.  The planned background checks “would not have applied in this particular case,” he acknowledged.  The gunman, Vester Lee Flanagan, passed a background check when he purchased the gun he used to kill his two former co-workers. The Washington Times reports that he bought two guns from a “Virginia [gun] dealer.”  Flanagan claimed the two victims deserved to be shot for supposed racism, and he also slammed other media colleagues for supposed dislike of gays. However, his claims likely were politically fashionable rationales for a suicidal act of non-political viciousness.  Despite his admission that the president’s plan would not have stopped Flanagan, Earnest still pushed President Barack Obama’s plan to regulate self-defense. “The White House has never suggested that one piece of gun legislation would prevent all gun violence in the U.S.,” he said.  Andy Parker–father of slain reporter Alison Parker–has pledged to start pushing for “gun violence restraining orders” in Virginia, although he admits they “would’t have saved” his daughter from Vester Lee Flanagan.

1,"Editor's note: This story was originally published on Nov. 4, 2014, before Prince was scheduled to perform at Toronto's Massey Hall. On April 21, 2016, police responded to an emergency medical call at the 57-year-old singer-songwriter's home studio in Minnesota. A publicist later confirmed that Prince had died.  From what he's said in the past, Prince is a guy who has a thing for Toronto.  Manuela Testolini and singer Prince are seen attending the 77th Academy Awards in Los Angeles in February 2005. The couple filed for divorce the following year. (Kevork Djansezian/Associated Press)  ""I love Toronto,"" he told The Canadian Press a decade ago, in an interview that was printed in the Toronto Star.  Praising the city as ""cosmopolitan,"" he talked about the variety of people that live within Toronto and its nightlife — including its music scene and its restaurants.  ""It's a real melting pot in every sense of the word,"" he said of the city.  In return, the city has loved him back.  When Prince played a show at the old Warehouse back in 1997, long lines of fans waited to see him play, just as they are doing today at Massey Hall.  ""Very short, but very, very sexy, we love him,"" said one fan, who described the singer to CBC News while she waited outside ahead of the show, which was a warm-up for a longer tour.  Fans lined up early outside Toronto's Massey Hall for a shot at tickets to a rumoured ""surprise"" show by Prince. (CBC)  In the early- and mid-2000s, he was married to a Torontonian, Manuela Testolini. It was a pairing that led to Prince spending time in the city.  It was during this period that Prince recorded the album Musicology. Media reports from that time indicated the recording work was done in Toronto. But the jacket of the CD only lists recording work at Mississauga's Metalworks Studios, as well as additional work in Minnesota, his home state, and New York.  He and Testolini would later split, filing a petition for divorce in July of 2006, according to People magazine.  Over the years, Prince has reportedly been spotted at Raptors games, or even taking to a stage on occasion — including as a DJ.  A Toronto Star feature story from April 2004 described the sequence of events that would typically occur before Prince would drop in to a downtown club. ""Prince's security calls ahead, checks things out, then the singer takes a low-key spot, either alone or with his wife, and sips coffee, Amaretto on ice or Merlot through a straw,"" the paper reported.  Prince was spotted attending a Raptors game back in January of 2002, a time period in which he was married to a woman from Toronto, Manuela Testolini, and reported to be spending some of his time in the city. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press)  If Prince indeed plays a rumoured ""surprise"" show in Toronto tonight, contrary to what Massey Hall security and Live Nation were saying late Tuesday afternoon, he should be joined on stage by another woman with connections to the city.  Donna Grantis plays guitar in 3rdEyeGirl, the band that has recently been playing with Prince.  A bio on her website describes how Grantis moved to Toronto after earning a jazz performance degree at McGill University.  Living in Toronto, Grantis became an ""in-demand studio musician,"" she went on tour and she fronted a band of her own.  She ended up joining 3rdEyeGirl after they came across her work on the Internet."
1,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.  During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.  The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.  In Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.  “The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”  As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.  Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.  At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.  And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.  George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”  As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.  Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.  Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”  George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.  Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.  “We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”  Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.  “There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”  POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from POLITICO and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.  “Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.  For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.  Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.  “What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.”  All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.  But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was “encouraged” by their first post-election meeting.  Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS’ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.  “He was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,” Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was “inappropriate.”  As Barack Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about President Donald Trump. | AP Photo  Historically speaking, Trump’s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors’ had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. “That one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,” she said  And Trump hasn’t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy!” as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush “not nice” during the campaign, said the Bush administration “lied” about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton “the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.”  George H.W. Bush and Carter weren’t excluded from Trump’s slights. “Enough is Enough- No More Bushses!” Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.  Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.  And Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and — while revealing that he voted for Sanders — Carter said the ""downturn"" of human rights ""preceded 2016.""  “President Carter, I think he hopes that he won’t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,” Hochman said. “Actually, I’m sure he would.”  Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He’s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.  “They may have personal opinions, but they’re not going to express them,” Skinner said. “Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they’ve been both very cautious about what they say.”  McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. “I wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,” he said.  Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today’s events in Washington.  “I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,” he said."
