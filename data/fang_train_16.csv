0,"This afternoon, an apparent ISIS supporter tweeted the above image along with the text “O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS,” and some in the right-wing media reported that the tweet constituted an advance warning about the deadly attack. The only problem: It was posted long after the shooting began.  Here’s a screencap via Rob Bettis:  Reporting of ISIS tweet is inaccurate. Tweet is time stamped 10:34 *PT* (1:34 ET). 2 hrs after the event.#CHAshooti… pic.twitter.com/KDE8o0cMj9 July 16, 2015  Twitter user @K_H_O7777777777—whose account was suspended this afternoon—published the tweet at 1:34 p.m. Eastern Time, roughly three hours after Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing at a military recruiting center this morning, killing four Marines. Nonetheless, the hysterically anti-Islam blogger Pamela Geller published a post about the hours-late “warning,” and as Mediaite notes, Fox News’ Catherine Herridge said that @K_H_O7777777777 “seemed to have foreknowledge about the shooting” on-air.  [There was a video here]  Geller and Herridge may want to take a closer look at Twitter’s time-zone function. A screencap of the tweet that’s making the rounds on right-wing Twitter does show a 10:34 a.m. timestamp, but that’s only because it was taken somewhere in the Pacific Time Zone, and Twitter displays time stamps in local time."

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist serving with Hamilton’s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment, was shot dead while guarding the National War Memorial. The gunman, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was later shot dead inside the main Parliament building.  You can watch the speeches and read the text, based in part on prepared remarks, of each of their addresses below.  Stephen Harper  PM speaks on Ottawa shooting News 6:56 Raw video from Stephen Harper 6:56  ""My fellow Canadians: for the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil.  Today our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Cpl. Cirillo was killed today — murdered in cold blood — as he provided a ceremonial honour guard at Canada's National War Memorial, that sacred place that pays tribute to those who gave their lives so that we can live in a free, democratic and safe society.  Likewise, our thoughts and prayers remain also with the family and friends of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired terrorist.  Tonight, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these despicable attacks.  Fellow Canadians, we've also been reminded today of the compassionate and courageous nature of so many Canadians -- like those private citizens and first responders who came to provide aid to Cpl. Cirillo as he fought for his life.  And, of course, the members of our security forces — in the RCMP, the City of Ottawa police and in Parliament — who came quickly and at great risk to themselves to assist those of us who were close to the attack.  Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.  We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values. on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.  But let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.  While today has been without question a difficult day, I have every confidence that Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our country through many challenges.  Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us. For now, Laureen and Ben and Rachel and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched by today's attack. May God bless them and keep our land glorious and free.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair  Opposition speaks about Ottawa shooting News 5:38 Raw video from Tom Mulcair 5:38  [The first four and a half lines of the text below are from prepared remarks that were not caught on video in the CBC broadcast above.]  ""Good evening my fellow Canadians. Today the peace of our nation's capital was shattered by an act of hatred and brutality -- cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, at the heart of who we are.  But I'm here tonight in solidarity, side-by-side with my colleagues, with our Prime Minister and with all Canadians.  This attack struck with sudden and deadly violence. It was carried out on the very ground where we come together to exchange ideas with the knowledge that whatever our differences, we will always resolve them peacefully.  It was intended to make us more fearful of our neighbours and less confident in ourselves. But it has failed. Today's events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.  And to the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces, I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and, indeed, your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.  Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone here in our nation's capital are with the family and loved ones of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Forces member from Hamilton, Ont., who lost his life this morning — the second in just a few days.  Cpl. Cirillo was literally standing on guard at a monument dedicated to the sacrifice of others who came before him. To his family and friends, I tell you that 35 million Canadians at home and abroad from coast to coast to coast and around the world stand with you tonight, and we will not forget.  In this moment, Canadians are unified in grief and stricken with disbelief. Canada is shaken today, but we shall not waver. We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow, we will do the same.  These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate. They will not. We will stand up, we will stand together. We will persevere, and we will prevail.  Good evening.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau  Liberal leader speaks about Ottawa shooting News 10:18 Raw video from Justin Trudeau 10:18  ""My fellow Canadians: I’m speaking to you from a Parliament Hill just coming out of lockdown. I am deeply saddened by today’s horrific events here in Ottawa and unreservedly condemn these brutal and heartless acts of violence. This attack is unforgivable. Should any other perpetrators or co-conspirators exist, they must be caught and be punished to the full force of our laws.  I’ve extended an offer of full support to the government along with any assistance members of our party can provide at this time. My thoughts and prayers, along with those of my colleagues, go out to the family and friends of the victims of today’s horrific shooting, including Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, who was standing dutifully, guarding one of our nation’s most sacred monuments.  It was a cowardly act — an unarmed man was murdered in cold blood, at close range. Words cannot express this deep sadness we feel over his loss. To the brave women and men who rushed to the scene to confront the shooter and to help keep us safe, I say only, 'Thank you. Thank you for your selfless courage and your professionalism in this time of crisis.'  In the days that follow, there will be questions, anger and perhaps confusion. This is natural, but we cannot let this get the better of us. Losing ourselves to fear and speculation is the intention of those who commit these heinous acts. They mean to shake us. We will remain resolved. They want us to forget ourselves. Instead, we will remember. We will remember who we are.  We are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.  Our dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.  Criminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.  Today, some speak of the loss of innocence in Canada. This is inaccurate. Canada is not and has never been innocent to the threats we face. And we know, as we have always known, that we are not immune. What is true is that we have never let those threats shape us, and we have never bowed to those who mean to undermine our values and our way of life. We have remained Canadians, and this is how we will carry on.  We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack. And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith. Continued mutual co-operation and respect will help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.  We will walk forward together, not apart.  In the coming days, we will be inundated with pictures and videos showing what happened today. But there is one in particular we should all remember: the picture in our minds we have of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians. That is who we truly are, and it is who we shall continue to be.  Good night."""

During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.  ""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""  The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week’s events.  Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.  Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.  Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board.

However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.

Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.  A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.

The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.  The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.  Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman.

1,"Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom – News 8 Louisiana – Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua Johnson shoving sausages under her shirt. CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.  The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will “haunt his dreams forever.” The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said that when he entered “She didn’t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.”  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Shocked, and also frightened for his safety due to the fact that Johnson is a “big girl,” the 140 pound security guard said he ran out until police arrived. When they did, female officers entered the restroom with Johnson still “putting in work with the sausage.” All in all, it took 7 police officers to restrain Johnson and pry the victimized sausage out of the woman’s hands. She was arrested and taken into custody where she was charged with shoplifting, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. Walmart management said in no way do they tolerate this type of behavior. They have a strict policy against shoplifters and a sign on the bathroom door that clearly reads, “No merchandise allowed beyond this point.”"
1,"Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.  “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”  Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.  “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”  “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded."

1,"On 22 November 2015, the Facebook page New Yorkers posted a photograph purportedly showing a 41-lb rat caught in New York City:    41 pound rat recently caught in NYC… (via Chris Brannigan)  Although image was widely shared by various online outlets, no one provided any substantive information about the allegedly enormous rodent.  If the pictured rat were truly was “caught” in New York City, it would most likely have been a brown rat (also known as a Norway or Norwegian rat). The city is home to approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these rodents only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs. in weight.  As many commenters pointed out on in responding to the original Facebook post, the pictured animal doesn’t look like it was “caught” at all. The rat appears to be groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone’s pet. If that’s the case, this animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these rodents are a fair bit larger than the brown rat, they don’t typically grow any bigger than four pounds.  So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It’s likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (whose hands cannot be seen) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. This technique creates the illusion that what is likely just an average-sized rat appears to be much larger in the photograph.  For comparison’s sake, here’s a photograph of a 3-foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012:"
1,"Hundreds of Prince fans who lined up for hours outside Massey Hall had their hopes dashed Tuesday afternoon when promoter Live Nation confirmed on Twitter that there would be no concert that night after all.  Fans of the pop legend reported being turned away without tickets or wristbands — and no word on whether a surprise show would be scheduled for Wednesday.  “When we were told very abruptly after seven hours of waiting that ‘Prince would not be playing Massey Hall this evening’ and they were ‘taking the barricades down,’ it was quite shocking that there was no more information given,” said Rebecca Webster, a local music publicist who was near the front of the line on Tuesday.  “I don’t know who is at fault for that. When I left, there were a lot of people determined that there was a show that evening.”  Indeed, there were still some diehards lined up outside Massey Hall at 7:30 p.m. in the rain, a testament to the dedication of Prince’s fans.  In a Facebook post Tuesday night, promoter Live Nation apologized for “any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today.”  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal,” the post said. “There was no concert scheduled for today.”  A statement from 3rdeyegirl, Prince’s collaborating band, on Tuesday evening added: “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances . . .  “We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  But it was 3rdeyegirl that helped cause the commotion to begin with. Social media had picked up on the rumour early Tuesday morning after the band issued a cryptic tweet with Toronto spelled backwards: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING. . . ”  The tweet was quickly deleted around 8:30 a.m., but not before it spread like wildfire online.  Many posted on social media that tickets to the show would reportedly cost $10 and only the first 200 people in line would be let in. Others said there could be a pair of shows performed by Prince: one Tuesday night and another Wednesday.  Scott Morin, a 40-year-old jazz record label manager and lifelong Prince fan, said he was tipped off about the show when his Google Alerts awoke him Monday night to inform him of the 3rdeyegirl tweet.  He said he quickly mobilized a handful of friends, also Prince aficionados, and made it to the front of the Massey Hall lineup by 7:45 a.m.  “I figured there would be quite a lineup, but there were only a few people, so we lucked out,” he said while motioning to the hundreds and counting who had lined up behind him in the hours after.  Rebecca Webster had made it to Massey Hall at 8 a.m. to find herself fourth in line. She and her friends figured the rumours were plausible.  “The venue (Massey Hall) was available, the artist was nearby (New York) and the style of the announcement was very in keeping with how he likes to do things,” she said. “When we arrived there was full security detail and barriers set up. So we waited.”  And waited. And waited.  Webster says she often works with high-profile touring artists.  “I’ve managed guest lists for ‘surprise shows’ and most of the time they are kept fairly secret within the own artist camps as everyone has a hard time keeping a secret. What I’m saying is, it’s not an easy task to execute this kind of thing.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  Morin noted that this wouldn’t have been the first time Prince played a secret show.  In February last year, the performer played two consecutive surprise sets at the Electric Ballroom in London, England, and in British folksinger Lianne La Havas’s home.  Those shows were also sparked by a cryptic tweet from 3rdeyegirl.  With files from Ben Rayner  Read more about:"
1,"In the film Fight Club, groups of bored men led by Brad Pitt were depicted meeting up in secret to take part in bare knuckle brawls.  But a new web-based application promises to make such fights a reality by pitting violent strangers against each other.  Described as a Tinder for Fight Club, Rumblr allows users to arrange impromptu fights based on their location.  Rumblr has been described as 'Tinder for Fight Club' (left). It allows users to upload pictures of themselves along with a short profile so they can challenge other users and arrange to meet them for a fight (right)  It features a chat function to allow opponents to trash talk each other and an interactive map showing where fights are happening so others can go along to watch.  According to the app creator's website: 'Rumblr is an app for recreational fighters to find, meet, and fight other brawl enthusiasts nearby.  IS THE RUMBLR APP LEGAL? People using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries. Fighting in a public place is classed as disorderly conduct while arranging a fight to be attended by an audience could be considered an unlawful public assembly. In some areas seriously injuring someone in a fight can result in criminal charges even if the other person does not seek to press charges. In response to questions from MailOnline, the app's developers did warn that some users may risk prosecution if they used the app to arrange a fight. They said: 'Depending on where they fight, they may be. Regulations are different for every municipality and governing body.' They added, however, that those who criticised the app for encouraging violence were 'not open minded enough about the community we are providing value to'. Advertisement  'You don't need to fight to use Rumblr.  'With Rumblr Explore, anyone can browse and attend fights close by that other Rumblr users have arranged - all for free.'  The app was initially due to be released on Apple's App Store, but was rejected.  Apple has strict rules about apps that encourage violence or result in physical harm.  Instead the app will be released as a web app, and it has already attracted more than 300,000 people from around the world.  Speaking to MailOnline, Rumblr's developers Matt Henderson and Jack Kim, said: 'We've been recreational fighters our entire lives and were tired of the inefficiencies that exist when trying to find someone to fight.  'Rumblr alleviates the trouble fighters have when searching for suitable opponents.  'We were actually rejected by Apple's App Store so we have decided to transition Rumblr into a public, globally accessible web application.'  The web app is due to be launched at at 5pm EST (10pm GMT) today.  According to the developers, it works by allowing users to build a profile of themselves, including statistics about their weight and ability.  The 1999 film Fight Club, starring Brad Pitt (pictured), showed groups of bored men meeting up at underground gatherings to fight each other. Rumblr aims to overcome some of the difficulties faced by real life 'recreational fighters' when looking for someone to challenge  Rumblr includes a chat feature that allows users to challenge each other, lay down insults and make arrangements for a brawl (left). They can then broadcast these details so they appear on a map (right), allowing other users to see fights that are happening in their area  The app uses these to match fighters together who are nearby, but it also allows users to challenge each other based on their profile picture.  It encourages the fighters to lay down a challenge by 'telling your match what you don't like about their picture'.  When a challenge is accepted, the users can arrange a time and location before broadcasting the final details to attract a cloud.  .@Capn_CoolChris Rumblr will be available as a web application at https://t.co/tcYjoatwH7 Monday, Nov. 9th at 5:00 PM EST. 👊 — Rumblr (@rumblrapp) November 9, 2015  WHY BOYS WITH BEARDS ARE BAD They may have become to the go-to fashion accessory for men, but those with beards are more likely to be sexist, get into fights, cheat on their partners and steal, two new studies have revealed. The first of the two surveys, which involved 500 men aged between 18 and 72 from India and the US, studied men with nine facial hairstyles varying in length - from light stubble to a heavy beard. The group was asked to pick one that best matched their own facial hair and were then asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements about gender roles. The results revealed that 86 per cent of Indian men and 65 per cent of American men had facial hair, and those with beards of any length agreed more with hostile sexist statements than men without any facial hair.

1,"0  WASHINGTON, D.C. –  As it turns out, the Republicans may have been right all along, and President Obama is not the smartest person in the room after all. Since Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, all presidents have been given an IQ test at some point during their time as leader. Gerald Ford always held the record for lowest score, with a 111, which is considered just slightly above average. On the other end of the spectrum, George W. Bush scored a 132, which is considered ‘gifted.’ Two-Thirds of people who take the standardized IQ test score between 85-115.  The White House today spun President Obama’s 102 as a ‘solid average’ that is nothing to be ashamed of.  ”President Obama never claimed to be smarter than anybody else. As a matter as fact, he has always represented himself as a regular guy, ‘a man of the people,’ as it were,” said Josh Earnest, White House Press Secretary. “The key to being a good leader is to surround yourself with smart people, which President Obama has always done. As far as needing to be a genius to run the country, well – George W. Bush had the highest score ever, and look at how that mess turned out. So, the next time President Obama bypasses congress with an executive order, and you’re about to say something cruel, racist, or otherwise completely ignorant, remember that he’s just a regular guy getting things done for you. And hey! At least he’s in the triple digits!”  “Ha! I knew it! King Obama is just a few points away from being a dummy,” said Senator Ted Cruz. ”Einstein was a 160, and guess what America – I scored 145! I’m smarter than 99% of you! When I’m elected President, I’ll bring some common sense and smarts back into the White House. Let’s face it, don’t you want your President to be smarter than the guy asking you whether you want to ‘super size’ your fries at the drive through? ‘Vote for me America, I’m smart!’ Hell, I think I’ll make that a bumper sticker!”  0  Comments  comments"
