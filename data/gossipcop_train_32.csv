0,"Michael Bublé has officially retired from music following his son Noah's cancer battle.  The singer, 43, explained that the heartache he endured following son's cancer diagnosis at just three years old has changed his 'perception of life' and he is now done with fame.  Noah, now five, is currently in remission following his battle with liver cancer, but the ordeal has been life-changing for Bublé, who has since questioned his career in showbusiness.  Michael Bublé reveals he has decided to quit the music industry following his son's battle with cancer  Michael is married to Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, 31, and they share three children together; their eldest son Noah, son Elias, two, and daughter Vida, whom they welcomed two months ago.  Both he and Luisana put their careers on hold to be there for their son - they jetted to the US so Noah could undergo treatment for hepatoblastoma.  The singer recalled how he used to make the 'best of the situation' during his hospital visits with Noah and tried to make it fun for his little boy.  Noah (pictured) now five, is currently in remission but Bublé says the ordeal has been life changing  With a new album, titled Love, on the way, he explained that this is his time to step away from music, wanting to leave at the 'very top' after making the 'perfect record'.  Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his 'last interview' with Daily Mail's Weekend magazine...  'My whole being’s changed since my son got cancer': Michael Bublé says he was embarrassed to realise just how egotistical he’d become as he nursed his boy Noah back to health - but now he's got his mojo back  By Chrissy Iley for Weekend Magazine  Michael Bublé knows better than most that fate does not stand aside and wave the famous through.  The Canadian singer has won four Grammys and sold 75 million records, earning him some £35 million a year.  Bublé opened up about the turmoil he and his family went through after his son Noah (pictured together) was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago  He’s been married to stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato for seven years, and the couple live a life of luxury with their three children, sons Noah, five, and Elias, two, and daughter Vida Amber Betty, who’s just 11 weeks old.  Yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago, and the devastated couple immediately announced they were putting their careers on hold to care for their son.  Noah has now been declared cancer-free and today Michael is looking suave and slim when we meet in his London hotel suite. He has a new album out, Love – but it’s one that he admits now might never have been made.  He’s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it’s clear he’s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.  ‘You just want to die,’ he says. ‘I don’t even know how I was breathing.  'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn’t strong. My wife was... I’m sorry, I can’t make it to the end of the sentence... let’s just say we find out who we are with these things.  Michael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear  'Going through this with Noah, I didn’t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?  'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.’  He says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni’s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni’s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.  ‘I don’t know if that was a choice, but that’s who I became,’ he says. ‘For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.  The singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did  'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I’d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.  ‘It’s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it’s not my story to tell, it’s his.  'But my whole being’s changed. My perception of life. I don’t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I’ve never lost control of my emotions in public.’  Michael likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  As a teenager he’d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he’d emulate them. ‘In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,’ he says.  ‘I actually thought I’d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.  'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.  'Everyone recognises me and says, “How’s your son?” When you think you’re close to getting over it you’re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.  Michael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis  'The media helped me, they weren’t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, “We love you and we’re praying for you.”’  I was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. ‘I had no interest in my career and I’m grateful I could afford to take time out,’ he says.  ‘I spent a good deal of time with people who weren’t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business.  'I’d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I’d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.  'I’d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I’d been having fun. I’d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.’  He grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. ‘I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.  I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have  'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.  'And I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have.  ‘I realised that for many years I couldn’t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn’t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I’d be saying things like, “It’s hard to get here, but my God it’s harder to stay here.”  'But then I woke up and thought, “After ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.”’  It seems that his son’s illness ignited this realisation that he’d become fixated on his own success. ‘I don’t have the stomach for it any more,’ he says.  ‘The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.  'I’d forgotten that it’s about souls connecting, because I’d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, “If you hadn’t done this or that, or you’d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.”  'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.  'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, “It’s my fault. I’m absolutely rubbish.”  'It affected me and I started to think, “It’s all going to go. I’m going to lose everything.”  ‘I was insecure. I’d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I’d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.  'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I’m not a mere photocopy. I’ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.  'It needed clarifying. Now I’m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that’s when it comes back to you. Like love.’  Michael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.  Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart  He blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn’t careful) and started going to the gym.  He was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.  They met again at a party and he told her, ‘You’re my wife, you just don’t know it yet. I’m going to come back and marry you.’  A year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, ‘I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father’s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.’  When he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael’s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?  ‘The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn’t as straightforward as, “My son’s recovered, I should make an album,”’ he explains. ‘I’d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.  After that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018  'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, “Come over to the house, let’s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.”  They came over, we partied and we said, “Let’s play some music.” I thought, “Wow! This is fun.”’  He takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. ‘It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago.’  He’s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents – we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.  It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago  He’s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. ‘We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he’s in my house “all the day”, as my little boy would say.’  He pauses. ‘There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,’ he says.  ‘One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.  'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending – not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up – there’s never a better time for music.’  Then suddenly he stops. ‘This is my last interview,’ he says quite solemnly. ‘I’m retiring from the business. I’ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.’  Somehow, though, I don’t think he really means it.  Michael’s album Love will be released on 16 November.

The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:"
0,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Chris Pine doesn’t see the big deal about being nude onscreen in “Outlaw King” and nearly naked in “Wonder Woman.”  “I bear the full monty [in ‘Outlaw King’] and it got a lot of attention,” Pine, 38, said on “The Graham Norton Show” on Friday. “I thought the witty reviews were brilliant, but what did strike me most is that Florence Pugh bares everything too and no one commented.”  “I am not sure what that means,” he admitted. “Either people think they can’t comment or everyone expects women to get naked. Either way, it’s double standards.”  “Outlaw King” director David McKenzie griped to Metro about the hype around Pine’s penis.  “It’s a man getting clean in a cold [lake] — you don’t do that with your clothes on,” McKenzie said. “And it’s microseconds. It’s ridiculous all the fuss about it.”  Pine previously said his nearly-nude scene in “Wonder Woman” inspired him to work out.  “I was excited,” he said of playing a naked Steve Trevor in the hit DC film. “I was like, ‘All right, man. Now the gauntlet is thrown. I’ve got something to prep for.’ It’s a 40-foot screen. If people are laughing at you doing push-ups on the set on the day, I don’t really care, because I’m going to be in Slovakia. I’ve got to prep for the Slovakians.”  He also said he didn’t mind being “objectified” by audiences of the Gal Gadot star vehicle.  “It was fun to be objectified for a day,” Pine told “Entertainment Tonight” in May 2017. “I was thinking this happens to women so, so much, it’s about time. While that was fun, I think it’s the most compassionate I’ve felt toward women on what they may feel being sidelined or made to feel less important.”"

0,"""She loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia,"" the actress recalled.  Amongst the many celebrities that we lost in 2016 was Carrie Fisher, whose portrayal of a brave rebel princess was equally as important as her interest in advocating for mental health awareness as well as women's rights. Now, Star Wars is honoring the legendary actress with a series of moving tributes created for the Star Wars Celebration event held in Orlando, Florida, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of A New Hope.  Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter, made a surprise appearance at the gala. Following George Lucas' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.  ""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""  Billie concluded her speech by reciting Leia's legendary plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The official Star Wars twitter account also posted this moving video homage to Carrie:  It was recently revealed that the late actress would, in fact, make a a posthumous appearance in Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Jedi, after her family gave Lucasfilm permission to use footage shot before her death. Episode IX will debut in theaters on May 23rd, 2019."

0,"Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak and her daughter Brielle Biermann are causing quite the stir on social media this week.  Early on Wednesday — five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat — the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.  “OMG!!! i’m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, “in the spring sometime.”  Brielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: “OMG!!! i can’t wait to meet the little nugget. it’s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.”  A few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. “Brielle’s lying!” she said. “She’s lying!”  But it’s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.  “I would love to have another little boy,” she told Us. “I am just obsessed with my boys.” The Don’t Be Tardy star added: “I’m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we’re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.”  And during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. “I have baby fever so bad,” she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: “Never say never.”  Meanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “The private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,” she wrote. “But I accidentally sent it to everyone.”  Zolciak also wants the world to know she didn’t confirm Khloé’ Kardashian’s pregnancy.  “The conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,” Zolciak said. “Everyone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.”"

After meeting at university, the pair were close pals for more than a year and lived in a shared house together before romance finally blossomed.  When asked about the moment they first laid eyes on each other, William said he would have to ""wrack his brains"" to remember it.  But Kate on the other hand remembers the moment perfectly, and it's fair to say it understandably probably wasn't her most cool and collected moment.  (Image: PA)  During the couple's engagement interview back in 2010 she recalled the moment she first saw her future husband.  She said: ""I actually went bright red when I met you and scuttled off feeling very shy about meeting you.  ""William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there from Fresher's Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other.  ""But we did become very close friends from quite early on.""  How sweet!  (Image: Getty Images Europe) (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  There were many rumours flying around at the time that Kate had a poster of the Prince on her wall - but she quickly corrected them.  She said: ""He wishes. I had the Levi guy on my wall, not a picture of William.""  Sorry Wills.  In the interview the duke and duchess also spoke about their brief split , and explained why it was so important to their relationship.  William said: ""We did split up for a bit.  ""We were both very young, it was at university and we were both finding ourselves and being different characters and stuff.  ""It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""It was just a bit of space. It worked out for the better.""  Kate admitted she wasn't happy about the break-up at the time, but in hindsight believes it was a good idea.  She said: ""At the time I wasn't very happy about it but actually it made me a stronger person.""  (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  ""You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised.  ""I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger.  ""I really valued that time, for me as well, although i didn't think it at the time."""
0,"The 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea officially kicked off on Friday, Feb. 9 with a highly-anticipated opening ceremony.  The Olympics opening ceremony, which had a theme of peace, featured K-pop (several countries marched out to BTS, and Team USA marched out to “Gangnam Style“), heated patriotic uniforms and some very cold temperatures.  Days before the event, organizers were working to stop a norovirus outbreak from spreading, ensure spectators and performers were equipped to endure freezing temperatures, and avoid exacerbating tensions among world leaders in attendance, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Here are the key details to know about the Olympics opening ceremony:  What time did the 2018 Olympics opening ceremony start?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in PyeongChang on Feb. 9, beginning at 8 p.m. local time (6 a.m. EST).  The official Winter Olympic Games schedule began Thursday, with curling and ski jumping events starting on Feb. 8.  How can I watch the Olympics opening ceremony?  Early-bird Olympic enthusiasts in the United States were able to watch the opening ceremony live beginning at 6 a.m. EST on NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app, which is available on streaming devices, including Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV. Later on Friday at 8 p.m. EST, NBC will air a “fully-produced” television broadcast of the opening ceremony, featuring interviews and commentary by hosts Katie Couric and Mike Tirico.  Where was the opening ceremony held?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in the new PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, which seats 35,000 people. The venue will be used just four times — for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Olympics and Paralympics — before being torn down. Construction of the stadium was part of the roughly $13 billion that South Korea is spending on the Olympics, the Associated Press reported.  But amid severe winter weather warnings, organizers feared that the Olympic stadium, which has no roof, might make the opening ceremony too cold for spectators to endure. Temperatures in PyeongChang this month have been falling to -4 degrees Fahrenheit at night, Reuters reported.  The forecast prompted organizers to work on measures to prevent cases of hypothermia and prepare for no-shows. Spectators were given hot packs, seat warmers, blankets, hats and windbreakers to keep warm. But temperatures at the opening ceremony were warmer than expected at 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and some athletes appeared unfazed.  What happened at the Olympics opening ceremony?  As in every Olympics opening ceremony since 1908, athletes marched into the stadium under their country’s flag during the Parade of Nations. Olympic athletes from North and South Korea marched together under a single flag — a historic diplomatic decision that caused some controversy.  Even before North and South Korea agreed to unite, organizers had planned for the Olympics opening ceremony to have a theme of peace. Korean musicians performed John Lennon’s “Imagine,” surrounded by lights in the shape of a dove.  “We have worked on all of our scenarios under the theme of peace,” Song Seung-whan, the executive creative director for the opening ceremony, said at a press conference in January, according to Reuters. “Although North Korea’s participation was decided belatedly, we think this will serve as a good opportunity for us to convey our message more clearly.”  More than a thousand drones lit up the sky in the shape of the Olympics rings, above a show that featured 1,300 performers and 700 volunteers at one point, the New York Times reported. South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim lit the Olympic cauldron after performing a short skating routine.  Pita Taufatofua — the oiled-up Tongan flag-bearer who became a social media sensation during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics — is competing in PyeongChang as a cross-country skier. He carried his country’s flag at Friday’s opening ceremony, stealing the show once again with the same shirtless uniform despite freezing temperatures.  Team USA weathered those bitter temperatures by wearing heated parkas as they paraded into the Olympic stadium. The uniforms, which feature American flags made of heat-conductive ink, were designed by Polo Ralph Lauren, the official outfitter for the 2018 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams.  Who attended the opening ceremony?  The U.S. delegation to the Olympics is led by Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the opening ceremony with his wife, Karen Pence. The delegation also includes California Rep. Ed Royce and 2002 Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes. Joining them are Gen. Vincent Brooks, who commands the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea; his predecessor, Gen. James Thurman; and Marc Knapper, a diplomat currently leading the U.S. embassy in Seoul.  Earlier in the day, Pence met with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier — the father of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea. Fred Warmbier had also been scheduled to attend the opening ceremony as Pence’s guest, the Washington Post reported. The Warmbiers attended this year’s State of the Union address by President Trump, who pointed to them as “powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world.”  Kim Jong Un sent his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, to the opening ceremony as part of the North Korean delegation, which is led by Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea’s parliament. The unprecedented visit marked the first time an immediate member of the Kim family has been to South Korea. It’s not clear if any of the North Korean representatives will meet Pence or other U.S. officials at the Olympics, though they were seated near each other at the opening ceremony. “We’ll have to see what happens,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said when asked about it on Monday, according to Reuters.  Meanwhile, President Trump and Kim Jong Un were represented at the opening ceremony by two impersonators in the stands, who caused a stir and were asked to leave.

0,"The daughter of one of the most fashionable forces to be reckoned with would naturally have a pretty eye-catching engagement ring — and Bee Shaffer did not disappoint when she debuted her rock on the red carpet on Monday night.  The 29-year-old daughter recently got engaged to 34-year-old Francesco Carrozzini — who, as the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, is also fashion family royalty — and the lovebirds made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala.  Bee certainly looked stunning in her silk Alexander McQueen floor-sweeper, which featured a patchwork of painted designs — but it was her bling that was the most noteworthy item of her ensemble.  Rockin' that rock! Bee Shaffer showed off her engagement ring on the red carpet for the first time on Monday night  In love: The 29-year-old also made her red carpet debut with her fiancé, Francesco Carrozzini  Lover here! Though her necklace and earrings were undoubtedly pricey, it was her diamond - encircled by smaller diamonds and set in yellow gown - that was the most eye-catching  Striking: She wore a patchwork Alexander McQueen number for the occasion  The public first found out that Bee was engaged in March, thanks to an Instagram photo that offered viewers a glimpse at the ring.  Shared in her friend Selby Drummond's Instagram Story, the black-and-white snap showed Bee trying on some shoes in what appears to be a fashion closet at Vogue, and added the hashtag #francescoblackandwhite — a hashtag Francesco uses often on his own Instagram.  Eagle-eyed 'grammers caught the flash of diamond in the snap, at Vogue later confirmed the news.  Now, a month and a half later, the duo has gone totally public, walking together on the red carpet at the Met Gala.  Love-dovey: Her husband-to-bee, Francesco, kept her close as they posed for the camera  Surprise! The two got engaged earlier this year and had been secretly dating for a while  Offspring: Francesco is the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Carrozzini  Francesco, in a blue tux, kept his wife to be close with hand around her waist as they face the photographers. Bee, meanwhile, occasionally posed with her left hand on her hip, offering the cameras an obscured look at her diamond.  The ring features an unusually think, flat yellow gold setting and a large, round center stone, which is surrounded by 14 smaller stones.  Whether the ring is by a famous jeweler or a family heirloom is as yet unknown.  Basking in their first appearance since agreeing to get hitched, the couple walked the carpet toward the Wintour Costume Center, which was re-named after the Vogue editrix in 2014.  Iconic: Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour opted for a multi-textured dress that featured sequins, fur and embroidery  All hail: The Met Gala chair dazzled in her gown as her daughter took the carpet with Francesco  Bee's mom Anna, meanwhile, wore a custom Chanel dress covered in glitzy sequins. As is her habit, the host eschewed the theme — Rei Kawakubo/Commes Des Garcons: Art of the In-Between — and stuck to her signature classic, feminine style.  She finished off her look with a chunky necklace, a pretty pink lip, and her trademark sleek bob — choosing, wisely, to leave her infamous dark sunglasses at home for the ritzy occasion.  Bee and her husband-to-be were first linked just last year, soon before his mother, Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, passed away in December following a year-long illness.  Stunning: Bee made quite the impression as she showed off the long train of her dress on the stairs leading up to the gala event  Whoops! News of their engagement was made public in March when a friend shared this picture of Bee - and her ring - on her Instagram story  Franca, who died before Christmas at the age of 66, had edited Italian Vogue since 1988, taking up the position in the same month that Anna took over Vogue in the US.  Anna wrote a heartfelt letter of remembrance after Franca's passing, saying of her friend: 'Franca was warm, clever, funny, and someone who could give the Sphinx a run for its money when it comes to keeping a confidence.  'She was also the hardest-working person I have known, and with an envy-inducing ease with multitasking.'"

0,"Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. “I’m sorry you feel that way … I thought it turned out incredible,” he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The “race” constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark’s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than César Cielo’s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.  Regardless of Phelps’ abilities, Discovery’s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers’ sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:  Turns out “Michael Phelps races a shark” was really just “Michael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark’s time.” — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017  Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB — Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017  Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform — Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017  “All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn’t a side by side race,” said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. “During Michael’s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‘Phelps vs. Shark,’ this message was clear.”  Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. “I’m sorry you feel that way … It’s hard to swim in a cage when you’re next to a shark … It wouldn’t be able to move at the right speed. So how we did it was the best way that we could do it.”  While the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of great white sharks (just check out this GIF of Phelps reacting to how easily a great white would win gold). Even though Phelps lost by a hair in this would-be race, to Phelps’ credit, he could take down a reef shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds.  “Rematch?” Phelps tweeted after “losing” to the ocean predator. But the real question: would anyone bother to watch?"

On Friday, Taylor deleted all previous posts and her profile pictures from her Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  Even Taylor’s website was a blank space!  Now she’s posted a 10 second dark video with no audio of what looks like an animal’s tail.  What does it all mean? Another album? We're not sure yet but it's certainly whipped fans into a frenzy!  Taylor has avoided the public eye ever since her spat with Kanye West and break up with British actor Tom Hiddleston.  Swift’s last album was 2014’s ‘1989’, her last single was her ‘I Don’t Wanna Live Forever’ collab with ZAYN in January for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack."
0,"“Once Upon a Time” is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show’s upcoming series finale.  Former “Once Upon a Time” stars Jennifer Morrison, Ginner Goodwin, Josh Dallas, and Emilie de Ravin have all been confirmed to return for the show’s final episode, which is set to air on May 18.  All four of the actors departed the ABC fairy tale series after its sixth season. Morrison played Emma Swan in the series, while Goodwin played Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. Dallas starred as Prince Charming/David Nolan, and de Ravin played Belle/Lacey.  The four are the latest former cast members to book returns for the show’s finale. Previously, Tony Amendola, Lee Arenberg, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Robbie Kay, Sean Maguire, Victoria Smurfit, Keegan Tracy, Beverley Elliott, and Jared Gilmore were all confirmed to appear in the final two episodes.  ABC announced in February that “Once Upon a Time’s” seventh season would be the show’s last. The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season. The show also moved from its longtime Sunday night timeslot to Fridays, where it has suffered a noticeable ratings decline. Season 7 is currently averaging a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers, down over 40% in the demo and over 20% in total viewers from Season 6."

0,"“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.  One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.  The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”"
1,"Erin Jensen  USA TODAY  Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.  “I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago. Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.  Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?  The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.  “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”  He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”  “There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  Valid point, Mr. Theroux.

1,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.  “A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”  The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.  A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”  According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.  The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.  Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained."
1,"Fans believe Taylor Swift's single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" targets Kanye West. Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:  Kanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift's album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother's death.  In response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.  The plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.  Around 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.    Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released — it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.  Though Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.  The subreddit that started it all. Reddit  ""Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim's Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye's font and cover art style for her new album 'Reputation.' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye's mother, Donda West's death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor's songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.""  Not content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit . Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish.  The post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there's an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, ""Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day"" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just ""Hey Mama"" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around."
1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports."
1,"I don't know who is more excited about Khloé's new baby: The Kardashian family or me. (Probably the family, but it might actually be a close call.) By now you've most definitely heard that on April 12, TMZ reported Khloé Kardashian gave birth to her daughter and wow, I feel so emotional just writing that. Don't judge... Kardashian babies just bring it out in me, OK? But now that Kardashian's baby has arrived, the world is so, so happy about it, and of course, the Kardashians' reactions to Khloé Kardashian's baby make me want to cry tears of pure joy. There is too much love, you guys.  UPDATE 2: Kim Kardashian also opened up about Khloé giving birth. She tweeted on April 13, ""@khloekardashian I’m so happy for you! Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy! I can’t wait for our baby girls to grow up as best friends the way we are! I’m so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL."" She also tweeted, ""You guys she’s so gorgeous!!!!!""  UPDATE 1: Kylie Jenner has also sent her congratulations to her big sister on the birth of her baby girl. Jenner posted a photo to Snapchat using a filter that read, ""Kongrats, Khloé! It's a girl!""  EARLIER: Before we dive into the Kardashian love-fest, let's go back to where it all began: That fateful day of Dec. 20, 2017, when Khloé Kardashian gave the world a Christmas miracle in the form of an Instagram post confirming her pregnancy.  She wrote,  My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love!  I will never *not* cry at this announcement, TBH.  As if she didn't do enough simply by sharing her pregnancy, she went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and discussed potential name ideas, though at the time, she had no clue whether she was having a boy or a girl. ""I think if it's a boy I'll go with Tristan Junior,"" she said, adding, ""For a girl I don't even know where to begin. I think I'll go with a K or a T name though.""  The video, which you can check out below, had me screaming:  God bless Khloé Kardashian.  We of course know Kardashian revealed her baby's sex on the season finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, telling her family and fans that she was expecting a little girl:  And then wrote the sweetest message on Twitter, feeling very fortunate to be having a little lady. She wrote,  I am now so excited my daughter will have forever best friends with Chicago and Stormi!! God is great!!! Thank you Lord for our princess  Fans loved seeing Kardashian's reaction about the reveal. Too sweet for words.  When reports first came out that Kardashian gave birth, the entire world collectively screamed and cried tears of joy. Many took to Twitter to express how excited they were.  But the most excited were obviously her siblings and her mom, Kris Jenner. Jenner posted a video of Kendall Jenner repeating the word ""baby,"" that was originally posted by W Magazine. The original caption read, ""When three of your sisters give birth in under a year. Congratulations to @KhloeKardashian on welcoming another girl to the KarJenner clan."" Jenner reposted it, writing, ""BLESSED!!!""  Kourtney Kardashian also posted an Instagram to her page that showed North West, Penelope Disick, and Tracy Romulus' daughter. The caption read, ""GIRL POWER."" This caption could be a tiny clue that Kourtney was celebrating the birth of Khloé's daughter and the sisterhood that is their family.  I am seriously swooning right now.  I love how all the Kardashians are so supportive of one another and so excited for all of the new arrivals in their family as of late (looking at you, Chicago West and Stormi Webster).  A big congratulations to Kardashian and the whole crew!"

The specifics?

1,"Getty  After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.  A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun."
1,"The ongoing rumors about Brad Pitt and his ex-wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, continue to swirl regarding a supposed reconciliation between the former couple. The claims have only intensified ever since Jennifer Aniston and her husband of two years, actor Justin Theroux, called it quits recently.  While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to work their way through a very challenging time, involving their own divorce and custody battle over their six children, the pair has been constantly linked to various rumored new loves. Despite Pitt having been falsely linked to a list of beauties, Jennifer Aniston has remained the most frequent female celeb to be rumored as spending time with the heartthrob.  Now the focus is on how Angelina Jolie is reacting to the rumored reconciliation between Pitt and his former wife, Aniston. Reports swirl that Angelina and Jen are gearing up for a showdown over the Allied star and that Pitt is ""freaking out"" over the drama that his and Aniston's supposed closeness has resulted in.  New Idea shares alleged details relayed by a source on the lengthy love triangle between the three. The insider relays that Jen and Angelina have already spoken about the big night that will see the trio in the same room, along with anyone who's anyone in Hollywood and film. The three will all attend the Oscars and the women are said to have discussed boundaries for the occasion that could result in a ""showdown"" between Jen and Angelina.  ""Word is Jen and Angie had a major discussion about the Oscars. It's the biggest night of the year, and they know they'll both be party-hopping,"" the insider states. ""However, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, 'neither are willing to budge an inch,' resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other – something neither are very happy about,"" the publication continues.  The star ex-husband to both these talented beauties is reportedly quite stressed out about the potential words that will be exchanged at one of the entertainment industry's most formal and important events.  ""I heard he's frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs – no good could possibly come from it,"" the insider claims.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently announced their separation in a joint statement, within which the pair stated that they will carry on as friends and to not believe any stories that are making the rounds, reminding that what comes from them is the only truth.  This has not stopped fabrications from swirling. The rumors even now go so far as to say that Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux have met up to find comfort and plot against Jen and Brad over their said reconciliation. This, however, has been debunked and is not to be believed, as Gossip Cop has informed readers.  This latest claim is yet to be verified, and if there is tension between the trio, the stars will likely keep their personal matters out of the prestigious event on Sunday."
1,"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger."
1,"Play video content 9/16/17  6:39 PM PT -- Sources who have seen the video tell TMZ there are several clips. The first appears to show a woman and Kevin in a club getting cozy. The tape then cuts to a bed, where you don't see the people in the bed ... but hear creaking and what could be people having sex. You never see Kevin in the 2nd clip. The 3rd clip shows 2 people milling around a room, one of them looks vaguely like Kevin.  We're told the person allegedly extorting Kevin has demanded payment from him to avoid the tape's release.  Kevin Hart is getting out in front of a messy situation by apologizing publicly to his wife and kids, and TMZ has learned it's all over a video that looks like he's cheating.  Kevin profusely apologized to his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, and his kids on Instagram Saturday ... saying he recently made some mistakes he deeply regrets.  Sources tell TMZ a woman has allegedly demanded money from Kevin after shooting a video with him in which Kevin and the woman are engaged in ""sexually suggestive"" conduct. We are told it is NOT a sex tape, but looks like it is a prelude to sex. We're told that at a point in the tape when the action is the heaviest, you cannot actually see Kevin."

1,"What’s the key to a successful marriage? A killer engagement ring, perhaps? Brides-to-be Miley Cyrus, Miranda Kerr, Serena Williams, and more were not shy about flaunting their bling!  Not to sound totally shallow, but isn’t the engagement ring just as important as the man giving it to you? In Sex & The City, Carrie Bradshaw actually THREW UP when she saw the hideous ring Aiden Shaw bought for her. That’s not exactly the best way to start the next chapter in your life. Ergo, there’s tons of pressure on dudes to buy the right diamond, the right cut, and the right band. Oh, and the right proposal plan. It may not be easy, but hunks like Liam Hemsworth, Evan Spiegel, and more totally nailed it with their girlfriends!  This year was FULL of romantic proposals! The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they’ll be headed down the alter. Of course we’re talking Miley Cyrus and Liam! Love is officially alive and well again now that these two are back together and head over heels. The “Malibu” singer has been mum about a wedding date, but we hope it’s in the near future!  While some engagements were to be expected, like Miranda Kerr and her CEO founder boyfriend, others were completely out of the blue! Lady Gaga is reportedly engaged to Christian Carino — and they’ve only been dating for about six months! We have not seen a diamond ring from Mother Monster yet, but we can’t wait to catch a first glimpse when she’s ready to share the amazing news with fans. Another big congratulations goes out to reality star Cardi B and rapper Migos, whose engagement news broke just a week ago. So many beautiful weddings to look forward to!  HollywoodLifers, did any of these engagements surprise you? Which proposal story do you think is the cutest?"

1,"Congratulations are in order for Miranda Kerr. The supermodel announced on Wednesday, November 15, that she is expecting a baby with her husband of six months, Evan Spiegel.  This will be the second child for the 34-year-old, who shares custody of son, Flynn, 6, with her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom.  “Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,” a spokesperson tells Us Weekly.  Kerr and the Snapchat founder, 27, were married at their home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood on May 27. They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom “Marry Me” Snapchat filter. “I said yes!!!” wrote the former Victoria’s Secret Angel on Instagram.  Despite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel’s maturity. “He’s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.’s] Venice,” she told The Edit in 2016. “He comes home early. We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”  Kerr once said that parenting Flynn is “the most rewarding thing” she’s ever done. “It has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “Being a working mother is challenging because . . . I never want to leave him — but it’s important to teach your child the value of working.”"
1,"Despite what fans may have heard, Justin Theroux is still getting over his breakup from Jennifer Aniston, a source tells ET.  Rumors have been swirling this week that the 46-year-old actor-writer is dating Petra Collins after his Instagram followers took notice of a photo he posted of himself with the 25-year-old artist back in February. Theroux shared the pic on the same day he was photographed at the Adam Selman show during New York Fashion Week.  ""Justin is still heartbroken,"" a source tells ET, adding that Theroux is not one to play the field but rather prefers to be in a relationship and is still reeling over the fact that his marriage to Aniston did not work out.  Meanwhile, another source tells ET that the former Leftovers star has been relying on his friends to help him cope with the breakup, and notes that Theroux ""had a nice time"" during his ""guys' trip"" to Paris, France, earlier this month.  When abroad, the newly single star attended the Louis Vuitton runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and while his pals might have been eager to hit the town and flirt with women, Theroux was friendly rather than flirty, according to the source.  Getty Images  A third source tells ET that Theroux is, however, ready for ""his next phase in life.""  As for his relationship with Collins, the third source says the two met through Selena Gomez when ""they all hung out together.""  ""She is artsy and edgy and loves the New York nightlife,"" the source says of Collins before calling out that Gomez -- who's also friendly with Aniston -- recently unfollowed the artist on Instagram.  Despite his apparent heartbreak, the source says Theroux is confident that his breakup with the 49-year-old actress was the right decision as their relationship had been ""going south for a long time.""  “He felt confined by their relationship. He wasn't interested with Jen's everyday scheduled life of yoga classes, eating healthy,” the source continues. “Justin is a free spirit and loves his time alone. Justin had a need for independence.”  Reporting by Darla Murray and Adriane Schwartz.

1,"Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth on Her 63rd Birthday  Ken McKay/ITV/REX / Shutterstock.com  Ellen DeGeneres turned 63 on Jan. 26. On her special day this year, she hosted Inauguration poet sensation Amanda Gorman, was treated to a multicolor birthday cocktail created by chef José Andrés of World Central Kitchen, and shared her advice for celebrating a birthday during a pandemic.  The embattled world-famous talk show host typically dedicates an entire episode of her show to the special occasion — including gifts for her audience and cameos by iconic celebrity friends. But this year she addressed a virtual studio audience, promising a “do-over” for the pandemic birthday next year. “As soon as this thing is over, we get two birthdays,” she said. “That means two cakes and two presents per guest, and two hangovers.”  Those fortunate enough to be in the audience for DeGeneres’ birthday show in the past have received Netflix gift cards that covered five years of the subscription service, $300 Lyft rideshare service gift cards and a three-day, two-night stay at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess hotel.  DeGeneres is still struggling to bounce back from a rocky 2020, in which her show was dogged by allegations of a toxic work culture. She’s also only recently recovered from COVID-19, which she contracted in December 2020.  More From Your Money  Find Out: The Richest Celebrity From Every State  Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth: $370 Million  DeGeneres’ net worth is estimated to be roughly $370 million, according to Forbes (though by some estimates it’s as high as $500M). In 2020, DeGeneres made $84 million, retaining the No. 12 spot on Forbes’ list of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. Her wife — actress Portia de Rossi — has her own $50 million fortune, which brings the celebrity couple’s total net worth to $420 million.  Starting out as a stand-up comedian, DeGeneres rose to fame as an actress, starring in the TV series “Ellen” from 1994 to 1998 and “The Ellen Show” from 2001 to 2002. Her daytime talk show, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” debuted on Sept. 8, 2003, and had consistently high ratings until the recent controversies. Upon her return to the show in September, her season premier ratings dropped 29% from the previous season, Variety reported. In 2015, “The Ellen Show” won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. According to Celebrity Net Worth, DeGeneres receives an estimated annual salary of between $75 million and $90 million.  DeGeneres has hosted the Oscars twice, both in 2007 and in 2014. She made history during the 2014 gig by tweeting a group selfie with a gaggle of famous friends, including Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey — a photo that has received more than 3 million retweets since being posted.  DeGeneres famously voiced the character Dory in the 2003 Pixar films “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory.” She’s also found major success behind the camera with her own production company A Very Good Production.  Whoa: 50 Highest-Grossing Actors of All Time  Ellen DeGeneres’ Business Ventures  The tech-savvy superstar launched the site Ellentube in 2014, which hosts exclusive video content from her talk show. In 2015, she also partnered with Vessel to debut one or two clips from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on the streaming site before they’re available anywhere else.  DeGeneres has also ventured into the beauty and fashion world. In 2009, she became the face of COVERGIRL. She also previously served as the spokeswoman for JCPenney and American Express. And her lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen — including clothing, accessories and home decor — launched in 2015.  In late 2017, DeGeneres also debuted a new game show titled “Ellen’s Game of Games” on NBC, expanding the popular games which have been previously featured on her talk show.  More From Your Money  Big Tippers: 10 Celebs Who’ve Left Generous Tips  Ellen DeGeneres’ Real Estate Portfolio  DeGeneres and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 28-year-old.  The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. The couple also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.  In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — DeGeneres sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a California home in 2007 for $20 million, which was later the site of Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.  The total number of properties currently owned by the couple is unknown. DeGeneres released her interior design book “Home” in 2015, which included photos and design tips from many of their past and present residences. Their former Thousand Oaks, Calif. ranch — which they sold in 2013 for $10.85 million — was also previously featured in Elle Décor.  There’s Time: Samuel L. Jackson and 34 Other Celebrities Who Got Rich and Famous Later in Life  Ellen DeGeneres’ Honors and Awards  In November 2016, President Obama presented DeGeneres with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “It’s easy to forget now just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages 20 years ago,” Obama said.
