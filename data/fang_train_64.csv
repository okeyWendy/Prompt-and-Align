0,"This afternoon, an apparent ISIS supporter tweeted the above image along with the text “O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS,” and some in the right-wing media reported that the tweet constituted an advance warning about the deadly attack. The only problem: It was posted long after the shooting began.  Here’s a screencap via Rob Bettis:  Reporting of ISIS tweet is inaccurate. Tweet is time stamped 10:34 *PT* (1:34 ET). 2 hrs after the event.#CHAshooti… pic.twitter.com/KDE8o0cMj9 July 16, 2015  Twitter user @K_H_O7777777777—whose account was suspended this afternoon—published the tweet at 1:34 p.m. Eastern Time, roughly three hours after Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing at a military recruiting center this morning, killing four Marines. Nonetheless, the hysterically anti-Islam blogger Pamela Geller published a post about the hours-late “warning,” and as Mediaite notes, Fox News’ Catherine Herridge said that @K_H_O7777777777 “seemed to have foreknowledge about the shooting” on-air.  [There was a video here]  Geller and Herridge may want to take a closer look at Twitter’s time-zone function. A screencap of the tweet that’s making the rounds on right-wing Twitter does show a 10:34 a.m. timestamp, but that’s only because it was taken somewhere in the Pacific Time Zone, and Twitter displays time stamps in local time."

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist serving with Hamilton’s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment, was shot dead while guarding the National War Memorial. The gunman, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was later shot dead inside the main Parliament building.  You can watch the speeches and read the text, based in part on prepared remarks, of each of their addresses below.  Stephen Harper  PM speaks on Ottawa shooting News 6:56 Raw video from Stephen Harper 6:56  ""My fellow Canadians: for the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil.  Today our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Cpl. Cirillo was killed today — murdered in cold blood — as he provided a ceremonial honour guard at Canada's National War Memorial, that sacred place that pays tribute to those who gave their lives so that we can live in a free, democratic and safe society.  Likewise, our thoughts and prayers remain also with the family and friends of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired terrorist.  Tonight, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these despicable attacks.  Fellow Canadians, we've also been reminded today of the compassionate and courageous nature of so many Canadians -- like those private citizens and first responders who came to provide aid to Cpl. Cirillo as he fought for his life.  And, of course, the members of our security forces — in the RCMP, the City of Ottawa police and in Parliament — who came quickly and at great risk to themselves to assist those of us who were close to the attack.  Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.  We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values. on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.  But let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.  While today has been without question a difficult day, I have every confidence that Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our country through many challenges.  Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us. For now, Laureen and Ben and Rachel and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched by today's attack. May God bless them and keep our land glorious and free.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair  Opposition speaks about Ottawa shooting News 5:38 Raw video from Tom Mulcair 5:38  [The first four and a half lines of the text below are from prepared remarks that were not caught on video in the CBC broadcast above.]  ""Good evening my fellow Canadians. Today the peace of our nation's capital was shattered by an act of hatred and brutality -- cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, at the heart of who we are.  But I'm here tonight in solidarity, side-by-side with my colleagues, with our Prime Minister and with all Canadians.  This attack struck with sudden and deadly violence. It was carried out on the very ground where we come together to exchange ideas with the knowledge that whatever our differences, we will always resolve them peacefully.  It was intended to make us more fearful of our neighbours and less confident in ourselves. But it has failed. Today's events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.  And to the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces, I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and, indeed, your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.  Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone here in our nation's capital are with the family and loved ones of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Forces member from Hamilton, Ont., who lost his life this morning — the second in just a few days.  Cpl. Cirillo was literally standing on guard at a monument dedicated to the sacrifice of others who came before him. To his family and friends, I tell you that 35 million Canadians at home and abroad from coast to coast to coast and around the world stand with you tonight, and we will not forget.  In this moment, Canadians are unified in grief and stricken with disbelief. Canada is shaken today, but we shall not waver. We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow, we will do the same.  These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate. They will not. We will stand up, we will stand together. We will persevere, and we will prevail.  Good evening.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau  Liberal leader speaks about Ottawa shooting News 10:18 Raw video from Justin Trudeau 10:18  ""My fellow Canadians: I’m speaking to you from a Parliament Hill just coming out of lockdown. I am deeply saddened by today’s horrific events here in Ottawa and unreservedly condemn these brutal and heartless acts of violence. This attack is unforgivable. Should any other perpetrators or co-conspirators exist, they must be caught and be punished to the full force of our laws.  I’ve extended an offer of full support to the government along with any assistance members of our party can provide at this time. My thoughts and prayers, along with those of my colleagues, go out to the family and friends of the victims of today’s horrific shooting, including Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, who was standing dutifully, guarding one of our nation’s most sacred monuments.  It was a cowardly act — an unarmed man was murdered in cold blood, at close range. Words cannot express this deep sadness we feel over his loss. To the brave women and men who rushed to the scene to confront the shooter and to help keep us safe, I say only, 'Thank you. Thank you for your selfless courage and your professionalism in this time of crisis.'  In the days that follow, there will be questions, anger and perhaps confusion. This is natural, but we cannot let this get the better of us. Losing ourselves to fear and speculation is the intention of those who commit these heinous acts. They mean to shake us. We will remain resolved. They want us to forget ourselves. Instead, we will remember. We will remember who we are.  We are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.  Our dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.  Criminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.  Today, some speak of the loss of innocence in Canada. This is inaccurate. Canada is not and has never been innocent to the threats we face. And we know, as we have always known, that we are not immune. What is true is that we have never let those threats shape us, and we have never bowed to those who mean to undermine our values and our way of life. We have remained Canadians, and this is how we will carry on.  We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack. And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith. Continued mutual co-operation and respect will help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.  We will walk forward together, not apart.  In the coming days, we will be inundated with pictures and videos showing what happened today. But there is one in particular we should all remember: the picture in our minds we have of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians. That is who we truly are, and it is who we shall continue to be.  Good night."""

During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.  ""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""  The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week’s events.  Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.  Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.  Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board.

However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.

Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.  A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.

The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.  The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.  Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman.

0,"When contractors came in to replace the chalkboards at a high school in Oklahoma, they thought they would find a few problems in the walls. Instead, they found a hidden treasure of sorts: Chalkboards dating back almost 100 years.  ""I got goosebumps, and then I got tears in my eyes,"" said Sherry Kishore, the principal at Emerson High School in Oklahoma City. ""It was like walking into a time capsule.""  The century-old chalkboards were found underneath the current boards that were being replaced by the school to make way for more modern whiteboards.  Among the vibrantly coloured images displayed on the old chalkboards: a girl dressed in bright pink petting the tail of a turkey; cursive handwriting of the American Pledge of Allegiance; and a calendar with 1917 written above it.  The Oklahoma City Public School District believe the students were learning about pilgrims because every board has a similar lesson on them.  ""When you walk into these rooms, it's like they just left the lesson and they’re expecting to come back the next day and start again,"" Kishore said.  The district says it will preserve the lessons, so others can have the same feeling of taking a step back in time.  There's no definitive proof that the boards are from 1917 beyond the calendar written on the board.  But if they are, the chalkboards would have been installed only 28 years after the founding of Oklahoma City in 1889.  The discovery is a miracle given the city's location in the eye of Tornado Alley, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. The U.S. National Weather Service says tornadoes have hit the city more than 150 times since 1890.  Now the chalkboards that once taught history to students will be used to show the history of a time long passed for the community.  ""I think seeing this reminds them how far we've come,"" Kishore said. ""And actually [that's] what teaching is all about."""
0,"DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.  In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.  In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.  French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.  The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.  The U.S. on Friday issued a worldwide travel alert warning that terrorists could target Westerners. French authorities Friday were trying to establish whether any of the attackers had ties to extremist Islamist groups in France or abroad.  The gunman at the grocery store, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, is believed to be connected to the Kouachi brothers, authorities said. French police were hunting for a woman they say was an accomplice, Hayat Boumeddiene. Five people connected to the attackers are still being held by authorities, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.  Explosions and gunfire rang out in both places — at the printing factory in the countryside town of Dammartin-en-Goele and at the kosher market in Paris — in what the French hoped was a conclusion to the spasm of terror that has gripped France for more than two days.  One hostage was freed at the printing factory, authorities said. At the market, four hostages were killed and 15 were freed, according to Israeli government officials who spoke to their French counterparts. The four dead hostages were killed by the gunman before the police raid, Molins said. Four officers were injured, including one who was seriously hurt.  In a speech to the country, President Francois Hollande thanked the security forces for their professionalism. He said that the threat of terrorism was not over, but he said France had overcome its challenge.  ""We are free when we are not afraid,"" he said. ""We carry an idea that is bigger than ourselves, and we are able to defend it everywhere where peace is threatened.""  He cautioned against racism and called for a national march of unity on Sunday. He described the hostage siege at the kosher market as ""a terrible anti-Semitic act.""  U.S. officials have said that Said Kouachi, 34, trained with al Qaeda in Yemen several years ago, and his younger brother was convicted on a terrorism charge in 2008. They had been on the run since speeding away from the magazine’s offices after the attack on Wednesday.  The brothers were spotted Friday by police driving in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 20 miles outside the capital, at about 9:30 a.m. local time, or 3:30 a.m. ET. A gunfight broke out, and the brothers apparently holed up in the nearest building they could find, a family-owned printing business, taking a company manager hostage. Said Kouachi was shot in the throat during the gunfight, Molins said.  Yves Albarello, a French lawmaker, was quoted by the French TV station i-Tele as saying that the Kouachi brothers had told police they wanted to “die as martyrs.” The report could not be confirmed by NBC News.  Hours later came word of a second siege at the kosher market. It was not clear how many people were inside, but Thibeaut, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman, suggested there were many because it was the morning before the Jewish Sabbath, which begins Friday night.  Many ambulances were outside the market, and police asked all businesses nearby to close.  The Associated Press, citing an unnamed police official, reported that the gunman had threatened to kill hostages if police stormed the printing plant 25 miles away.  Authorities locked down schools near Dammartin-en-Goele. At one, the Lycee Charles de Gaulle, about 500 students were being kept inside.  “We are all scared,” one student, Angelina Monzili, 16, told NBC News. “We came to school expecting a normal day. We were told that the terrorists are really close. Our families are worried about us. We saw police cars flying past, and ambulances.”  People who live in the area were to told to stay away from windows, turn off lights and stay indoors. “It’s basically a war zone in Dammartin-en-Goele,” one witness told BFM TV.  Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France as the twin dramas played out.  Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport told NBC News that some aircraft coming into land had been redirected to its southern two runways, which are further away from Dammartin-en-Goele. “The town is a little bit too close to the airport,” a spokesman said.  In the tense hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, profiles began to emerge of the Kouachi brothers, who were known to French and American counterterrorism officials.  Two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News that Said Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be trained by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is considered the most violent branch of the terror network.  Cherif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to prison in 2008 after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers had been on the U.S. no-fly list “for years.”  A purported member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed in a Twitter message that the group directed the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to Flashpoint Intelligence, a global security firm and an NBC News counterterrorism consultant.  During the siege, Cherif Kouachi spoke by telephone to a French television station, saying he ""was sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda"" and had been financed by the group's leader, Anwar al-Awlaki before Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.  The final gun battle began after the brothers emerged from the printing factory and started shooting, Molins said. Security forces returned fire, killing them. Their hostage, the company manager, escaped unharmed. It later turned out that a second plant employee had been hiding under a sink, undetected during the entire ordeal.  Investigators found ammunition and heavy weapons in the factory, including a rocket launcher, Molins said.  On Thursday, elite anti-terrorist forces converged on several villages after two masked robbers with machine guns matching the Kouachi brothers' description held up a gas station in Villers-Cotteret, France.  Charlie Hebdo’s offices had been firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The publication’s chief editor — who was known as Charb — was an outspoken supporter of free speech who had reportedly been put on an al Qaeda hit list. He was among those slain.  NBC News' Alexander Smith, Nikolai Miller, Jason Cumming, Richard Engel, Robert Windrem and Pete Williams, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Nancy Ing reported from Paris.

0,"The owners of an Oregon bakery must pay $135,000 in damages for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, a state official ruled on Thursday.  Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian agreed with a preliminary ruling that Sweet Cakes by Melissa illegally discriminated against a Portland couple in 2013 by turning down their request based on their sexual orientation, The Oregonian reported.  A judge had ordered owners Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay $75,000 in damages to Rachel Bowman-Crye and another $60,000 to her wife, Laurel Bowman-Cryer.  The Kleins had argued it was against their Christians beliefs to participate in a same-sex marriage. Supporters raised money for them earlier this year after an administrative law judge imposed the penalty.  The Bowman-Cryers, through their attorney Paul Thompson, said in a statement they were glad Avakian sent ""a clear message that discrimination will simply not be tolerated in our state.""  ""This has been a terrible ordeal for our entire family. We never imagined finding ourselves caught up in a fight for social justice,"" they said.  ""We endured daily, hateful attacks on social media, received death threats and feared for our family's safety, yet our goal remained steadfast. We were determined to ensure that this kind of blatant discrimination never happened to another couple, another family, another Oregonian,"" the statement continued. ""Everyone deserves to be treated as an equal member of society.""  An email to HuffPost, the bakery said the decision was wrong, adding, ""Americans should tolerate diverse opinions, not use the government to punish fellow citizens with different views. This case has become a poster for an overpowered elected official using his position to root out thought and speech with which he personally disagrees.""  The owners vowed in a Facebook post to appeal the decision:  ""The final ruling has been made today. We have been charged with $135,000 in emotional damages, But also now Aaron has been charged with advertising. (Basically talking about not wanting to participate in a same-sex wedding) This effectively strips us of all our first amendment rights. According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. We will NOT give up this fight, and we will NOT be silenced. We stand for God's truth, God's word and freedom for ALL americans. We are here to obey God not man, and we will not conform to this world. If we were to lose everything it would be totally worth it for our Lord who gave his one and only son, Jesus, for us! God will win this fight.  The Sweet Cakes website features quotations from Biblical passages, such as, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight"" from the book of Proverbs. It also explicitly states the bakery is interested in baking for weddings between a man and a woman.  ""We here at Sweet Cakes strongly believe that when a man and woman come together to be joined as one, it is truly one of the most special days of their lives,"" the homepage said.

0,"Washington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Monday by the Obama Administration which states a new law that will take effect March 1, 2016 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.  The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.  In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.  This bill has faced extreme backlash from conservative groups as well as Republican presidential hopefuls. Donald Trump mentioned in a statement that if he is elected president he will immediately revoke this new law putting the age of consent across the country to 18 years of age."
0,"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., looks on as he walks along his tour of the National Gypsum plant Sunday, Feb. 24, 2008, in Lorain, Ohio. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)  Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support  LORAIN, Ohio (AP) — Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary.  At the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal ""would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.""  One day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words.  ""Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,"" Obama said. ""Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America — and I never have.""  ""The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,"" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland.  ""A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, ""I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,"" he said.  The trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.  Ohio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.  Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.  On another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.  Asked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.""  He also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war ""in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed"" or were sent into the war zone without enough training.  Polls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.  Given that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.  At the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.  He said Clinton has ""essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.""  On Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals ""unless they are positive for American workers.""  To an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.  ""Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,"" he said. ""But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas."""

Dr Anne Aly, an expert in homegrown terrorism at Curtin University who sits on the Council for Australian-Arab Relations, believes the gunman is indeed a lone actor, without training or support from a wider terrorist network.  ""There's a trend of lone opportunistic actors"", she told VICE News. ""We used to talk about terrorist cells, but now rather than individual cells we have lone actors taking things into their own hands. They're inspired by groups such as IS and they think they're contributing to that group.""  ""But what we've seen in the past,"" Aly continued, ""is this is how groups end.

0,"SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA (BNO NEWS) — Gunmen are holding more than a dozen hostages at a cafe in Sydney’s main business area, local media reported on Monday, with local television stations airing images of hostages pressed against windows while holding a black flag with Arabic writing.  The crisis began just before 10 a.m. local time when at least two gunmen entered the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at Martin Place in Sydney’s main business area. Channel 7, which said its newsroom near the cafe had been evacuated, reported that at least thirteen hostages had been taken, including staff and customers.  Images shown by local media organizations showed hostages pressed against windows while holding up a black flag with Islamic writing, saying “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” The flag is not specifically associated with the Islamic State (ISIS) group, as was reported on social media.  New South Wales (NSW) police confirmed a major police operation was underway in the city’s main business area, and said a number of streets as well as Martin Place train station had been shut down. “Police are dealing with an armed incident and specialist officers are attempting to make contact those inside a café,” the force said in a statement.  The area surrounding the chocolate cafe was immediately evacuated after the crisis began, with heavily armed police taking positions nearby. Authorities ordered those in streets bordering Martin Place to remain indoors and away from open windows, and asked others in the area but further away to leave their buildings.  “Police urge members of the public to remain calm and note that an appropriate police presence is in place. Police urge the media to be responsible in their reporting. Speculation can cause unnecessary alarm,” the statement added, giving no further details about the incident.  Sydney’s Opera House and several other locations in Sydney were also evacuated as a precaution. Earlier reports that Sydney’s airspace had been shut down were rejected by officials, though Qantas said its planes were being diverted around Sydney’s main business area due to the incident.  “New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking in Martin Place in Sydney,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in an emailed statement. “I have spoken with NSW Premiere Mike Baird and offered him all possible Commonwealth support and assistance.”  Abbott, who offered few details about the situation, said the cabinet’s National Security Committee had convened for briefings on the situation.  “This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,” the prime minister added. “We will provide regular updates as further information becomes available.”  The siege began as Australian Federal Police (AFP) scheduled a press conference to announce the arrest of a 25-year-old Beecroft man who has been taken into custody in connection with an alleged plot to carry out a terrorist attack on Australian soil, though it was not immediately clear whether it was linked to Monday’s crisis. The press conference was canceled as news of the siege broke.  (Copyright 2014 by BNO News B.V. All rights reserved. Info: sales@bnonews.com.)"

We'll take them to aviation experts and try to get them answered.  • Transponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data.  • Police searched Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, the city's police spokesman said in televised comments. A team of five investigators went ""through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down,"" police spokesman Markus Niesczery said.  Full story:  The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, officials said Thursday.  ""We at Lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot,"" said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings.  JUST WATCHED FBI assisting in crash investigation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH FBI assisting in crash investigation 01:51  Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot, 27-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz , apparently ""wanted to destroy the aircraft.""  It's unknown whether Lubitz planned his actions, Robin said. But he ""took advantage"" of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and ""activated the descent,"" which can only be done deliberately.  Andreas Lubitz  New details released Thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course.  Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data.  The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds. The captain, somehow locked out of the cockpit, can be heard banging on the door, Robin said.  And screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight.  For those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains, Robin said, death was instantaneous.  No clues about why co-pilot would crash plane  Police searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive.  A search is underway for the plane's second ""black box,"" the flight data recorder, which could shed more light on the plane's final minutes.  And the French government has asked the FBI to help investigate the crash, a law enforcement official said.  Investigators so far say they're baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane  Lufthansa does ""not have any clues,"" Spohr said.  The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder.  JUST WATCHED Lufthansa CEO: Speechless that co-pilot crashed plane Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lufthansa CEO: Speechless that co-pilot crashed plane 01:08  The pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight, Robin said. When the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom, he asked Lubitz to take over.  It's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned, or whether Lubitz ""put the lever on lock,"" which would have prevented the code from working, Spohr said.  The most plausible explanation of what happened next is that Lubitz, ""through deliberate abstention, refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot, and used the button"" to cause the plane to lose altitude, Robin said.  The disaster is not being described as a ""terrorist attack,"" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a ""suicide"" either, Robin said. Spohr agreed: ""If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide,"" he said.  Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known, Robin said.  Lufthansa has no standard psychological testing after hiring  He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the company said. Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen, Germany.  He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying, but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone, the prosecutor said.  He had passed medical tests, Spohr said . The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady, with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue.  Lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired, Spohr said. The company considers an applicant's psychological state when hiring, he said.  The co-pilot was ""fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own,"" Robin said.  A man in Montabaur, Germany, who belonged to the same flight club as Lubitz, said he couldn't believe it. ""The way I know Andreas, this is inconceivable,"" Peter Ruecker said.  Village opens homes to victims' loved ones  Relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished.  Seyne-les-Alpes, a nearby town, is serving as a staging post. Mayor Francis Hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area Thursday.  Most are not expected to stay overnight, he said. But in case they do, he said, local residents have offered accommodations for them.  Lufthansa is providing ""financial support"" to relatives of the victims, Spohr said. He declined to go into details.  The families of the two pilots are also in France, Robin said, but they are not in the same place as the passengers' relatives.  The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks, he said.  While some human remains have been recovered, many have not. The task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather. Workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety.  The mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access.  Victims from 18 countries  The doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday.  Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for about eight minutes.  The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of about 6,000 feet. Then it crashed.  The 144 passengers and six crew members came from 18 countries . About half were from Germany, and 35 were from Spain."

0,"One of the main questions is why the pilots did not communicate with air traffic controllers as the plane began its unusual descent, which suggested that the pilots or the plane’s automated systems may have been trying to maintain control of the aircraft as it lost altitude.  Among the theories that have been put forward by air safety analysts not involved in the investigation is the possibility that a pilot was incapacitated by a sudden event such as a fire or a drop in cabin pressure.  A senior French official involved in the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the lack of communication from the pilots during the plane’s descent was disturbing, and that the possibility that their silence was deliberate could not be ruled out.  “I don’t like it,” said the French official, who cautioned that his initial analysis was based on the very limited information currently available. “To me, it seems very weird: this very long descent at normal speed without any communications, though the weather was absolutely clear.”  Image The French aviation authorities have recovered an audio file from the cockpit voice recorder, but did not say whether it was partial or complete. Credit... Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses, via Associated Press  “So far, we don’t have any evidence that points clearly to a technical explanation,” the official said. “So we have to consider the possibility of deliberate human responsibility.”  Mr. Jouty said it was far too early in the investigation to speculate about possible causes.  “At this moment, I have no beginning of a scenario,” Mr. Jouty said. However, he said there was not yet any evidence available that would support a theory of a depressurization or of a midair explosion.  Speaking on the French radio station RTL, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday morning that terrorism was not a likely “hypothesis at the moment,” but that no theories had been excluded. He said the size of the area over which debris was scattered suggested that the aircraft had not exploded in the air but rather had disintegrated on impact.  Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, has characterized the crash as an accident. The airline has not disclosed the identities of the pilots, except to say that the captain was a 10-year veteran with more than 6,000 hours of flying time in A320s.  Image French emergency services resumed work on Wednesday near the crash site of a Germanwings jet. Credit... Peter Kneffel/European Pressphoto Agency  The French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses, which is leading the technical inquiry into the crash, sent seven investigators to the crash site Tuesday. They have been joined by their counterparts from Germany, as well as by technical advisers from Airbus and CFM International, the manufacturer of the plane’s engines.  Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Jean-Paul Troadec, a former director of the French air accident investigation bureau, said one of the big challenges for investigators would be to protect the debris at the crash site from inadvertent damage.  “We need to ensure that all the evidence is well preserved,” Mr. Troadec said, referring to the pieces of the plane littered across the steep slopes as well as to the remains of the victims. The identification of the victims will probably require matching DNA from the remains with samples from relatives.  The recovery effort will be a laborious task, given the state of the wreckage, the difficult terrain and the fact that the crash site is so remote that it can be reached only by helicopter.  Cabin depressurization, one of the possibilities speculated about on Wednesday, has occurred before, perhaps most notably in the crash of a Cypriot passenger plane in 2005 that killed all 121 people on board as it approached Athens. In that case, Helios Airways Flight 522, a slow loss of pressure rendered both pilots and all the passengers on the Boeing 737 jet unconscious for more than three-quarters of an hour before the aircraft ran out of fuel and slammed into a wooded gorge near Athens, the Greek capital.  Investigators eventually determined that the primary cause of that crash was a series of human errors, including deficient maintenance checks on the ground and a failure by the pilots to heed emergency warning signals."

It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.  And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.  ""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""  Parts of France on high alert  This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.  They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous.

Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.  Ties to Islamist extremists  As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.  Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.  Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.  Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.  Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.  His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""  ""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""  Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.  A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.  Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.  Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.  The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

0,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Terrifying letters forced a New Jersey family to flee their new home, and what happened left residents in the quiet community more than a little unnerved.  As CBS2’s Valerie Castro reported, the large six-bedroom home in Union County is being watched – according to a lawsuit filed by its new owners.  They paid $1.3 million for their “dream home” in the picturesque town of Westfield. They claim the previous owners were aware of a man who calls himself “the Watcher,” but they never said anything.  “I would be pretty upset if I bought a house and found out that the previous owners knew about it,” said Robert Hagen of Westfield.  Since moving in, the owners said they have received numerous letters from the mysterious person. “The Watcher” claimed the home “has been the subject of my family for decades,” and “I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming,” Castro reported.  The new owners have several children, and other letters asked, “Have they found out what’s in the walls yet?” and “I am pleased to know your names now, and the name of the young blood you have brought to me,” Castro reported.  The bone-chilling letters were enough to send the new family packing. The incident was so unnerving that Westfield Mayor Andy Skibitsky addressed the issue at a Town Council meeting Tuesday night.  “Our police department conducted an exhaustive investigation based on the factual circumstances and evidence available,” Skibitsky said.  No charges have been filed in the case. Whether the owners have any legal case remains to be seen, Castro reported.  The mayor said under New Jersey law, the letters are classified as a disorderly person’s crime. Anyone who might have new information about the letters is asked to call Westfield police."

0,"BERLIN -- A Swiss museum accepted a massive, priceless trove of long-hidden art from the late German collector Cornelius Gurlitt on Monday, promising to work with Germany to make sure that any Nazi-looted pieces in it are returned to Jewish heirs.  Three works in the collection donated to Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern will be returned immediately because they have already been identified as looted art, German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters said at a joint news conference with the museum. The pieces are by Henri Matisse, Max Liebermann and Carl Spitzweg.  Germany, meanwhile, published online the business ledgers of Gurlitt's father Hildebrand, an art dealer who had worked closely with the Nazi regime. Many potential heirs and art experts had demanded the move to help their searches for possible looted art. The ledgers covered the years from 1937-45, detailing in neat fountain pen the purchases and sales of various paintings.  Monday's press conference was the latest twist in a saga that has captivated the art world.  In 2012, German authorities seized 1,280 pieces of art from Cornelius Gurlitt's Munich apartment while investigating a tax case, including works by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. The development shocked the art world, since many of the works had not been seen for decades and experts feared they had been lost or destroyed.  Gurlitt said he had inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered ""degenerate"" to buyers outside of Germany for cash. Some of the works -- including Impressionist and modern masterpieces -- had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell.  Gurlitt died in May at age 81, designating Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern as his sole heir.  A special German government task force that was already looking into the provenance of the Gurlitt art will now work closely with the Kunstmuseum Bern to return any looted art as quickly as possible, Gruetters said. The agency is checking about 240 art works in the Munich trove that may have been looted by the Nazis.  ""As part of our special German responsibility toward the victims of the Nazi dictatorship, we want to ensure justice is done not only in the legal framing of the agreement, but also morally,"" Gruetters said.  In addition to art in Munich, more than 200 artworks were found at Gurlitt's house in Salzburg, Austria. Details on the Salzburg art have been scarce -- it's not even clear where the art is now stored. Gruetters said it will be checked to see if it, too, contains Nazi-looted art.  One of Gurlitt's cousins has filed a claim on the collection, which a Munich court said would have to be sorted out before the art goes anywhere. The court has given no indication of how long that could take.  Kunstmuseum Bern's board president, Christoph Schaeublin, told reporters the decision to accept the collection came only after long, difficult deliberations to figure out how the museum could carry out the responsibilities that came with the bequest.  Julius Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish scholar who believes art stolen from his family may be among the Gurlitt collection, told The Associated Press he welcomed Germany's move to put Hildebrand Gurlitt's account books online. But Schoeps said the new agreement seems to make it even more complicated for possible heirs to retrieve their property.  ""They didn't say a word about who we can turn to for help,"" said Schoeps. ""More and more institutions are getting involved in this -- the German government task force, the Bern museum, the Lost Art Database in Magdeburg -- I find this very irritating.""  Greg Schneider, executive vice-president of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said so far the work of the German task force on looted art has been too opaque. He urged that the agency make both its deliberations and its findings public.  ""The major aspects of the agreement are quite positive, the key will be the implementation,"" Schneider said in a telephone interview from New York. ""This promises lifting the veil of secrecy, so we'll have to see."""
0,"A t least twelve people were killed when Islamist gunmen carried out a “massacre” inside the Paris offices of a satirical magazine today.  Hooded attackers armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles stormed the offices of the notoriously anti-Islamic weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo this morning.

Ten people in total were reported to be wounded, including five critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police who attended the scene.  Emergency workers administer treatment to victims at the scene  Eye witnesses reported seeing hooded men dressed in black entering the newspaper’s headquarters before firing Kalashnikovs.  One employee contacted by phone as the attack was going on said : “It’s a massacre. There are dead! “ before the call was disconnected.  French TV channel Europe 1 reported witnesses saying the black hooded men, who carried out the attack shouted out “Allah Akbar” and “The Prophet has been avenged”.  There were reports that two police officers were among the dead.

My thoughts are with the victims, their families and their colleagues. — Nick Clegg (@nick_clegg) January 7, 2015  The offices were firebombed in 2011 after publishing an image of Mohammed and today’s attack came after it publicised a controversial novel entitled Submission by French author Michel Houellebecq which talks of France turning into an Islamic state by 2022.  The magazine featured the author and a reference to Ramadan on its front page published yesterday.  The atrocity is the latest in a series of Islamist linked attacks in France.  Police and ambulances at the scene of the attack  President Hollande was on the scene today, saying the worst terrorist atrocity in recent years this century was an unjustifiable attack on press freedom.  He called the shooting a “cowardly assassination” and a “barbaric act against journalists who wanted to defend their ideas”  He added: “I will convene emergency cabinet meeting today to protect all areas where similar acts can be committed.”  First pics of Charlie Hebdo massacre gumen shooting at police - they got away, heading towards eastern Paris. pic.twitter.com/z2dM3ZUR7k — Peter Allen (@peterallenparis) January 7, 2015  He said it was “no doubt this is a terrorist attack”, adding: “We must show national unity and strength.  “France is moved by this attack because we are a freedom-loving nation.”  Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the attack saying: “The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.”  An injured man is taken away from the scene on a stretcher  The offices of the same magazine were burnt down in a petrol attack in 2011 after running a magazine cover of the Prophet Mohammed as a cartoon character.  At the time, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephane Charbonnier, said Islam could not be excluded from freedom of the press.  He said: ‘If we can poke fun at everything in France, if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism, that is annoying.’  France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve (C, L) and Paris' Mayor Anne Hidalgo (C, R) arrive at the headquarters in the wake of the shooting  Mr Charbonnier, also known as Charb, said he did not see the attack on the magazine as the work of French Muslims, but of what he called ‘idiot extremists’  The cover showed Mohammad saying: “100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter”.  A crashed police car after a gunfight broke out near the magazine HQ  Inside, there was an editorial, attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, and more cartoons - one showing the Prophet with a clown’s red nose.  Depiction of the Prophet is strictly prohibited in Islam, but the magazine denied it was trying to be provocative.  Benoit Bringer, a journalist with Agence Premiere Ligne - who saw the attack, told the iTele network he saw several masked men armed with machine guns.  He said two officers arrived on bicycles, then - apparently unarmed - they left."
0,"to have been onboard  Advertisement  A number of British nationals are likely to be among the 150 people killed when Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and ploughed into a remote region of the French Alps, the Foreign Secretary said tonight.  The announcement from Philip Hammond came just hours after the first pictures emerged of those who died when the Airbus A320 crashed during the 90-minute flight from Spain to Germany.  Among the dead were 16 German schoolchildren, six crew and an opera singer who was travelling with her baby. Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio, a 37-year-old Spanish woman living in Manchester, and her seven-month-old son, Julian, also died.  Two Australian nationals, a mother and son, are among the confirmed victims. There were early reports that an American passenger was on board but this has not been confirmed.  Scroll down for videos  Victims: Opera singers Maria Radner (left), who was travelling with her baby, and Oleg Bryjak (right) were among the passengers who lost their lives in the crash. It is also likely that a number of British nationals were among those who died, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said  Australian victims: Mother and son Carol and Greig Friday, from Victoria, were among the 150 passengers and crew on board doomed Germanwings Flight 4U 9525  Crash site: Pieces of debris, including what appear to be parts of the aircraft's tail fin and a wheel, are seen strewn on the mountainside  Wreckage: The registration of the aircraft, which features a German flag, was one of the larger pieces of debris photographed at the crash site  President Barack Obama expressed his condolences over the 'awful' crash which he called 'particularly heartbreaking' as so many of the plane's passengers were young.  A further two Japanese citizens were also believed to have been on board the doomed plane, Tokyo said.  German reports suggest the aircraft had been grounded just 24 hours before it departed Barcelona for Dusseldorf. The plane had suffered technical issues, including a landing gear problem.  The revelation will put pressure on owner Germanwings to explain why the plane was allowed to fly. Urgent safety checks are now being carried out on other A320s, which are popular with budget airlines.  Meanwhile, passengers were left stranded at Heathrow, Stansted and Manchester after several Germanwings crews - including pilots - refused to work following the accident yesterday over safety fears.  Experts said Flight 4U 9525's rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky – prompting speculation that the pilots may have suddenly fallen unconscious. As the French authorities appeared to rule out terrorism, it also emerged that:  Five years ago two pilots from the same Germanwings airline nearly passed on landing in Cologne. Contaminated air was suspected;  It is the third serious incident involving the Airbus 'family' in six months – two of them fatal crashes that have left more than 300 dead;  A safety warning was issued last November after a sister plane of Flight 4U 9525 went into a dive over Spain, falling at 4,000ft a minute before the pilot regained control.  Disaster: A rescue helicopter flies over wreckage of a Germanwings Airbus A320 plane that crashed between the towns of Barcelonnette and Digne in the French Alps. All 150 people on board - including two babies and 16 children from the same German school - died in the crash  Destruction: The distinctive colours of the Germanwings plane are seen in this close-up photo of the destroyed rudder of the aircraft  Obliterated: Debris reportedly from the Airbus A320 is seen on the mountainside. Mystery surrounds the final moments of the plassenger plane after air traffic controllers claimed they received no SOS signal despite the jet nosediving 32,000ft in just eight minutes  Destroyed: Crews in the first helicopter to reach the site said they had seen no survivors and reported finding chunks of plane the size of a car  About 150 firefighters and mountain police were deployed to the scene, although officials warn it could take days to retrieve any bodies  Windows from the Airbus A320, a model of plane known as the 'workhorse of the skies', are clearly visible on this piece of debris  Photographs taken of the scene this evening show what appears to be sections of charred aircraft on the mountainside  All 142 passengers, two babies and six crew died on the morning flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, in Germany's Ruhr region.  The German pupils, from the small town of Haltern, were with two teachers. Others who were on board the flight included a 37-year-old Spanish woman who lives in Manchester – whose child also died – and the Spanish opera star Maria Radner, who was with her child.  Mother and son Carol and Greig Friday from Victoria were confirmed as the two Australian victims of the French Alps plane disaster.  The family of the pair released a statement on Wednesday, which said: 'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams.'  Last night one of the black box flight recorders that could hold the key to what happened had been recovered as more than 500 members of search and rescue teams worked to reach the remote site of the disaster above the small village of Barcelonette in the Massif des Trois Evêchés.  Pictures of the crash site showed debris - with no pieces larger than a small car - and wreckage scattered on the bare, bleak mountainside over an area said to be more than a mile square.  Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister, described the site as a 'picture of horror' while Christophe Castaner, deputy of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region where the jet crashed, tweeted: 'Horrible images in this mountain landscape. There is nothing left, but debris and bodies.'  Such was the disintegration of the 24-year-old jet yesterday that little appeared recognisable apart from a section containing several windows.  Images of the crash site emerged yesterday as confusion reigned over the final minutes of the doomed Airbus A320 after air traffic controllers claimed they received no SOS despite the jet nosediving 32,000ft in just eight minutes.  Part of the writing on the fuselage of the plane is visible on a piece of the wreckage (centre) on the mountainside  Four members of the search team are seen making their way to the crash site. The operation has now been called off for the night  Views of the crash site show a handful of rescue workers starting their work among pieces of debris scattered across the mountainside  Charred pieces of wreckage continue to burn on the mountainside alongside smaller pieces of debris  Parts of the plane, none larger than a small car, are pictured on the side of the mountain where the Airbus A320 crashed yesterday  Earlier reports quoted aviation sources in France as saying the pilots issued a Mayday distress signal and requested an emergency descent minutes before it hit the ground. However, civil aviation authorities later denied that air traffic controllers received any such call.  'The aircraft did not itself make a distress call, but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,' a spokesman for the French civil aviation authority said.  One local spoke of hearing an explosion 'like dynamite' while another said he had seen the plane flying far too low. Sebastien Giroux said: 'There was no smoke or particular sound or sign of anything wrong, but at the altitude it was flying it was clearly not going to make it over the mountains.  'I didn't see anything wrong with the plane, but it was too low. I didn't see much, perhaps for two or three seconds … it seemed it was going down.'  Gilbert Sauvan, a local council spokesman, said the plane disintegrated on impact, leaving the 'largest piece of wreckage the size of a car.'  The weather was calm at the time of the accident with the sky completely clear, with almost no wind.  Bookshop owner Dominique Casson, 38, said: 'I heard a loud bang and then saw just smoke and flames at the top of the hillside.  'The plane came down so quickly there was no notice at all. There could have been even more loss of life if it came down in a more populated area.'  Bruce Robin, a prosecutor from Marseille, said: 'The body of the plane is in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage.'  Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said the aircraft began descending again shortly after it reached its cruising height of 38,000ft, having taken off from Barcelona at about 10am local time.  It started losing altitude at around 10.33am with the speed reportedly increasing to 548mph. The last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending to 6,800 feet at 434mph – eight minutes later – at 10.41am.  Scattered: Images from the first rescue helicopters to reach the remote crash site shows wreckage spread across hundreds of metres  Vast wilderness: An aerial view of the area in the French Alps where the Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed, between Barcelonette and Digne  A rescue helicopter flies over pieces of debris. The search operation has been called off for tonight as is expected to resume tomorrow  Mr Winkelmann said the captain was experienced and had been with the Germanwings' parent company Lufthansa for more than ten years, having clocked up 6,000 flying hours.  The plane, he said, had had a normal service at Dusseldorf on Monday and its last major check-up had been in the summer of 2013. It flew regularly to London and was there last Sunday.  Passengers reported seeing several Germanwings planes still stuck on the tarmac at Dusseldorf yesterday hours after they should have departed.  Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Tuesday evening that he understood the crew members' sentiments.  'One must not forget: many of our Germanwings crews have known crew members who were onboard the crashed plane,' Spohr said.  'It is now more important to ensure psychological assistance if needed. And we will get back to a full flight operation as soon as possible then. But for me, this is rather secondary now,' he added. Yesterday, Heike Birlenbach, the airline's vice president told reporters: 'we say it is an accident'.  Aviation expert Chris Yates told MailOnline it was difficult to explain why the pilots would not send an emergency call.  'Air crash investigators will need to examine the black boxes, the flight data recorder and the voice recorder to determine exactly what happened,' he said. 'It is possible that the pilots sent a distress signal that was not received by air traffic control.'  Around 100 of the dead are German. Two Australians, and one person each from the Netherlands, Turkey, and Denmark were among the victims, according to their respective governments. Another 45 victims are Spanish and relatives were bussed to hotels near Barcelona's El Prat airport.  The Mexican government said there were indications that one Mexican national was also among the victims.  Two leading opera singers, German-born Maria Radner and Oleg Bryjak from Kazakhstan, were among those who lost their lives in the crash.  Ms Radner, who performed all over the world including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and theatres in Milan and Buenos Aires, was on the plane with her husband and baby. She had just finished performing alongside Mr Bryjak in the Richard Wagner opera Siegfried at Barcelona's Liceu.

We are stunned.' He added that the theatre's employees will hold two minutes of silence on Wednesday in the singers' honor.  Spanish national Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio, from the city of Jaca in Huesca, and her seven-month-old baby were also named as passengers. Local media reported the 37-year-old lived in Manchester but had returned to Spain for her uncle's funeral. It is not known whether her husband was with her.  Sources close to the Spaniard said she had decided to return via Germany after being unable to get a direct flight.  Two Australians were among those who died. They were a Victorian mother and her adult son, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. Officials are now seeking to confirm whether there were any other Australians or dual citizens on board.  A schoolgirl, her mother and grandmother, and an unnamed father of four, are also understood to have died in the crash.  The Foreign Office has set up a helpline for anyone concerned about a friend or family member who may have been on board.  In a statement released tonight, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the crash as a 'tragic incident' and sent his condolences to those who have lost family or friends.  He said: 'I don't want to speculate on numbers of British nationals involved until we have completed our checks on all the passenger information.  'However, based on the information available to us, it is sadly likely that there were some British nationals on board the flight. We are providing consular assistance and will give further help as more information becomes available.'  French emergency services workers and members of the French gendarmerie gather in Seyne, south-eastern France near the site where a Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed in the French Alps  French firefighters prepare to take-off from Digne-les-Bains for the site where the Airbus A320 crashed  He added Britain was working closely with the French, German and Spanish authorities, and the airline to establish the facts surrounding the crash.  President Barack Obama expressed his condolences and said America stood by their allies in this 'moment of sorrow.'  'Our thoughts and prayers are with our friends in Europe, especially the people of Germany and Spain,' he said ahead of a joint press conference with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan at the White House.  'I called German Chancellor (Angela) Merkel and I hope to speak with President Rajoy of Spain later today to express condolences of the American people, and to offer whatever assistance that we can as they investigate the awful tragedy.  'It's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children.'  The search of the plane crash site was called off for the night after conditions became too difficult and will resume tomorrow morning, French authorities said. Ten French police officers will guard the site overnight.  It is France's first air crash since Concorde crashed minutes after take-off from Charles de Gaulle airport in 2000, killing 113 people.  Yesterday, debris from the jet was found scattered over a wide area near Barcelonnette in an inhospitable region of the Alps.  One witness, a local farmer named only as Jean-Christophe led rescuers to the scene. He told French radio: 'The plane smacked straight into the wall of the mountain and just blew up completely.  'I saw smoke, bits of plane, none very big. Everything has exploded and sprayed over the scene. There is really nothing left. Given the impact I cannot imagine the bodies are whole.'  French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve (centre) is sheltered from the rain upon his arrival in Seyne, close to the crash site  'It is possible that the pilots sent a distress signal that was not received by Air Traffic Control. A thorough examination of the recorders will help provide a precise sequence of events.'  Grieving families, including those of the 16 schoolchildren killed in the crash, gathered at Dusseldorf airport in Germany yesterday, where the jet was due to land, to await news of the rescue and recovery operation.  French president Francois Hollande said he did not expect there to be any survivors.  He said: 'It's a loss, a tragedy which has happened on our soil. I am seeking information about homes in the area it came down. It's difficult place to access. In the meantime solidarity must prevail.' He said he believes most of the passengers were German, Spanish and Turkish.  Speaking last night, President Obama said his thoughts were with the families of those killed in the crash. He added that he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and planned to call Spanish President Mariano Rajoy later in the day.  The White House and the airline chief said there was no sign that terrorism was involved, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged reporters not to speculate on the cause.  Shock: A man who appears to have been waiting for missing Flight 4U 9525 reacts at Dusseldorf airport where the Airbus A320 was due to land  Grief: People waiting for Flight 4U 9525 are led away by staff at the airport in Dusseldorf  People waiting for flight 4U 9525 console each other as news of the crash filters through at Dusseldorf airport  Relatives of the plane crash passengers are seen leaving Terminal 2 of Barcelona El Prat airport, where the plane took off yesterday  'We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash,' she said in Berlin. 'All that will be investigated thoroughly.' Mrs Merkel, Mr Hollande and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy were to visit the site on Wednesday.  According to flight data from FlightAware 24, the aircraft was cruising at 38,000 feet at 532mph at 9.30am local time (10.30am GMT). It started losing altitude to 37,975 by 10.31am with the speed reportedly increasing to 548mph.  But 10.41am, the last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending to 6,800 feet at 434mph. The aircraft took around ten minutes to drop 31,200 feet.  The cause of the crash was not immediately known, with weather conditions described as good in the region and the airliner flying at an altitude high above the Alps.  The area is inaccessible for vehicles but helicopters are able to deposit vehicles at the site.  About 150 firefighters and high mountain police were deployed to the scene, including 40 officers from Grimp – a unit within the Fire Service that specializes in rescue operations in dangerous and inhospitable environments.  Fifty vehicles, including 4x4s, quads and ambulances, are also being deployed. Dog teams will also investigate at the scene.  AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION: WHAT HAPPENED TO FLIGHT 4U9525? RAPID DECOMPRESSION? Flight 4U9525 was at 38,000 for three minutes before it began its descent. If the cabin lost pressure the flight crew is trained to immediately don their emergency masks before doing anything else. Once secured, the pilots begin an emergency descent to bring the aircraft under 14,000 feet. SLOW DECOMPRESSION? If the aircraft failed to pressurise properly, the pilots could have been suffering from a lack of oxygen. Pilots are trained to recognise the signs of hypoxia and act accordingly. However, with Helios Flight 522, the pilots failed to act in time and are believed to have died of oxygen deprivation before the jet eventually ran out of fuel. TERRORISM? Experts have almost ruled out a terrorist bomb as an explosion at high altitude would spread debris over a large area such as the Lockerbie disaster. Initial searches of the scene suggest the debris field is very localised. MECHANICAL / COMPUTER FAILURE? Air crash investigators will search for the black boxes containing the flight data recorder which measures information about the speed, altitude and the aircraft's various computer settings. The European Air Safety Agency recently issued a safety directive for all Airbus A318-A321s after a Lufthansa jet went into an uncontrolled dive in November 2014. They will also look for the cockpit voice recorder. This is a crucial piece of evidence as it will tell investigators what was happening in the run up to the disaster and what efforts they made, if any, to save the jet. PILOT ERROR? The black boxes will help determine if the pilots were at fault for what happened. Did they deal with the emergency in the appropriate fashion. MILITARY INCIDENT? Some experts claim that an Italian military jet switched its transponder to the emergency code of #7700 at 10.35, near where flight 4U9525 began its final descent. Investigators should be quickly able to determine whether this emergency was a coincidence or possibly had some relevance to the passenger jet's demise.

The students - all of whom are understood to be in their teens - were pupils at the English-speaking Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Haltern-am-See, not far from the city of Dusseldorf. The Year 10 pupils were returning home from a week-long exchange programme in Barcelona at the time of the disaster, which took place in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany. This afternoon it emerged that the pupils almost missed the doomed flight when one of the students left her passport behind. But in a tragic twist her host family offered to race the girl and all her travel documents to the airport directly, allowing them to make the flight in time. As darkness fell in over Haltern am See, mourners gathered outside Joseph-Koenig school to pay tribute to the victims of the crash Mourners gathered at a memorial of flowers and candles outside the college where the teenagers, all in year 10, were pupils Tragic: In emotional scenes in Haltern-am-See this afternoon, schoolmates of those killed in the disaster were seen comforting one another and embracing and they laid flowers at the school gates School children mourn for their dead school mates in front of the Joseph-Koenig Gymnasium this afternoon Grief: Pupils mourn in front of the Joseph-Koenig college in Haltern am See this afternoon In emotional scenes in Haltern-am-See this afternoon, schoolmates of those killed in the disaster were seen comforting one another and embracing and they laid flowers at the school gates. One note, written in memory of a girl called Kati, read: 'Gone, but not forgotten, lost but always with us. Our hearts are broken but you are forever in them'. One school, pupil called Ibrahim told local TV; 'I lost a good friend on that plane, 15 years old, a beautiful girl with everything ahead of her. We are in bits here. We cannot take it in.' In a press conference this afternoon the school confirmed that all the students boarded the plane together, adding: 'This is without doubt the bleakest day in the history of our town.' At a press conference this afternoon, mayor of Haltern am See, Bodo Klimpel, said employees had spoken with officials in Barcelona who confirmed that all 16 students and two teachers had boarded the plane together. 'The 16 students affected were from a Spanish course in Year 10. They took part in a student exchange in Spain and were flying back this afternoon,' he said, adding that a coach had been waiting at Dusseldorf airport to pick the students up.

Earlier there were rumours that several of the students had missed the flight after one of them forgot her passport but hopes were subsequently dashed by Marti Pujol - the mayor of the village of Llinars del Valles where the children had been staying. The mayor revealed that the young girl had realised she left her passport behind after arriving at the train station with the rest of her companions to catch a train to Barcelona's El Prat airport Children at the Giola Secondary School, where the exchange students were on exchange, spoke of their sorrow after hearing the news. One, Anna Garcia, said: 'One of the German girls left a bag with all her travel documents inside at her host family's home... So they didn't hold the rest of the group up, the family took her to the airport and she was able to board the plane.' The director of Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium in Germany said that once it became clear that the plane was not going to land at Dusseldorf, lessons at the school were immediately cancelled. By this afternoon friends and relatives of the dead had taken to social media sites to express their sadness at their deaths. Students attend a mass in Llinars del Valles, the Spanish town near Barcelona where the German exchange pupils attended school Advertisement  It emerged yesterday that a safety warning was issued last year when a sister plane of the one involved in yesterday's disaster suddenly lost altitude.  The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after an Airbus A321 went into an uncontrollable dive north of Pamplona, Spain before pulling out.  According to the safety warning, the Lufthansa jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at 31,000 feet when it started to descend without any input from the pilot, at a rate of 4,000 feet per minute, before the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000 feet.  According to the EASA, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.  The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in yesterday's disaster.  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last night confirmed that all 150 people on board the aircraft were dead. Alain Vidal, Secretary of State for Transport, Sea and Fisheries, was more final, insisting there were no survivors.  Spanish vice-president Soraya Saez de Sanataria said 45 people with Spanish surnames were travelling on the Airbus A320.  Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said in a hastily-arranged press conference he was cancelling his diary and heading back to Madrid to head a crisis cabinet. He described the accident as a 'dramatic and sad' piece of news but declined to talk about the victims.  He said: 'I profoundly regret this very sad accident. We are going to do all we can.'  He also confirmed he had spoken with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish King Felipe VI.  The monarch announced yesterday shortly after arriving in France for a three-day official visit that he was cancelling the trip.  German media reports say there is a wide field of debris visible.  Pierre Polizzi, the owner of a nearby camping site told Al Jazeera: 'The plane crashed just 2km from here, high on a mountain.  'There was loud noise and then suddenly nothing. At first I thought it came from fighter jets that often hold drills in the area.'  Lucille Polizzi, 18, said: 'We were outside and then suddenly we heard this big noise.  'I thought it was an earthquake. We have earthquakes fairly frequently here, just small ones. I wasn't afraid. My father thought it was a fighter jet but we couldn't see any.  'The noise lasted probably seven or eight seconds. Then it stopped. There was nothing for maybe 15 to 30 seconds. Then a second noise.  'The same as the first noise and it lasted about the same time. I wondered then if it was perhaps an avalanche.'  AIRBUS A320: THE WORKHORSE OF THE SKIES The Airbus A320 - the model of aircraft involved in yesterday's accident - is known as 'the workhorse of the skies' and is used by British Airways and a number of popular budget airlines. Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds. The short-haul, narrow-body airliner is assembled in France, Germany and China and was ranked as the world's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low-cost airlines. This Germanwings Airbus A320 carrying 144 passengers and six crew has crashed in the French Alps And the single-aisle aircraft, which typically seats around 150 passengers, 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes', according to Airbus. Despite the Airbus A320 having one of the best safety records in the world, the widely-used family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used, resulting in scores of deaths. One the first accidents to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of France, not far from the current crash site, when an Air Inter flight came down in the Vosges mountains in 1992. The single-aisle aircraft, which typically seats around 150 passengers, 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes', according to Airbus. Above, file photo of inside an A320 aircraft The Airbus A320-111 was on its approach to Strasbourg airport when it hit La Bloss Mountain, killing 87 of the 96 people on board. The best-known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the US had to put down in the Hudson River in New York. The US Airways flight from the city's LaGuardia Airport heading for Charlotte, North Carolina when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese. One of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in May 2006, when Armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near Sochi, Russia.

The three-day state visit of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain has been suspended following the crash of an Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline  One eyewitness in the village of Le Vernet, where some wreckage has been sighted, told Le Parisien newspaper: 'This morning I heard a massive thud and soon after saw several jets fly over.  'The initial sound was like an avalanche or like the sound of the dynamite they use to cause an avalanche.  FIRST FATAL CRASH IN HISTORY OF GERMANWINGS AIRLINE Germanwings is the low-cost subsidiary of German national carrier Lufthansa, and was first branded in 2002. The company's history can be dated back to 1997, however, when it was known as Eurowings. Lufthansa have announced that Cologne-based Germanwings will be going back to its roots and re-branding back to Eurowings in autumn this year. There are a total of 81 aircraft in Germanwings' fleet, with an average of 9.2 years, flying to 86 destinations around the world. The fleet includes the Airbus A319, Airbus A320 and the Bombardier CRJ900. There had never been a fatal crash in Germanwings' history until the reports of yesterday's tragedy. Back in December 2010, a Germanwings flight was said to be 'moments from crashing' after the pilots were overcome with fumes on landing at Cologne. The plane had 150 passengers on board, and officials accused Germanwings of 'playing down the incident' to 'avoid investigation'. Advertisement  'Then around noon I looked out of the window and saw a column of smoke rising into the air. We're around 3km away, but also in the mountains and snow bound.'  One resident, called Rejane, told BBC News: 'We heard a strange noise. It was a deep noise, not very nice, I thought at first it was a small earthquake.'  Another witness, on the other side of the mountain in Pra Loup, Hervé Graf, of Chalet Hotel Les Blancs, told Mail Online: ' We are probably one of the nearest habitations but saw and heard nothing even though it apparently crashed into the other side of the mountain from us.  'It is not a skiable area and there is deep, deep snow. At this time of the year anyway there are very few tourists or skiers here.'  One man who was due to be on the flight told BBC News he had 'mixed emotions' at changing his travel plans. David Cabanes, who flew on Monday instead, said his flight had been filled with tourists and families.  German airline Lufthansa said it has no information yet about the crash of a jet belonging to its Germanwings subsidiary, describing it as a 'dark day'.  'We do not yet know what has happened to flight 4U 9525,' Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said via Twitter.  'My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors.'  Shares in Lufthansa and Airbus were down 4.7 percent and 2.1 per cent respectively after news of the accident.  Lufthansa was also hit by a four-day pilots' strike last week, although this did not affect Germanwings.  The European Aviation Safety Agency said: 'It is very sad news that the Germanwings flight 4U-9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf crashed in the south of France. All our thoughts are with the families of the victims.  'We are closely monitoring the latest information and we are in contact with the French authorities, Airbus and other organisations involved, in order to provide any support possible.'  Airbus, who manufactured the jet in November 1990, added: 'We have been informed of an accident involving an A320 Family aircraft and all efforts are now going towards assessing the situation.  'We will provide further information as soon as available. Our thoughts are with those affected by this tragic event.'  The crashed A320 is 24 years old and has been with the parent Lufthansa group since 1991, according to online database airfleets.net.  But Captain Peter Benn, speaking from Whiteley in Hampshire, told Channel 4 News: 'When you state the age of the aircraft, it's important to emphasise that these planes are maintained to near perfect condition as can be.  'This is one of the most, if not the most, checked transport in the history of human mobility. The aircraft will have been safely looked after.'  The arrivals board shows flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona without a status at the airport in Dusseldorf  Revealed: Germanwings flight 4U9525 received safety warning just four months ago after sister plane went into tailspin  Sister plane of that involved in yesterday's crash lost altitude late last year  Air safety agency sent out directive warning operators to be aware  Pilot in that incident pulled the plane out of the dive averting problems  Airbus A320s involved in number of accidents since introduced in 1980s  Plane is considered extremely safe and is widely used around world  A safety warning was issued last year when a sister plane of that involved in yesterday's accident suddenly lost altitude.  The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after an Airbus A321 went into an uncontrollable dive north of Pamplona, Spain before recovering.  According to the safety warning, the Lufthansa jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at 31,000 feet when it started to descend without any input from the pilot, at a rate of 4,000 feet per minute, before the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000 feet.  According to the EASA, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.  The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in yesterday's disaster.  In response, Airbus created a 'temporary revision' to all of the aircraft's flight manuals.  The A321 involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in yesterday's crash, carrying an extra 40 passengers.  A similar Airbus plane to that involved in yesterday's crash was put down in the Hudson River, New York in 2009  Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds.

In an Atlanta suburb this past weekend, Melissa Alford (a black woman) and her family were hosting an outdoor birthday party in Douglasville, Georgia, when a convoy of seven large pickup trucks donning Confederate flags interrupted the party and pulled into the grass. The occupants then called them niggers and threatened them with violence, according to multiple eyewitnesses, who also stated that the men actually flashed guns at them:    One of at least two cellphone videos from the incident shows Douglasville police officers holding back a group of black men and women as at least seven pickup trucks drive off. The trucks’ white passengers wave as the Confederate, American and military flags mounted on the vehicles flap in the air. . “This is a child’s birthday party,” one woman in the crowd can be heard saying.

A woman who shared the video said the trucks were on her property and their passengers were armed and threatened to “kill y’all [N-words].”  Video can be viewed below."

This means above all that works contained in the estate which turn out to be looted art or which must with high likelihood be viewed as looted art will be restituted to the rightful owners under these principles.” // “Looted art and art which is suspected to be looted art will not be touched by the Bern Art Museum. It will not even make it onto Swiss territory.” // “The decision, ladies and gentlemen, was far from easy for the board of trustees. There were certainly no feelings of triumph. They would be absolutely inappropriate in light of the art collection’s history.” // Overall, it represents an asset for the Bern Art Museum, without a doubt.

0,"FACT CHECK: Was Shawn Fuller, a man suspected of murdering his two toddler sons, a gun enthusiast?  Claim: Shawn Fuller, a man suspected of murdering his two toddler sons, was an “open carry enthusiast.”  TRUE  Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2015]  Origins: In the early morning hours of 9 August 2015, police officers in Iredell County, North Carolina, responded to a call about an incident at the home of Shawn Fuller. Fuller’s brother, not named in media reports, called police at approximately 3:30 AM, stating that Fuller was “intoxicated and firing a weapon”:  A North Carolina man was drunk when he shot and killed his two sons, 3 and 4, and then tried to commit suicide early Sunday, police said. Sheriff Darren Campbell [said] that when deputies arrived at the Statesville home, Fuller was outside the front door suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Fuller was taken to Carolina Medical Center in Charlotte in critical condition. Deputies found the young brothers after going into the home, where they lived with their mom and dad.  Police confirmed that 4-year-old Uriah Fuller and 3-year-old Josiah Fuller were shot multiple times and died on the scene. Shawn Fuller, 31, was transported to a local hospital after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He died a few weeks later.  In that respect, the captions on the image displayed above are largely accurate: both Fuller boys died of gunshot wounds, and their father was the primary (and only) suspect in their shooting.  Separate claims made in the photograph pertained to Fuller’s enthusiasm for firearms and purported advocacy of the open carry of guns. His Facebook page has since been removed from the social network, but several other web sites have carried claims about the type of content it hosted before it was made unavailable.  On 9 August 2015, Charlotte television station WSOC spoke with a local woman who had interacted with Fuller earlier on the day of the shootings. The woman, Kelli Simko, recounted a conversation with Fuller about guns and his belief in the necessity of carrying them in public; and said she later located Fuller on Facebook after reading about the shooting and was troubled by the purportedly violent tenor of his postings:  But for Kelli Simko, 37, who was also in the store at the time, something seemed off. “He had a gun on his belt,” Simko said of her interaction with Fuller earlier in the day. “He told (the clerk) he wouldn’t shop anywhere he couldn’t bring his gun.” In addition to several comments about carrying his gun openly, Fuller talked about how he enrolled his boys in self-defense classes because of how the world is today. “He said how you can’t even walk into a movie theater anymore,” she said. She searched online and found Fuller’s Facebook profile, which included photos of guns and Confederate flags. “It was him… and it was those two little boys… and I can’t stop crying.”  A neighbor of Fuller’s (who declined to be identified) described him to the Charlotte Observer as an avid shooter who was “scared of everything”:  A neighbor who has lived across the street since 1976 also complained about the shooting. She declined to give her name. “There were a lot of cars in and out all the time,” the woman said. “You would think at times there was a firing range down there.” On the occasions when they had talked, Fuller often seemed paranoid and behaved as if he was “scared of everything,” Patterson said. Fuller also worried that someone was trying to break into his home, Patterson said. On Saturday, Patterson drove into his driveway around 12:30 p.m., and Fuller was in the backyard, shooting. He said the shooting continued all day Saturday and into the night.  Purported screenshots from Fuller’s now-deleted Facebook page, containing gun enthusiast memes, have circulated online. Those screen captures cannot be verified, however, as Fuller’s Facebook page is not available.  In January 2016, the meme about Fuller began re-circulating on social media, still claiming (inaccurately) that he had shot his children “this weekend.” However, the events took place in August 2015."
0,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.  The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.  Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.  It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.  CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.  He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.  In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.  ""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.  ""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the suspected gunman in Wednesday's Ottawa shootings, had a criminal record in B.C. and Quebec. (Twitter)  Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.  Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.  Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.  Caught 'by surprise'  In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""  ""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.  Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.  Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.  Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.  Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.  Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.  In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:  NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""  Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""

1,"Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom – News 8 Louisiana – Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua Johnson shoving sausages under her shirt. CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.  The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will “haunt his dreams forever.” The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said that when he entered “She didn’t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.”  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Shocked, and also frightened for his safety due to the fact that Johnson is a “big girl,” the 140 pound security guard said he ran out until police arrived. When they did, female officers entered the restroom with Johnson still “putting in work with the sausage.” All in all, it took 7 police officers to restrain Johnson and pry the victimized sausage out of the woman’s hands. She was arrested and taken into custody where she was charged with shoplifting, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. Walmart management said in no way do they tolerate this type of behavior. They have a strict policy against shoplifters and a sign on the bathroom door that clearly reads, “No merchandise allowed beyond this point.”"
1,"Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.  “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”  Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.  “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”  “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded."

1,"On 22 November 2015, the Facebook page New Yorkers posted a photograph purportedly showing a 41-lb rat caught in New York City:    41 pound rat recently caught in NYC… (via Chris Brannigan)  Although image was widely shared by various online outlets, no one provided any substantive information about the allegedly enormous rodent.  If the pictured rat were truly was “caught” in New York City, it would most likely have been a brown rat (also known as a Norway or Norwegian rat). The city is home to approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these rodents only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs. in weight.  As many commenters pointed out on in responding to the original Facebook post, the pictured animal doesn’t look like it was “caught” at all. The rat appears to be groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone’s pet. If that’s the case, this animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these rodents are a fair bit larger than the brown rat, they don’t typically grow any bigger than four pounds.  So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It’s likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (whose hands cannot be seen) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. This technique creates the illusion that what is likely just an average-sized rat appears to be much larger in the photograph.  For comparison’s sake, here’s a photograph of a 3-foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012:"
1,"Hundreds of Prince fans who lined up for hours outside Massey Hall had their hopes dashed Tuesday afternoon when promoter Live Nation confirmed on Twitter that there would be no concert that night after all.  Fans of the pop legend reported being turned away without tickets or wristbands — and no word on whether a surprise show would be scheduled for Wednesday.  “When we were told very abruptly after seven hours of waiting that ‘Prince would not be playing Massey Hall this evening’ and they were ‘taking the barricades down,’ it was quite shocking that there was no more information given,” said Rebecca Webster, a local music publicist who was near the front of the line on Tuesday.  “I don’t know who is at fault for that. When I left, there were a lot of people determined that there was a show that evening.”  Indeed, there were still some diehards lined up outside Massey Hall at 7:30 p.m. in the rain, a testament to the dedication of Prince’s fans.  In a Facebook post Tuesday night, promoter Live Nation apologized for “any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today.”  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal,” the post said. “There was no concert scheduled for today.”  A statement from 3rdeyegirl, Prince’s collaborating band, on Tuesday evening added: “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances . . .  “We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  But it was 3rdeyegirl that helped cause the commotion to begin with. Social media had picked up on the rumour early Tuesday morning after the band issued a cryptic tweet with Toronto spelled backwards: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING. . . ”  The tweet was quickly deleted around 8:30 a.m., but not before it spread like wildfire online.  Many posted on social media that tickets to the show would reportedly cost $10 and only the first 200 people in line would be let in. Others said there could be a pair of shows performed by Prince: one Tuesday night and another Wednesday.  Scott Morin, a 40-year-old jazz record label manager and lifelong Prince fan, said he was tipped off about the show when his Google Alerts awoke him Monday night to inform him of the 3rdeyegirl tweet.  He said he quickly mobilized a handful of friends, also Prince aficionados, and made it to the front of the Massey Hall lineup by 7:45 a.m.  “I figured there would be quite a lineup, but there were only a few people, so we lucked out,” he said while motioning to the hundreds and counting who had lined up behind him in the hours after.  Rebecca Webster had made it to Massey Hall at 8 a.m. to find herself fourth in line. She and her friends figured the rumours were plausible.  “The venue (Massey Hall) was available, the artist was nearby (New York) and the style of the announcement was very in keeping with how he likes to do things,” she said. “When we arrived there was full security detail and barriers set up. So we waited.”  And waited. And waited.  Webster says she often works with high-profile touring artists.  “I’ve managed guest lists for ‘surprise shows’ and most of the time they are kept fairly secret within the own artist camps as everyone has a hard time keeping a secret. What I’m saying is, it’s not an easy task to execute this kind of thing.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  Morin noted that this wouldn’t have been the first time Prince played a secret show.  In February last year, the performer played two consecutive surprise sets at the Electric Ballroom in London, England, and in British folksinger Lianne La Havas’s home.  Those shows were also sparked by a cryptic tweet from 3rdeyegirl.  With files from Ben Rayner  Read more about:"
1,"In the film Fight Club, groups of bored men led by Brad Pitt were depicted meeting up in secret to take part in bare knuckle brawls.  But a new web-based application promises to make such fights a reality by pitting violent strangers against each other.  Described as a Tinder for Fight Club, Rumblr allows users to arrange impromptu fights based on their location.  Rumblr has been described as 'Tinder for Fight Club' (left). It allows users to upload pictures of themselves along with a short profile so they can challenge other users and arrange to meet them for a fight (right)  It features a chat function to allow opponents to trash talk each other and an interactive map showing where fights are happening so others can go along to watch.  According to the app creator's website: 'Rumblr is an app for recreational fighters to find, meet, and fight other brawl enthusiasts nearby.  IS THE RUMBLR APP LEGAL? People using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries. Fighting in a public place is classed as disorderly conduct while arranging a fight to be attended by an audience could be considered an unlawful public assembly. In some areas seriously injuring someone in a fight can result in criminal charges even if the other person does not seek to press charges. In response to questions from MailOnline, the app's developers did warn that some users may risk prosecution if they used the app to arrange a fight. They said: 'Depending on where they fight, they may be. Regulations are different for every municipality and governing body.' They added, however, that those who criticised the app for encouraging violence were 'not open minded enough about the community we are providing value to'. Advertisement  'You don't need to fight to use Rumblr.  'With Rumblr Explore, anyone can browse and attend fights close by that other Rumblr users have arranged - all for free.'  The app was initially due to be released on Apple's App Store, but was rejected.  Apple has strict rules about apps that encourage violence or result in physical harm.  Instead the app will be released as a web app, and it has already attracted more than 300,000 people from around the world.  Speaking to MailOnline, Rumblr's developers Matt Henderson and Jack Kim, said: 'We've been recreational fighters our entire lives and were tired of the inefficiencies that exist when trying to find someone to fight.  'Rumblr alleviates the trouble fighters have when searching for suitable opponents.  'We were actually rejected by Apple's App Store so we have decided to transition Rumblr into a public, globally accessible web application.'  The web app is due to be launched at at 5pm EST (10pm GMT) today.  According to the developers, it works by allowing users to build a profile of themselves, including statistics about their weight and ability.  The 1999 film Fight Club, starring Brad Pitt (pictured), showed groups of bored men meeting up at underground gatherings to fight each other. Rumblr aims to overcome some of the difficulties faced by real life 'recreational fighters' when looking for someone to challenge  Rumblr includes a chat feature that allows users to challenge each other, lay down insults and make arrangements for a brawl (left). They can then broadcast these details so they appear on a map (right), allowing other users to see fights that are happening in their area  The app uses these to match fighters together who are nearby, but it also allows users to challenge each other based on their profile picture.  It encourages the fighters to lay down a challenge by 'telling your match what you don't like about their picture'.  When a challenge is accepted, the users can arrange a time and location before broadcasting the final details to attract a cloud.  .@Capn_CoolChris Rumblr will be available as a web application at https://t.co/tcYjoatwH7 Monday, Nov. 9th at 5:00 PM EST. 👊 — Rumblr (@rumblrapp) November 9, 2015  WHY BOYS WITH BEARDS ARE BAD They may have become to the go-to fashion accessory for men, but those with beards are more likely to be sexist, get into fights, cheat on their partners and steal, two new studies have revealed. The first of the two surveys, which involved 500 men aged between 18 and 72 from India and the US, studied men with nine facial hairstyles varying in length - from light stubble to a heavy beard. The group was asked to pick one that best matched their own facial hair and were then asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements about gender roles. The results revealed that 86 per cent of Indian men and 65 per cent of American men had facial hair, and those with beards of any length agreed more with hostile sexist statements than men without any facial hair. Advertisement  Fights are shown on a map and can be filtered to see those nearby, those involving women - called RumblrHER - and group fights.  According to Daily News, an email to those who registered for early access also reportedly claimed to be giving away ten pairs of golden brass knuckles to ten people who tweet about the app.  However, those using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries.

1,"0  WASHINGTON, D.C. –  As it turns out, the Republicans may have been right all along, and President Obama is not the smartest person in the room after all. Since Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, all presidents have been given an IQ test at some point during their time as leader. Gerald Ford always held the record for lowest score, with a 111, which is considered just slightly above average. On the other end of the spectrum, George W. Bush scored a 132, which is considered ‘gifted.’ Two-Thirds of people who take the standardized IQ test score between 85-115.  The White House today spun President Obama’s 102 as a ‘solid average’ that is nothing to be ashamed of.  ”President Obama never claimed to be smarter than anybody else. As a matter as fact, he has always represented himself as a regular guy, ‘a man of the people,’ as it were,” said Josh Earnest, White House Press Secretary. “The key to being a good leader is to surround yourself with smart people, which President Obama has always done. As far as needing to be a genius to run the country, well – George W. Bush had the highest score ever, and look at how that mess turned out. So, the next time President Obama bypasses congress with an executive order, and you’re about to say something cruel, racist, or otherwise completely ignorant, remember that he’s just a regular guy getting things done for you. And hey! At least he’s in the triple digits!”  “Ha! I knew it! King Obama is just a few points away from being a dummy,” said Senator Ted Cruz. ”Einstein was a 160, and guess what America – I scored 145! I’m smarter than 99% of you! When I’m elected President, I’ll bring some common sense and smarts back into the White House. Let’s face it, don’t you want your President to be smarter than the guy asking you whether you want to ‘super size’ your fries at the drive through? ‘Vote for me America, I’m smart!’ Hell, I think I’ll make that a bumper sticker!”  0  Comments  comments"

You don’t have to be deprived of the beautiful and womanly occurrence of menstruation merely because you were born without uterus. The Fem-Flo’s cotton core contains a small, vegetable-based capsule which upon reaching body temperature releases the “menses” contained within. It also aids in keeping the post-op canal conditioned and dilated after surgery and beyond.”  Although United Media Publishing‘s web site doesn’t feature a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, earlier articles from that outlet include a false claim that Charles Manson had died in prison and another fabricated story about Christian couples “divorcing en masse” in protest of same-sex marriage.  Interest in the transgender tampons claim peaked on 9 July 2015, when Twitter and Internet forum posters said that radio host Rush Limbaugh had discussed the article on his show. Some tweets suggested that Limbaugh was initially unaware of the article’s satirical nature, though no transcript of the portion of the show in question was available for review to document that assertion:  @rushlimbaugh just pushed a fake story about transgender tampons, realized it during commercial break and tried to play it off. #FAIL — John Harris (@YahyaJohn) July 9, 2015  A Google search for “Sappho-Luxe” returned results solely for the original fake news article and content based upon it.

1,"(CNN) In Hollywood, there's no better magnet for stargazing than a movie premiere. So on a Sunday afternoon in late June, the summer sun couldn't keep thousands of fans from lining Hollywood Boulevard, hoping to spot a star.  This was the ""Terminator Genisys"" premiere , and only one star mattered: Arnold Schwarzenegger . The former governor of California shook hands, signed autographs and posed for selfies. It's the kind of personal attention Fred and Kathy Santos wish they could get from Schwarzenegger , who they say stole justice from their dead son.  ""He plays a hero in the movies, yet in real life he's not a hero,"" Fred Santos said. ""He's a dirty politician.""  Minutes before ending his two terms as governor, Schwarzenegger issued his final act: Commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing to death the Santos' son, Luis, in 2008.  It's not that a governor issuing clemency was anything new. But neither the Santos family nor San Diego County prosecutors had any idea it was coming, let alone got a chance to plead their case. Instead, they were informed by a news release and a phone call from a reporter.  ""My son (was) stabbed in the heart when he was alive,"" Fred Santos told CNN. ""Schwarzenegger stabbed him in the back after my son is killed.""  At first, Fred Santos asked himself why the governor would care about their case. But deep down he knew. Santos feared political influence from the beginning -- ever since learning that Esteban Nunez wasn't just any accused killer.  He was the son of Fabian Nunez, California's most powerful Democrat and a political ally to the governor. So to many, such as San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, Schwarzenegger's surprise commutation appeared as if Nunez was cashing in.  ""I think it was political cronyism at its worst.""  The speaker's son, a brutal crime  When Fabian Nunez was sworn in as speaker of the California Assembly in 2004, his son was by his side. At 15, Esteban Nunez appeared baby-faced and shy -- nothing like the muscular, tattooed adult described in court records just four years later.  It was October 2008, and prosecutors alleged that Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were fueling their anger with alcohol. They had just been denied entry to a fraternity party near the campus of San Diego State University (neither were students there), and they were looking for revenge. The Sacramento natives were going to show them how it was done ""in Sac town,"" the pair boasted, according to court records.  ""They decided they were going to either burn a frat house or they were going to stab some people,"" Dumanis said.  Armed with knives, they walked the streets at 2 a.m. until they encountered Luis Santos and a friend. After an initial altercation, Luis called several more friends who ran to his aid.  ""It was a melee basically, where two of the boys were stabbed. One went into an induced coma,"" Dumanis said. ""Luis was stabbed, and one got smashed in the eye.""  ""My boy's dying, my boy's dying,"" Luis' friend screamed to a 911 dispatcher.  ""Stay awake Luis, stay awake,"" another friend sobbed.  A knife pierced the left ventricle of Luis' heart. He died at the scene.  Later that same night, Nunez, Jett and two others piled into a car and headed north to Sacramento. Surveillance video at a 7-Eleven captured Jett and Nunez leaving the store with a Big Gulp cup. They filled it with $1.30 worth of gasoline and used it to burn their weapons and bloody clothes, throwing the items into the Sacramento River and agreeing to never speak of the incident.  But witnesses helped police identify four suspects, and two of them weren't so quiet. The pair fingered Nunez and Jett as the stabbers, later getting probation in exchange for their testimony.  Two months after getting a phone call that their son was dead, the phone rang again at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. Their son's alleged killers were behind bars, and a reporter had a question: What was their reaction to the son of Fabian Nunez being arrested for Luis' murder?  ""My concern was that politics might interfere with justice in the legal system,"" Fred Santos told CNN.  Though assured the system would not bend to politics, Santos says he grew up in Asia, where ""politicians are dirty.""  ""I asked if the judge was a Democrat,"" he said, believing Fabian Nunez's power in that party would influence the case.  The judge was a Republican. In time, however, the judge would become the least of Santos' worries.  Foes to friends  By the time Esteban Nunez was charged with murder, his father had already derailed Arnold Schwarzenegger's early years in office. The Republican governor tried to bypass Nunez and the Democrats by calling for too many special elections on pet projects, with failing results.  ""I got to tell you, things are very sloppy here on the first floor,"" Nunez once told reporters, referring to the governor's office.  Schwarzenegger returned the jab in private conversations that were recorded and later released to news organizations.  ""Fabian is too much a political operator,"" he told his staff, apparently unaware of the recording. ""Not so much passion about specific things he stands for.""  But with his policies stalling in Sacramento, Schwarzenegger announced a shift in strategy in a State of the State address, conceding his mistakes and pledging to work with Nunez and the Democrats. The tactic proved beneficial for both sides. The pair stood side-by-side when California passed legislation creating the highest minimum wage in the nation, one of many victories out of a newly minted political friendship.  In 2008, though, Schwarzenegger did not publicly get involved in Nunez's personal problems. Instead, with his son facing a first degree murder charge and fighting for a lower bail amount, Fabian Nunez called on his Democratic friends to vouch for the credibility of his son. A union leader, a retired assemblyman and even then-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa submitted letters to the judge.  On official mayoral stationery, Villaraigosa wrote that Esteban had shared meals at his home and that he was ""a young man of good and upright character.""  ""They already have the mayor trying to influence the judge,"" Fred Santos said. ""Nobody in power was speaking (for us). We're just regular folks.""  The deal  In 2010, Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were moments away from their murder trial. A first degree conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. A second degree conviction, 15 to life.  But then, with jury selection already underway, came the next twist in this case: a plea deal for Nunez and Jett. If the pair pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, they would face a maximum of 16 years behind bars. For the Santos family it sounded too brief, but would offer swift justice and an end to years of future pain.  ""So we will not be spending the rest of our lives going to court ... listening to them fight their appeal if they were convicted,"" Fred Santos said.  For District Attorney Dumanis, a plea bargain also removed, in her mind, the only impediment to an otherwise airtight case: proving who actually stabbed Luis.  Witness testimony pointed to Jett as Luis' killer, while Nunez stabbed two other boys who survived. Was that enough to pin first- or second-degree murder on Esteban Nunez? The question no longer needed an answer when all sides agreed to a deal. Nunez and Jett pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.  ""I couldn't believe we were giving this case away,"" said Rick Clabby, then deputy district attorney, in an interview with CNN.  Now retired, Clabby believes the evidence was strong enough for at least a second-degree murder conviction.  ""We charged Nunez with conspiracy, too,"" Clabby said. ""It didn't matter if the jury couldn't decide who was the stabber.""  But Dumanis stressed the emotional toll on the victims and approved the deal.  As part of the plea, Nunez admitted that his actions led to the death of Luis Santos. Both Nunez and Jett were sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison.  Calling it ""bitter satisfaction,"" the Santoses thought their son's newly confessed killers would go away quietly and pay for their crimes, content with the plea deal they had just reached.  ""Had I known what was going to happen,"" said Dumanis, ""that (deal) never would have been an agreement.""  The governor's final act  On January 2, 2011, six months after their son's convicted killers were sent to prison, the phone rang at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. It was another reporter.  ""That's been the story of our life, a reporter calls the house and gives me information,"" said Kathy Santos.  This time, she was told of the surprise commutation and immediately went online for more information.  ""There was Esteban's face,"" she said, ""with a little blurb about Arnold's dirty deed.""  Minutes before leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced the commutation in an emailed news release. Esteban Nunez's sentence had been cut in half. He would be eligible for release in April of 2016.  ""I was so disgusted,"" Kathy Santos said. ""Esteban has been coddled, he hasn't had to be accountable because apparently his father has gotten him off.""  Fabian Nunez has publicly denied he forced Schwarzenegger into granting a favor, but he also wasn't complaining. Nunez has repeatedly maintained that his son got a raw deal because he was related to a powerful lawmaker.  ""From the beginning, my son was the headliner in the case,"" Nunez told CNN affiliate KCRA in 2011. He declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview, but after an initial version of this story aired on television, Nunez spoke to CNN over the phone.  ""This has gone from aiding and abetting to him being labeled a killer,"" Nunez said of his son.  He argues that comments from the Santos family, their attorneys and the district attorney's office have boiled the case down to a convenient narrative: Esteban Nunez accepted a plea deal, then had it cut in half because of the influence of his father. In reality, Fabian Nunez told CNN, ""the case is more complicated,"" and that his son sought clemency to right wrongs perpetrated on them by an ""overzealous district attorney"" and a ""conservative judge.""  ""My son did not want to take the deal"" if it meant he had to accept 16 years behind bars, Nunez said. ""He was going to go to trial"" and defend his position that Esteban was not nearly the aggressor that the prosecution was making him out to be.  ""This was a fight among a large group"" of people, Fabian Nunez said, adding that the two suspects who were given probation in exchange for their testimony ""were just as responsible as my son.""  In a letter to the court objecting to the sentence, Fabian Nunez claims the judge overreached in giving Esteban the full 16 years because his son, unlike Jett, ""had no criminal record"" and that Esteban ""did not harm Mr. Santos,"" referring to the witness who claimed Jett inflicted the fatal blow.  Fabian Nunez went on to claim his son was misled by the judge, who ""told us that (he) would treat Esteban differently"" from Jett.  ""He told the attorney one thing in chambers, then went into open court and said another,"" Fabian Nunez told CNN.  Prosecutors maintain they warned Esteban in open court that he could receive 16 years.  The judge denied that he made conflicting statements and refused to reconsider the sentence.  Esteban Nunez and his attorneys continued their fight until December 6, when they submitted a motion to end their appeal.  Less than a month later, Nunez received clemency.  ""I believe Nunez's sentence is excessive,"" wrote Schwarzenegger in his commutation letter, citing the lack of criminal history and the inability to prove that Nunez actually stabbed Luis Santos.  ""It was a complete betrayal of a system of justice and fairness,"" said Dumanis, the district attorney, who questions whether Nunez even submitted a clemency application to the governor. Nunez's attorney, Charles Sevilla, told CNN he did but refused to release it.  Upon his exit, Schwarzenegger ordered all clemency files sealed for 25 years. (That's not necessarily unusual. Schwarzenegger's predecessor, Gray Davis, did the same thing.)  In his only comment about the case, Schwarzenegger told Newsweek, ""There's criticism out there. I think it's just because of our (Fabian Nunez) working relationship and all that. It maybe was kind of saying, 'That's why he did it.' Well, hello! I mean, of course you help a friend.""  Fabian Nunez told CNN he was told by Schwarzenegger that the comments were ""taken out of context."" Still, the Santos family attorney, Nina Solarno, was outraged.  ""He took a political favor and played God, and took justice away from this family,"" claimed Solarno, who is also a board member for the advocacy group Crime Victims United.  In a private letter to the Santos family, Schwarzenegger wrote: ""I recognize that the last minute nature of my final acts as Governor provided you no notice, no time to prepare for or absorb the impact of this decision. For that, I apologize.""  It was an apology the Santos family would not accept.  Taking on the Terminator  While Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Hollywood in 2011, Fred and Kathy Santos returned to court. Along with the San Diego County district attorney, they filed suit alleging Gov. Schwarzenegger violated ""Marsy's Law,"" which mandates that victims' families be given a right to speak in all proceedings related to their case.  It was the last chance Dumanis had to keep Esteban Nunez behind bars and repair the damage from what she considered a tremor shaking the entire system.  ""When a governor commutes a sentence in such a flagrantly political way, it puts everybody in the system on notice that their (deals) are not safe,"" Dumanis said.  While agreeing Schwarzenegger's move was ""grossly unjust"" and ""deserving of censure,"" two separate judges concluded that it was not illegal and that ""Marsy's Law"" applied to parole hearings, not executive clemency.  Schwarzenegger, for now, had won. But both the Santoses and San Diego prosecutors were not giving up.  They succeeded in changing the state law, which now requires California governors to give victims and prosecutors at least 10 days of notice before issuing clemency. That will ensure Luis Santos' case isn't repeated, but it won't keep Esteban Nunez from being released.  While the Santos family will next petition the state Supreme Court, they know time is running out.  ""Esteban is going to be out before we get to the Supreme Court,"" Solarno conceded. ""Now we want an acknowledgment that the family's rights were taken from them, that they should have been heard, and that from this day forward your case is setting precedent that other victims are going to be heard.""  Arnold Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN's requests for a formal interview, but when questioned by CNN at the ""Terminator Genysis"" premiere in June, he would not speak about the case.  ""Since we're here today for the movie promotion, we talk movies,"" he said.  ""That's the type of person he is,"" said Fred Santos. ""He thinks somebody being murdered -- it's news that is below his status.""  ""I get their pain,"" Fabian Nunez said, adding that his attempt to reach out to the Santos family wasn't accepted. ""I get to see my son, they don't get to see theirs ... but I make no apologies for fighting for justice for my son.""  For Rick Clabby, the vocal former prosecutor, the Santos family has been victimized too many times in this case.  ""They were victimized when their son was murdered, they were victimized when our office made this stupid decision and they were victimized when the governor buddied up with Mr. Nunez,"" Clabby told CNN.  But Fred and Kathy Santos say they'll continue to fight. They're not sure where it will lead them, but they know they have to keep trying.  ""We weren't there to protect Luis, to prevent him from being killed,"" Fred Santos said. ""This is the only thing we can do for him."""
1,"News 8 – A disturbing report is coming out of that Baton Rouge, Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors who reportedly starved her children nearly to death. The 27-year-old mother of 7 was arrested on Thursday evening when neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door, they were greeted by three-year-old Amonte Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who let them into the home. Authorities say they found the Lakisha Connors passed out on the couch.  “The house was disgusting, probably the worst I’ve ever seen,” said police chief Ronnie Hernandes. “When we enter the home, we found seven children who looked extremely malnourished. In addition to that there was a lock on the refrigerator and all nonperishable foods were locked in a huge wooden makeshift storage container in the mother’s bedroom.”  Neighbors say that Connors moved into this rental home about six weeks ago.  “Lakisha just moved in not too long ago. This was the first time I had ever seen any children!” said a neighbor who wishes to stay anonymous. “But we see her almost every day coming into the house with groceries. So for her children to be starting like that was absolutely shocking!”  Authorities on the scene say when Lakisha was awoke by the police, she was very combative. “We pulled her up off the couch and asked her to explain herself,” said Hernandes. “When asked why her children were in this condition, Lakisha plainly said, without any remorse, ‘There was only enough food for me! Them kids get on my nerves. But they eat, they eat my scraps. I’m a big girl I need more than them!'”  The 7 children, whose ages range from 1 to 11 years of age, were taken into protective custody by Child Protective Services.  Lakisha is currently being held on a $500 bond."
1,"UPDATE: KIRO-7 has done a great job following up on this story  7-Eleven sent a new statement from its corporate office in Dallas. It reads:  “It’s clear that a misunderstanding occurred at a franchised 7-Eleven store. We understand that a customer presented a military ID as a form of identification when buying age-restricted products, and the Franchisee’s store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, was required to ask to see a second form of ID with a birthdate. After the customer’s age was verified, the transaction was completed. Serving members of the military, being named a top military-friendly company and employing military veterans are great honors for 7-Eleven.”  The owner of the Redmond West Lake Sammamish Parkway 7-Eleven sent this response on Thursday, calling the incident a misunderstanding:  “We sincerely apologize for a misunderstanding that occurred at one of our stores. A customer presented a military ID as a form of identification and the store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, asked to see a second form of ID. After the customers age was verified the transaction was complete.”  Collin Brown told KIRO-TV, the clerk never stated that she could not read the date of birth on Brown’s military ID card.  Representatives from 7-Eleven corporation told KIRO-TV they planned to personally contact Collin Brown.  Collin Brown, reservist in the Army, entered his local 7/11 in Redmond, WA to buy a Slurpee and his fiancé a pack of cigarettes.  When he got to the counter he was asked for proof of age. He pulled out his military ID which has his date of birth on the back, and handed it to the cashier.  [revad1]  Brown told KIRO-7 that this is how the conversation went:  “She said, ‘You’re in the military?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘I can’t serve you.’ Honestly, I was in shock. I asked, ‘Are you serious?’ She looked at me like she was offended.”  Brown then asked why there was a problem, produced a backup ID and asked for her manager’s information.  When friends and relatives posted his tale on Facebook, it had 12,000 shares in mere days.  7/11 corporate offices replied online saying Brown’s story is “distorted,” and while they support out military what actually happened was:  “A customer presented a military ID as a form of identification and the store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, asked to see a second form of ID.”  Brown claims this is not what occurred and is asking the chain to investigate.  _______________________________  From KIRO-7  REDMOND, Wash. — A local soldier, whose story sparked a firestorm of nationwide anger on social media, says a Redmond convenience store clerk denied him service, after he showed his military ID.  Collin Brown –- who is a reservist in the Army – was purchasing cigarettes for his fiancé, and a Slurpee last Wednesday, at the 7-Eleven on West Lake Sammamish Parkway. Brown put his U.S. military ID on the counter, when the cashier asked for his proof of age. The ID clearly has his date of birth on the back and serves as legal ID.  “She said, ‘You’re in the military?’ I said, ‘Yes,’” Brown said. “She said, ‘I can’t serve you.'” Honestly, I was in shock. I asked, ‘Are you serious?’ “She looked at me like she was offended,” he said.  Brown says he asked the clerk why there was a problem as he pulled out his driver’s license to back up his military ID.  “I asked for her manager’s information and at that point I was able to make the purchase,” Brown said.

1,"By Jean-Francois Rosnoblet SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren. Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board. One of the plane's black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France's interior minister said. In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation. Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines. ""We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,"" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter. Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard. Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said. Barcelona's Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner's Siegfried at the theater. French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms. Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. ""We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,"" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters. In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: ""A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors."" It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets. It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December. SHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. ""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference. Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday. Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky. France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus. ""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground. The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in. “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a ""dark day for Lufthansa"". ""My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,"" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there. Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff. In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. ""The families knew each other,"" he told Reuters. ""The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning."" King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened. In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the ""awful tragedy"". Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

1,"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.  According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.  While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.  Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.  Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.  “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”  Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.  The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.  Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.  The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death."

1,"The most anti-woman Republican Party in American History escalated its attacks on women to deny wounded female veterans fertility treatments that would help them to have children in spite of wounds suffered while defending our country.    The Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act, a bill authored by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) that would require fertility treatment and counseling for ""severely wounded, ill, or injured"" military members or veterans, had been expected to proceed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday. But Murray said she has asked that the bill be pulled thanks to proposed amendments from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) -- including one that would have, in Tillis's words, prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from working with ""organizations that take human aborted babies' organs and sell them.""  Tillis, of course, is referring to the fraudulent and debunked video recorded in secret by other Republican operatives which claims to show Planned Parenthood officials engaged in the sale of fetal tissue. It does not matter to Tillis--or any Republican, it seems-- that the video was edited to deliberately deceive. It provides a ready excuse for Republican males to exercise control over women's bodies any way they possibly can, even if it means denying wounded women veterans the ability to have children. Republicans have seized on the altered and edited video as a bludgeon to carry on their attacks against Planned Parenthood, an organization they hate because it provides women with safe and legal family planning services, counseling, and assistance with terminating unwanted pregnancies.  In this case it's hard to tell whom Republicans hate more, women or veterans. Either way, the irony of denying women the ability to conceive by pandering to the anti-choice lobby seems to have been lost on Mr. Tillis and his Republican cohorts. To illustrate just how cynical and petty his rationale is, Tillis points to a $900 donation made by the VA to a group that he can't even identify as Planned Parenthood, as ""justification"" for blocking this funding:    Tillis cited a report by Congress' nonpartisan Government Accountability Office on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending for family planning and other health programs by six organizations, including Planned Parenthood. In a footnote, that report said the VA had spent $900 on one of the organizations, but it did not say which one had received the money.  A $900 donation, out of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is how extreme they are.  Senator Murray reacted with anger and dismay at the derailing of her legislation:    ""I know some Republicans are trying to use this latest issue as just one more opportunity to roll back the clock and take away women’s health care options,"" Murray said. ""We can have that fight. We’ve had it many times before. But don’t pull veterans into the middle of it. Don’t take something that should be above politics -- our sacred duty to our veterans -- and pull it down into the muck of petty politics. It’s not fair to veterans and their families, who have been hoping and praying for the opportunity to have children.""  Paralyzed Veterans of America is deeply disappointed to learn that S. 469, the 'Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act,' has been pulled from the Senate VA Committee markup this afternoon due to amendments that serve no function but histrionic political grandstanding. Shame on those who have placed political ideology ahead of the needs of veterans with catastrophic disabilities, particularly those with spinal cord injury or disease.  This bipartisan, critically needed legislation would lift an antiquated ban on VA providing fertility services to veterans who have incurred a severe injury to their reproductive organs. As a result of the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, many young service members have suffered grievous injuries from explosive devices that have made them unable to conceive a child naturally. While the Department of Defense does provide assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to service members, VA does not.  "
1,"On 3 September 2015, the Twitter account @banditqueen_ posted an image purportedly showing President Obama standing next to a mile 69 in Alaska. The accompanying message, “The Leader of Our Country,” was an attempt to show how Obama’s supposed juvenile sense of humor made him unfit to be President:  The photograph, however, was a digitally altered fake. The real image, taken near Exit Glacier in Alaska, was posted to the White House Instagram account on 2 September 2015 and showed President Obama posing next to a sign indicating where the boundary of the now much-receded glacier was in 1961 (coincidentally also the year of President Obama’s birth):  Markers throughout Exit Glacier show how much it’s receded over time. The impacts of climate change are real, and the people of Alaska are living with them every day. It’s never been more important for us to work together to address this challenge.  Other variations of this image have also made their way around the Internet, including one which purportedly showed President Obama posing next to a 420 mile marker:  The number 420, of course, is associated with smoking marijuana."
1,"OUTRAGE: Obama Orders Military to Stop Wearing Uniforms at Recruitment Centers to Hide from Terrorists  After last week’s terror attack on two military recruitment offices in Tennessee, Obama’s defense secretary has taken steps to stop future attacks. Has he moved to arm our soldiers? Nope. He’s ordered them to cower and hide by telling them to stop wearing their uniforms. You heard that right. Obama’s administration is demanding that soldiers stop wearing their uniforms so that terrorists won’t get mad.  Our soldiers are proud of their uniforms. But obviously Obama thinks our solders’ uniforms are just “triggers”for terrorists. This is an outrage.  According to the Military Times, Obama’s weak-kneed Defense Secretary Ash Cater approved the decree that recruiters should take off their uniforms while performing their recruitment duties from now on. …now soldiers are supposed to die at their desks and now don’t even have the benefit of dying in the uniform of their country! Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet And let’s not even mention that recruiting without a uniform proudly worn by a recruiter puts a serious dent in the whole emotional appeal of recruiting and will make the recruiter’s job harder. One of the whole aspects of being recruited is that potential recruits have a visceral reaction to the crisp, flashy uniform worn by their guide to the service. It’s part of the whole package to be able to show recruits how handsome, or how sharp and orderly they will look in their own uniforms when they get one. And now Obama wants to take that away from the services?  Obama wants our troops to cower in the face of the enemy. But then, he never liked our military anyway.  **UPDATE**  Now Obama says that military recruiters should just “close the blinds” on office windows to prevent terror attacks!! OUTRAGEOUS!"

It’s pretty exciting for those that do suffer, considering they will no longer have to rely on painkillers, with a long term cure that will cost them under £50.

Dr. Thomas Cohn took to his blog http://www. mnphysicalmedicine.com to talk about the connection between the piercing and the relief of migraines.  MORE: This one-year-old girl is the first person to be cured of ‘incurable’ cancer with ‘designer’ immune therapy  He wrote: ‘Recently, some people who have received a Daith piercing have coincidentally found improvement with their migraine headaches. It is not universal, and it is has not been studied formally.’  ‘If a person enjoys ear piercing and suffers from frequent headaches, it may be worthwhile to consider getting this spot pierced. Since body piercings are generally less than $100, this may be a very economical treatment alternative.’  HOW CAN 'DAITH' PIERCINGS HELP RELIEVE A MIGRAINE? The theory that daith piercings help ease migraines is based on the idea that it is the same pressure point as that targeted by acupuncturists to relieve chronic headaches Acupuncture, a therapy which began in China more than 2,000 years ago, involves placing fine needles at specific pressure points on the body’s surface.  The needles are then manipulated by a acupuncturist, either manually or electrically. It causes the blood vessels around the needle to open up and become wider, allowing for an increase in blood flow to the tissues in the immediate area. A report published in 2012 in the Archives of Internal Medicine analysed nearly 18,000 patients and doctors from eight universities and hospitals in the UK, US and Germany. The results showed in conditions including chronic headache, acupuncture was twice as effective as the drugs and exercise recommended by most doctors. The Migraine Relief Center recognises the link, albeit a unproven one, between ‘daith’ piercings and easing migraine symptoms. ‘The principle is that the piercing mimics acupuncture by hitting a pressure point, which relieves the pressure in the patient’s head,’ a blog on the website states. ‘By having it done on the same side as most migraines occur, it’s thought to help reduce the incidence of migraines in the area.’ But, it cautions: ‘At this point, the effect of daith piercings on migraine has not been officially studied so it’s difficult to determine whether there’s any truth to the claims or not.’  MORE: Have scientists just found a cure for baldness?

1,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.  Prince has performed several times in Toronto, and owned a home in Canada’s largest city when he was married to Toronto-born Manuela Testolini from 2001 to 2006.  He released his latest record, ""Art Official Age,"" in September.  Donna Grantis, a guitarist in 3rdeyegirl, is from nearby Mississauga.  With a report from CTV Toronto's Andria Case"
1,"A German man has taken a court order to give his ex-wife half of his property after their divorce somewhat literally. He has cut up his stuff, from a car down to an iPhone, with power tools. He’s now selling his share on eBay.  The identity of the divorced man is unknown, but he goes by the name “Der Juli” online. He posted a YouTube video for a Laura, presumably his former wife, thanking her for “12 beautiful years” together and saying she had earned half of the household. He also claims that his ex was unfaithful.  An iPhone, a flatscreen TV and even an Opel Corsa are all meticulously sawn in half in the video. The man in the clip appears to be the handling power tools quite professionally.  The halves “Der Juli” considers rightfully his are currently for sale on eBay. A total of 16 items are offered. Buyers in need of half a teddy bear, half a bicycle or half a vinyl record of R.E.M. album “Automatic for the People” should keep in mind that shipping is only available in Germany.  Each item has a humorous if disgruntled description. The car is said to be well-preserved for its age, but have signs of wear. “In particular, half is missing,” it says. Of the bed, “Der Juli” writes that, unlike his ex, he cannot say anything bad about it. A set of four half-chairs, he believes, would make a good art installation. And the half-DVD of a German nighttime comedy show he’s selling contains the best sketches, he says.  One of the items is half a motorcycle helmet, which, “Der Juli” says, offers good visibility on the right side. The semi-protective gear is on the head of a tanned man, who appears to be in his 40s, his eyes painted over to make recognition difficult. Presumably, it’s the eponymous seller himself.  It’s not clear whether the divorce story is true or just a hoax. The video has scored over 3.3 million views since its publication on Tuesday, so one way or another, “Der Juli” seems to have made his point.  Splitting everything literally in half is not as uncommon in divorces as you might think.  In 2008, a 76-year-old Serbian farmer, married for 45 years, used a grinding machine to cut in half his farm tools and machines to comply with a court ruling to share the household goods with his ex. He was still thinking about how to split the cow, reports said."

1,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner.

The hostage incident comes after police carried out a series of major anti-terrorism raids throughout Sydney in September.

1,"A petition addressed to Adele, President Obama, and Billboard on Change.org demands that the singer admit that she has “little talent” and is succeeding mainly because of her white privilege.  “Adele sold over 3.38 million copies of her album ‘25′ and the media is praising her as if Adele’s success has everything to do with talent,” reads the petition, written by Rhianna Jones.  Advertisement  “Rather, it’s her white privilege that has put her on top,” it declares.  The petitioners also “demand that Adele donates her money to African-American causes such as #Blacklivesmatter.”  It’s not clear why exactly the petition is also addressed to President Obama — perhaps Ms. Jones is outraged that the leader of the free world hasn’t pushed the less important issues like ISIS aside to deal with the more serious ones like a singer’s being white and successful at the same time. (I mean, would an executive order requiring Adele to admit she is only successful because she is white and give away her money to people who are not white in order to stay in the country really be too much to ask?)  #share#Honestly, Adele is an interesting target for this kind of criticism. First of all, despite the fact that some might think this would be impossible for a white person, Adele actually had a pretty tough upbringing: Her father was an admitted drunk who walked out on the family when she was just three years old. Second — white or not — hardly anyone thinks of Adele as having the typical look of a successful female performer. Whether someone is calling her fat or asking her how she manages to handle weighing more than others in her industry, any discussion of her image concerns how different she looks and how tough it must be to look that way.  #related#Although Jones’s petition had just 31 supporters at the time of publication, its very existence is ridiculous enough — and for so many reasons. After all, even if Adele did have a privileged upbringing and was a size 0 with D-cups, saying that she has just “a little talent” is objectively wrong. “A little talent” is the kind of phrase you use to describe someone who had the best voice in the high-school choir before going on to realize she needed to get a real job. Fan or not, anyone with ears and the ability to know what words mean would have to admit that Adele falls into a different category."
1,"Middle Eastern men purchased dozens of burner cell phones at Walmarts in and around Lebanon, Missouri (ostensibly to carry out terror attacks); at the same time, multiple stores reported propane tank thefts.  Ones casualities start coming in due to your blatant disregard and obvious knowing of those Muslim extremists buying those burner phones, we the people will blame you. There was more than enough reasonable suspicion to arrest those foreigners on a probable threat of terrorism. THey are not US citizens, they don't need due process like AMericans. You're just as bad as the UK police and too intimidated to do a damn thing about it! Now they are gone....and we have NO IDEA what they are planning, whether its suicide bombing or somethng else. THANKS, YOU GUYS DID A BANGUP JOB!!! You're idiots! ____________________________________________________________________________________ Published on Dec 11, 2015 www.undergroundworldnews.com The FBI has launched an investigation after 150 prepaid mobile phones were bought from local Walmarts in Missouri. This comes after the theft of dozens oftanks in the area. The large number of purchases took place at six Missouri Walmarts at least, authorities say, according to KRCG13.  You won't hear this on the news! Lebanon, MO #walmart #muslims enter at 4:30 am and try to buy 60 cellphones. #WakeUpAmerica  A large portion of the phones were bought by “three men with accents” at one Walmart near the town of Lebanon,... https://t.co/L4KP94rUYD  Law enforcement has linked the cell phone purchases or stolen propane tanks to each other and/or terrorists.  Police investigated reports of large cell phone purchases in several Missouri Walmarts; the county sheriff's office later confirmed that the reports were unrelated to terrorism.  On or around 5 December 2015, rumors began circulating on social media regarding a large purchase of pre-paid cell phones at a Walmart in Lebanon, Missouri, which later included similar suspicious purchases at other Walmarts in the area.  On 9 December 2015, mid-Missouri station KMIZ published an article reporting that law enforcement authorities in at least four Missouri cities had received reports of suspicious phone purchases at area WalMart stores:  [S]omeone tried to buy a suspicious number of phones at Wal-Mart East in Jefferson City. The latest report is in addition to three other reports of similar incidents in Columbia, Macon and Lebanon. Authorities in all four cities said they had contacted FBI agents. However, the FBI only confirmed it is investigating three of those reports.  The reports described by KMIZ were attributed to Walmart employees and an eyewitness who wished to remain anonymous, and they described two men who had purchased 60 phones at the Lebanon WalMart:  [We] talked to a witness who didn’t want to be identified said the men paid with cash. “Right then and there I knew there was not something adding up about this. It’s not right, it doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “Who’s going to order 50 phones for Christmas? Who does that?” The man who saw the phones being purchased in Columbia said he instantly thought the men were up to no good. “That’s the first thing that ran through my mind that something bad could happen,” he said. “You know, they could be using these phones for terrorist acts.”  We contacted the Lebanon Police Department to gather additional information, but the individual with whom we spoke directed us to the FBI’s local field office for more information. A police report [PDF] available on the jurisdiction’s web site indicated that police were summoned to the Lebanon Walmart in the early hours of 5 December 2015. The report didn’t indicate who made the report (whether it was a bystander or employee), what the suspicious activity in question was (aside from the purchase of unspecified electronics), nor that the incident was viewed as suspicious by the officer:  On Saturday December 5, 2015 at approximately 0352 hours I was dispatched to 1800 S. Jefferson in reference to suspicious activity regarding electronics purchasing. Upon my arrival, I made contact with two male subjects that were pointed out by store employees. Upon speaking the two males, it was determined that there was no further reason to detain the subjects and they were allowed to leave. Nothing further at this time.  Social media users excoriated local law enforcement agents for not detaining the men, but the police report explicitly stated that there was no lawful reason to do so.  Altogether, five similar incidents were reported at WalMart stores in Columbia, Jefferson City, Macon, Jackson, and Lebanon. Missouri law enforcement officials alerted the FBI after a small number of men bought more than 100 pre-paid cellphones from WalMart stores in three different cities over a 24-hour period.  Macon County sheriff’s Detective Curt Glover said that although law enforcement were called to investigate the purchases, no arrests were made in connection with them because no laws had been broken:  “There’s no violation of criminal law, as far as we’re aware,” Glover said. “They can go to a retail store and buy as many items as they wish. But when they buy a high number of one item most people wouldn’t buy, it’s cause for suspicion.” An FBI spokeswoman in Kansas City, Missouri, Bridget Patton, said it is not uncommon for local law enforcement to contact that federal agency if they deem something suspicious. Patton would not say if the FBI is formally investigating. Prepaid cellphones, popular among international travelers and consumers with poor credit, also are commonly used by drug dealers and gang members because they don’t require personal data be given to the seller or service provider, masking the user’s identity. Such phones also have been linked to suspected terror activity including by a man accused of plotting to bomb Times Square in 2010 and using a prepaid phone to communicate with co-conspirators in Pakistan.  An iteration of the rumor held that reported thefts of propane tanks might (unspecifically) be related to the cell phone purchases. On 11 December 2015 the web site BuzzPo reported that:  The FBI is on alert to a possible terrorist plot after dozens of propane tanks were stolen, and about 150 pre-paid cell phones were purchased by ‘three men with accents.’ … If that’s not enough, the U.S. Air Force reported that two Afghan students from Georgia missing as well. Obviously, the missing Georgia Air Force students aren’t necessarily connected to the stolen propane and purchased cell phones. But in light of recent events, it shouldn’t necessarily be ruled out either.  However, that claim came one day after a 10 December 2015 report from Kansas City station WDAF that both addressed and countered speculation that the missing propane tanks were a likely sign of imminent terror attacks:  Now, another incident has some people wondering if we are in danger of a terrorist attack in our area. A large number of propane tanks have been reported stolen from several locations is Independence and Lee’s Summit … At the end of November, a BP gas station in Lee’s Summit reported 18-20 propane tanks stolen from the outside cages. That same night the CVS on Southwest 3rd Street reported the exact same crime. While there are several ways those tanks and cell phones phones can be used, in this climate, terror attacks are always a consideration. Retired FBI agent Michael Tabman says it is up to law enforcement to investigate and try to connect the dots. “Certainly, we hear something about gas being stolen we worry about a potential bomb. The good news is this is probably not part of terrorist planning for a number of reasons,” Tabman said. “One is they wouldn’t steal these items because they know that would attract law enforcement’s attention. Also this would not be a tool of choice,” he continued.  On 11 December 2015, the Macon County Sheriff’s Office published a Facebook post confirming that the cell phone purchases were unrelated to terrorism. According to that post, the “cell phones [were] not believed to be purchased for use in criminal activity,” but rather “purchased in a region for a low price and shipped to another region and sold to the general population for a large profit”:"

The masked, Kalashnikov-toting shooters moved with military precision, and then escaped following the 11:30 a.m. attack at Charlie Hebdo, the publication known for challenging Muslim terrorists with a 2011 caricature of Prophet Muhammed on its cover and which recently tweeted a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and were being sought.

Two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.  One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.  All three remain at large.  Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.  “We’ve avenged the honor of the prophet!” the killers shouted, according to witnesses who spoke to Sky News.

Hollande added that the publication had been threatened in the past and was already under police protection and surveillance.  “This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,” Hollande told reporters.  Officials said the men walked into the ground floor of the publication's offices and began shooting before making their way up to the first floor. Cartoonist Corine Rey, aka “Coco,” told the weekly Humanité that she let the men inside the building of Charlie Hebdo after being ordered at gunpoint.  “They spoke perfect French,"" said Rey, who said the rampage lased about five minutes. ""They said they were Al Qaeda.”  Related Image Expand / Contract The video still image shows the blurred-out image of a Paris police officer being shot by the fleeing gunmen. (Sky News)  Witnesses said the attack was carried out commando-style, with the gunmen demanding the names of those they encountered, indicating that they had specific targets in mind.  “It was a real butchery,” Rocco Contento, a spokesman for the Unité police union, told The Guardian.  Benoit Bringer, a journalist from the agency Premieres Lignes Tele, whose offices are next door, told the Telegraph he took refuge on the building's roof.  ""Three policemen arrived by push bike, but they left naturally as the attackers were armed,"" he said.  The publication's offices are in the trendy 11th arrondissement of Paris, which includes posh restaurants and retail shops. It is one of the most densely populated districts in all of Europe and is home to a large, mostly Algerian, Muslim community. Schools in the area were closed and newspaper offices, shopping centers, museums and stations were placed under police protection.  Charlie Hebdo first gained notoriety in 2006, when it reprinted a dozen cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that appeared in Danish daily Jyllands-Posten, in defiance of Islam's forbidding of any image attempting to portray its most important prophet. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. Nearly a year later, the magazine published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations around the Muslim world. One of the dead in Wednesday's attack was satirical cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, the publication's editorial director and the artist behind the caricatures that offended jihadists. He was the subject of a fatwah, and there is a Facebook page called ""Execute Stephane Charbonnier.""

Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, Gérard Biard, escaped the attack because he was in London. He expressed his shock and said the magazine had had no specific threats of violence.  Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, told The Associated Press another cartoonist named Jean Cabut, known by the pen name Cabu was killed. Other reports said cartoonists Georges Wolinski and Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac were killed.  A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said one of the two police officers killed was one assigned as Charbonnier's bodyguard after prior death threats against him.  Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced death threats after several newspapers published his images of Muhammad, recently presented Charlie Hebdo with his ""Gold Dog"" prize, said the attack, in spite of security for Charlie Hebdo staffers, shows it is ""impossible to guard [them] when it comes to attackers armed to the teeth.""

Advertisement - story continues below  On Tuesday, lawmakers in both houses of Congress filed legislation that would formally designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a sanctioned terrorist organization.  According to the Washington Free Beacon, the legislation outlined the Brotherhood’s long history of sponsoring terror activities as reason why the Muslim Brotherhood should be classified as a global terror group.  This bill would force Secretary of State John Kerry to explain why the Obama administration has until now been reluctant to label the Brotherhood as anything other than what it is … a terrorist organization.  Advertisement - story continues below  A similar bill failed last year. Sen. Ted Cruz sponsored the new legislation in the Senate while Rep. Mario Diaz did he same for the House version of the bill.  “We have to stop pretending that the Brotherhood are not responsible for the terrorism they advocate and finance,” Cruz told the Free Beacon. “We have to see it for what it is: a key international organization dedicated to waging violent jihad.”  “Since the Obama administration refuses to utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ … Congress owes it to the American people to tell them the truth about this threat,” he added.  Of course, this is the administration that lets Iran get nukes, fights to protect Muslims whenever they are “targeted,” upbraids Christians of perpetrating the Crusades 500 years after the fact and frees top terrorists from Guantanamo Bay.

1,"COLORADO – 15 Colorado McDonald franchises have announced that they are converting their McDonald’s Play Place areas into marijuana friendly smoking areas. Each facility will consist of 15 smoking pods in which customers can smoke a joint, bong, or pipe without being harassed or bothered by people who are offended by it.  Each pod not only contains the marijuana smoke within it’s small space, but also it repels the smell of the marijuana through a ventilation tube above the pod. So, although the doors are sealed in this previous “Play Place” location, the smell of marijuana will not seep into the main restaurant as people enter and exit the facility.  Two restaurants in Denver, Colorado have successfully converted the play areas into a marijuana smoking section, with the other 13 franchises to complete renovations by the end of 2015. As for now, McDonald’s will not be getting into the sale of marijuana or marijuana edibles. However, they do welcome their patrons to have a smoke before ordering.  http://straightstoned.com/pro-lifers-declare-ejaculation-murder-every-sperm-cell-life/"
1,"FACT CHECK: Did a young man named Jammal Longmire threaten in a Facebook post to shoot police officers?  Claim: A young man named Jammal Longmire threatened in a Facebook post to shoot police officers.  PROBABLY FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail and Twitter, September 2015]  A friend shared a post on Facebook that shares a young man, Jammal Longmire holding 2 automatic weapons with the comment reading, Young men get your guns and kill them white ass policemen, do not think about it just do it. Call them bitches out set them up with two in the head.” I find this incredibly disturbing if it is in fact true and believe it should be reported if found to be factual. Jammal Longmire, actually a black terrorist who tweeted pictures of himself with guns wanting to kill policemen or is it a conservative scare tactic?  Outspoken #BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops #BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb — Dr. White (@RealDoctorWhite) June 10, 2015  Origins: In June 2015, a screenshot of a Facebook post began circulating on social media, featuring an image that appeared to depict a young black man named Jammal Longmire posing with two guns and issuing the above-quoted threat to police officers.  The appearance of the Jammal Longmire rumor coincided with a then-ongoing controversy over police treatment of a young black girl at a pool party in McKinney, Texas, and most likely the image was created and/or garnered more attention due to what was at the time an ongoing race-related national debate.  Purported screen captures of the post were shared to multiple social networks, with the original appearing to bear a date stamp of 8 June 2015. A version published to Facebook on 10 June 2015 was shared hundreds of thousands of times, and an 11 June 2015 tweet held that “Jammal Longmire” was an “outspoken Black Lives Matter activist” (a claim that apparently did not bear out, as we were unable to find a person of that name or likeness affiliated with the movement):    Outspoken #BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops #BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb — Dr. White (@RealDoctorWhite) June 10, 2015  The image certainly agitated social media users in a time of racial disharmony, and in subsequent months it continued to spread. Yet apparently no trace of any Jammal Longmire existed on the Internet before the rumor became popular: if Longmire was an actual young man (and prominent Black Lives Matter activist) living in America, he maintained a highly atypical non-existent profile on social media and the Internet at large. Some folks speculated that Longmire concealed his accounts from view after the post went viral, but those subsequent actions couldn’t have retroactively eradicated all traces he would have left prior to 8 June 2015.  A search for Jammal Longmire restricted to items appearing before 8 June 2015 turns up only misdated references posted after the emergence of the rumor, and we were unable to locate any other evidence pertaining to the existence of a person by that name prior to then. Not only did Longmire seem to spring into existence with a controversial claim on 8 June 2015, but the words “Jammal” and “Longmire” didn’t appear consecutively at all on the Internet before that time.  It’s possible (though rather implausible) Longmire simply created a social media presence to post the image and make the threat and then disappeared back into the ether. However, national law enforcement agencies and Daytona Beach police treated reports about the post very seriously yet failed to to locate anyone remotely matching the name or photograph seen in the viral post. (It should be noted that Orlando television station WFTV described the post as belonging to Jammal Longmire but clearly did not verify whether such an individual existed.)  FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are conducting a joint investigation into a Facebook post. Officials say the post could be fake, but Chief Mike Chitwood said he received more than 500 emails about the threats. “We have opened a joint investigation with the FBI, the ATF and the border patrol (Border Patrol?) to try and see who is behind these postings,” Chitwood said. The post, belonging to Jammal Longmire, calls for people to pick up guns and kill police officers, police said. Police said the man in the picture is holding two assault rifles. “Is this really an attack on the officers? Is this person on that Facebook really who they say they are? So that’s what the investigation is trying to show out,” Chitwood said. “Look what happened in New York City,” Chitwood said. “I mean, you have a guy coming from Atlanta that is a little unstable, gets his hand on a couple guns, doesn’t have anything to lose, so I’m just going to go up and assassinate two police officers.” Authorities said Facebook has been served a warrant for the address of the device used to make the threats.  None of the listed agencies turned up a Jammal Longmire in Daytona Beach or anywhere else. A Longmire family was located in Michigan but was deemed to be unrelated to the man in the controversial photographs. Similarly, the educational institution whose name appeared on the shirt worn by the man in the photographs (North Carolina A&T State University) was unable to find him:    This has been investigated internally and determined that he is not one of our students. https://t.co/xNPd7BPn3b — North Carolina A&T (@ncatsuaggies) June 16, 2015  Some viewers observed that the firearms seen in the photograph were clearly corded as something being handled in a retail environment, some speculated they were attached to a video game, and others said they were secured in a fashion typically seen in gun stores. Regardless, the guns visible in the photograph clearly didn’t belong to the individual holding them and may not even have been operational.    So while Jammal Longmire has remained a focus of social media outrage since June 2015, neither local police, the FBI, nor the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) were able to locate him or his corded guns. The Longmire rumor or hoax was virtually identical to a similar racial controversy-based prank concerning a fictitious McDonald’s employee named Bubba Conroy who purportedly spat in white customer’s meals. That claim also generated significant measures of outrage on social media sites but did not hold up under scrutiny.  Last updated: 2 September 2015  Originally published: 2 September 2015"
1,"Anonymous hacktivists are planning to reveal the identities of 1,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) on the first anniversary of the Ferguson protests which erupted on 24 November 2014. Operation KKK, or #OpKKK, will also aim to shut down websites and other social media accounts affiliated with the KKK.  The on-going battle between the KKK and Anonymous began during the protests in Ferguson which erupted in the wake of a grand jury decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson for killing unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. During the protests a local chapter of the KKK – known as the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (TAKKKK) – warned protesters that ""lethal force"" would be used against them.  In response to this threat, Anonymous took control of the KKK's main Twitter account and published personal information regarding some alleged members of the TAKKKK. The amorphous group also alleged that it had evidence of a connection between the Ferguson police department and the TAKKKK.  We've gained access to yet another KKK Twitter account. Using the info obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 klan member identities. — Operation KKK (@Operation_KKK) October 22, 2015  Following the Anonymous operation, several members of the KKK reportedly left the group after having their identities exposed. Ahead of the anniversary of the Ferguson protests, a faction of Anonymous has now threatened to reveal the identities of more KKK members.  ""We are not attacking you because of what you believe in as we fight for freedom of speech,"" Anonymous said in a statement released last week. ""We are attacking you because of what you do to our brothers and sisters.  ""Due to your actions we will be rearranging Operation KKK. We've gained access to yet another one of your KKK Twitter account. Using the info obtained, we will be revealing about 1000 of your klan member identities. The aim of the operation is nothing more than cyber Warfare. Anything you upload will be taken down, anything you use to promote the KKK will be shut down."""
1,"Kim Davis, the county clerk who refused to sign same sex marriage licenses in the name of God, is feeling the wrath of the judicial system ... because she's in jail for contempt of court.  Federal Judge David L. Bunning ruled Thursday Davis was breaking the law by refusing to sign off on same sex marriage certificates simply because it went against her religious beliefs.  Davis, a devout Apostolic Christian, believes marriage should be between one man and one woman. She stopped giving out same sex marriage licenses in her county even after it became legal in Kentucky.  Judge Bunning said Davis' explanation for disobeying the law was ""simply insufficient."""
