0,"Michael Bublé has officially retired from music following his son Noah's cancer battle.  The singer, 43, explained that the heartache he endured following son's cancer diagnosis at just three years old has changed his 'perception of life' and he is now done with fame.  Noah, now five, is currently in remission following his battle with liver cancer, but the ordeal has been life-changing for Bublé, who has since questioned his career in showbusiness.  Michael Bublé reveals he has decided to quit the music industry following his son's battle with cancer  Michael is married to Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, 31, and they share three children together; their eldest son Noah, son Elias, two, and daughter Vida, whom they welcomed two months ago.  Both he and Luisana put their careers on hold to be there for their son - they jetted to the US so Noah could undergo treatment for hepatoblastoma.  The singer recalled how he used to make the 'best of the situation' during his hospital visits with Noah and tried to make it fun for his little boy.  Noah (pictured) now five, is currently in remission but Bublé says the ordeal has been life changing  With a new album, titled Love, on the way, he explained that this is his time to step away from music, wanting to leave at the 'very top' after making the 'perfect record'.  Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his 'last interview' with Daily Mail's Weekend magazine...  'My whole being’s changed since my son got cancer': Michael Bublé says he was embarrassed to realise just how egotistical he’d become as he nursed his boy Noah back to health - but now he's got his mojo back  By Chrissy Iley for Weekend Magazine  Michael Bublé knows better than most that fate does not stand aside and wave the famous through.  The Canadian singer has won four Grammys and sold 75 million records, earning him some £35 million a year.  Bublé opened up about the turmoil he and his family went through after his son Noah (pictured together) was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago  He’s been married to stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato for seven years, and the couple live a life of luxury with their three children, sons Noah, five, and Elias, two, and daughter Vida Amber Betty, who’s just 11 weeks old.  Yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago, and the devastated couple immediately announced they were putting their careers on hold to care for their son.  Noah has now been declared cancer-free and today Michael is looking suave and slim when we meet in his London hotel suite. He has a new album out, Love – but it’s one that he admits now might never have been made.  He’s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it’s clear he’s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.  ‘You just want to die,’ he says. ‘I don’t even know how I was breathing.  'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn’t strong. My wife was... I’m sorry, I can’t make it to the end of the sentence... let’s just say we find out who we are with these things.  Michael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear  'Going through this with Noah, I didn’t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?  'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.’  He says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni’s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni’s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.  ‘I don’t know if that was a choice, but that’s who I became,’ he says. ‘For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.  The singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did  'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I’d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.  ‘It’s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it’s not my story to tell, it’s his.  'But my whole being’s changed. My perception of life. I don’t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I’ve never lost control of my emotions in public.’  Michael likes to be in control and doesn’t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  As a teenager he’d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he’d emulate them. ‘In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,’ he says.  ‘I actually thought I’d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.  'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.  'Everyone recognises me and says, “How’s your son?” When you think you’re close to getting over it you’re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.  Michael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis  'The media helped me, they weren’t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, “We love you and we’re praying for you.”’  I was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. ‘I had no interest in my career and I’m grateful I could afford to take time out,’ he says.  ‘I spent a good deal of time with people who weren’t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn’t having fun in the music business.  'I’d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I’d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.  'I’d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I’d been having fun. I’d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.’  He grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. ‘I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.  I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have  'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I’d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.  'And I decided I’d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I’d never use social media again, and I never have.  ‘I realised that for many years I couldn’t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn’t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I’d be saying things like, “It’s hard to get here, but my God it’s harder to stay here.”  'But then I woke up and thought, “After ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.”’  It seems that his son’s illness ignited this realisation that he’d become fixated on his own success. ‘I don’t have the stomach for it any more,’ he says.  ‘The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.  'I’d forgotten that it’s about souls connecting, because I’d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, “If you hadn’t done this or that, or you’d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.”  'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.  'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, “It’s my fault. I’m absolutely rubbish.”  'It affected me and I started to think, “It’s all going to go. I’m going to lose everything.”  ‘I was insecure. I’d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I’d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.  'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I’m not a mere photocopy. I’ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.  'It needed clarifying. Now I’m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that’s when it comes back to you. Like love.’  Michael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.  Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart  He blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn’t careful) and started going to the gym.  He was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.  They met again at a party and he told her, ‘You’re my wife, you just don’t know it yet. I’m going to come back and marry you.’  A year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, ‘I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father’s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.’  When he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael’s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?  ‘The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn’t as straightforward as, “My son’s recovered, I should make an album,”’ he explains. ‘I’d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.  After that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018  'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, “Come over to the house, let’s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.”  They came over, we partied and we said, “Let’s play some music.” I thought, “Wow! This is fun.”’  He takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. ‘It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago.’  He’s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents – we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.  It was then that I realised I’d missed making music. I didn’t even know I’d missed it. This was about a year ago  He’s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. ‘We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he’s in my house “all the day”, as my little boy would say.’  He pauses. ‘There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,’ he says.  ‘One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.  'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending – not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up – there’s never a better time for music.’  Then suddenly he stops. ‘This is my last interview,’ he says quite solemnly. ‘I’m retiring from the business. I’ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.’  Somehow, though, I don’t think he really means it.  Michael’s album Love will be released on 16 November.

The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:"
0,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Chris Pine doesn’t see the big deal about being nude onscreen in “Outlaw King” and nearly naked in “Wonder Woman.”  “I bear the full monty [in ‘Outlaw King’] and it got a lot of attention,” Pine, 38, said on “The Graham Norton Show” on Friday. “I thought the witty reviews were brilliant, but what did strike me most is that Florence Pugh bares everything too and no one commented.”  “I am not sure what that means,” he admitted. “Either people think they can’t comment or everyone expects women to get naked. Either way, it’s double standards.”  “Outlaw King” director David McKenzie griped to Metro about the hype around Pine’s penis.  “It’s a man getting clean in a cold [lake] — you don’t do that with your clothes on,” McKenzie said. “And it’s microseconds. It’s ridiculous all the fuss about it.”  Pine previously said his nearly-nude scene in “Wonder Woman” inspired him to work out.  “I was excited,” he said of playing a naked Steve Trevor in the hit DC film. “I was like, ‘All right, man. Now the gauntlet is thrown. I’ve got something to prep for.’ It’s a 40-foot screen. If people are laughing at you doing push-ups on the set on the day, I don’t really care, because I’m going to be in Slovakia. I’ve got to prep for the Slovakians.”  He also said he didn’t mind being “objectified” by audiences of the Gal Gadot star vehicle.  “It was fun to be objectified for a day,” Pine told “Entertainment Tonight” in May 2017. “I was thinking this happens to women so, so much, it’s about time. While that was fun, I think it’s the most compassionate I’ve felt toward women on what they may feel being sidelined or made to feel less important.”"

0,"""She loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia,"" the actress recalled.  Amongst the many celebrities that we lost in 2016 was Carrie Fisher, whose portrayal of a brave rebel princess was equally as important as her interest in advocating for mental health awareness as well as women's rights. Now, Star Wars is honoring the legendary actress with a series of moving tributes created for the Star Wars Celebration event held in Orlando, Florida, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of A New Hope.  Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter, made a surprise appearance at the gala. Following George Lucas' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.  ""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""  Billie concluded her speech by reciting Leia's legendary plea to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The official Star Wars twitter account also posted this moving video homage to Carrie:  It was recently revealed that the late actress would, in fact, make a a posthumous appearance in Star Wars Episode IX: The Last Jedi, after her family gave Lucasfilm permission to use footage shot before her death. Episode IX will debut in theaters on May 23rd, 2019."

0,"Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak and her daughter Brielle Biermann are causing quite the stir on social media this week.  Early on Wednesday — five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat — the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.  “OMG!!! i’m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, “in the spring sometime.”  Brielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: “OMG!!! i can’t wait to meet the little nugget. it’s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.”  A few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. “Brielle’s lying!” she said. “She’s lying!”  But it’s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.  “I would love to have another little boy,” she told Us. “I am just obsessed with my boys.” The Don’t Be Tardy star added: “I’m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we’re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.”  And during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. “I have baby fever so bad,” she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: “Never say never.”  Meanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “The private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,” she wrote. “But I accidentally sent it to everyone.”  Zolciak also wants the world to know she didn’t confirm Khloé’ Kardashian’s pregnancy.  “The conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,” Zolciak said. “Everyone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.”"

After meeting at university, the pair were close pals for more than a year and lived in a shared house together before romance finally blossomed.  When asked about the moment they first laid eyes on each other, William said he would have to ""wrack his brains"" to remember it.  But Kate on the other hand remembers the moment perfectly, and it's fair to say it understandably probably wasn't her most cool and collected moment.  (Image: PA)  During the couple's engagement interview back in 2010 she recalled the moment she first saw her future husband.  She said: ""I actually went bright red when I met you and scuttled off feeling very shy about meeting you.  ""William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there from Fresher's Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other.  ""But we did become very close friends from quite early on.""  How sweet!  (Image: Getty Images Europe) (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  There were many rumours flying around at the time that Kate had a poster of the Prince on her wall - but she quickly corrected them.  She said: ""He wishes. I had the Levi guy on my wall, not a picture of William.""  Sorry Wills.  In the interview the duke and duchess also spoke about their brief split , and explained why it was so important to their relationship.  William said: ""We did split up for a bit.  ""We were both very young, it was at university and we were both finding ourselves and being different characters and stuff.  ""It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""It was just a bit of space. It worked out for the better.""  Kate admitted she wasn't happy about the break-up at the time, but in hindsight believes it was a good idea.  She said: ""At the time I wasn't very happy about it but actually it made me a stronger person.""  (Image: Tim Graham Photo Library)  ""You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised.  ""I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger.  ""I really valued that time, for me as well, although i didn't think it at the time."""
0,"The 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea officially kicked off on Friday, Feb. 9 with a highly-anticipated opening ceremony.  The Olympics opening ceremony, which had a theme of peace, featured K-pop (several countries marched out to BTS, and Team USA marched out to “Gangnam Style“), heated patriotic uniforms and some very cold temperatures.  Days before the event, organizers were working to stop a norovirus outbreak from spreading, ensure spectators and performers were equipped to endure freezing temperatures, and avoid exacerbating tensions among world leaders in attendance, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  Here are the key details to know about the Olympics opening ceremony:  What time did the 2018 Olympics opening ceremony start?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in PyeongChang on Feb. 9, beginning at 8 p.m. local time (6 a.m. EST).  The official Winter Olympic Games schedule began Thursday, with curling and ski jumping events starting on Feb. 8.  How can I watch the Olympics opening ceremony?  Early-bird Olympic enthusiasts in the United States were able to watch the opening ceremony live beginning at 6 a.m. EST on NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app, which is available on streaming devices, including Roku, Amazon Fire and Apple TV. Later on Friday at 8 p.m. EST, NBC will air a “fully-produced” television broadcast of the opening ceremony, featuring interviews and commentary by hosts Katie Couric and Mike Tirico.  Where was the opening ceremony held?  The Olympics opening ceremony took place in the new PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, which seats 35,000 people. The venue will be used just four times — for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Olympics and Paralympics — before being torn down. Construction of the stadium was part of the roughly $13 billion that South Korea is spending on the Olympics, the Associated Press reported.  But amid severe winter weather warnings, organizers feared that the Olympic stadium, which has no roof, might make the opening ceremony too cold for spectators to endure. Temperatures in PyeongChang this month have been falling to -4 degrees Fahrenheit at night, Reuters reported.  The forecast prompted organizers to work on measures to prevent cases of hypothermia and prepare for no-shows. Spectators were given hot packs, seat warmers, blankets, hats and windbreakers to keep warm. But temperatures at the opening ceremony were warmer than expected at 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and some athletes appeared unfazed.  What happened at the Olympics opening ceremony?  As in every Olympics opening ceremony since 1908, athletes marched into the stadium under their country’s flag during the Parade of Nations. Olympic athletes from North and South Korea marched together under a single flag — a historic diplomatic decision that caused some controversy.  Even before North and South Korea agreed to unite, organizers had planned for the Olympics opening ceremony to have a theme of peace. Korean musicians performed John Lennon’s “Imagine,” surrounded by lights in the shape of a dove.  “We have worked on all of our scenarios under the theme of peace,” Song Seung-whan, the executive creative director for the opening ceremony, said at a press conference in January, according to Reuters. “Although North Korea’s participation was decided belatedly, we think this will serve as a good opportunity for us to convey our message more clearly.”  More than a thousand drones lit up the sky in the shape of the Olympics rings, above a show that featured 1,300 performers and 700 volunteers at one point, the New York Times reported. South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim lit the Olympic cauldron after performing a short skating routine.  Pita Taufatofua — the oiled-up Tongan flag-bearer who became a social media sensation during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics — is competing in PyeongChang as a cross-country skier. He carried his country’s flag at Friday’s opening ceremony, stealing the show once again with the same shirtless uniform despite freezing temperatures.  Team USA weathered those bitter temperatures by wearing heated parkas as they paraded into the Olympic stadium. The uniforms, which feature American flags made of heat-conductive ink, were designed by Polo Ralph Lauren, the official outfitter for the 2018 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams.  Who attended the opening ceremony?  The U.S. delegation to the Olympics is led by Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the opening ceremony with his wife, Karen Pence. The delegation also includes California Rep. Ed Royce and 2002 Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes. Joining them are Gen. Vincent Brooks, who commands the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea; his predecessor, Gen. James Thurman; and Marc Knapper, a diplomat currently leading the U.S. embassy in Seoul.  Earlier in the day, Pence met with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier — the father of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea. Fred Warmbier had also been scheduled to attend the opening ceremony as Pence’s guest, the Washington Post reported. The Warmbiers attended this year’s State of the Union address by President Trump, who pointed to them as “powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world.”  Kim Jong Un sent his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, to the opening ceremony as part of the North Korean delegation, which is led by Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea’s parliament. The unprecedented visit marked the first time an immediate member of the Kim family has been to South Korea. It’s not clear if any of the North Korean representatives will meet Pence or other U.S. officials at the Olympics, though they were seated near each other at the opening ceremony. “We’ll have to see what happens,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said when asked about it on Monday, according to Reuters.  Meanwhile, President Trump and Kim Jong Un were represented at the opening ceremony by two impersonators in the stands, who caused a stir and were asked to leave.

0,"The daughter of one of the most fashionable forces to be reckoned with would naturally have a pretty eye-catching engagement ring — and Bee Shaffer did not disappoint when she debuted her rock on the red carpet on Monday night.  The 29-year-old daughter recently got engaged to 34-year-old Francesco Carrozzini — who, as the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, is also fashion family royalty — and the lovebirds made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala.  Bee certainly looked stunning in her silk Alexander McQueen floor-sweeper, which featured a patchwork of painted designs — but it was her bling that was the most noteworthy item of her ensemble.  Rockin' that rock! Bee Shaffer showed off her engagement ring on the red carpet for the first time on Monday night  In love: The 29-year-old also made her red carpet debut with her fiancé, Francesco Carrozzini  Lover here! Though her necklace and earrings were undoubtedly pricey, it was her diamond - encircled by smaller diamonds and set in yellow gown - that was the most eye-catching  Striking: She wore a patchwork Alexander McQueen number for the occasion  The public first found out that Bee was engaged in March, thanks to an Instagram photo that offered viewers a glimpse at the ring.  Shared in her friend Selby Drummond's Instagram Story, the black-and-white snap showed Bee trying on some shoes in what appears to be a fashion closet at Vogue, and added the hashtag #francescoblackandwhite — a hashtag Francesco uses often on his own Instagram.  Eagle-eyed 'grammers caught the flash of diamond in the snap, at Vogue later confirmed the news.  Now, a month and a half later, the duo has gone totally public, walking together on the red carpet at the Met Gala.  Love-dovey: Her husband-to-bee, Francesco, kept her close as they posed for the camera  Surprise! The two got engaged earlier this year and had been secretly dating for a while  Offspring: Francesco is the son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Carrozzini  Francesco, in a blue tux, kept his wife to be close with hand around her waist as they face the photographers. Bee, meanwhile, occasionally posed with her left hand on her hip, offering the cameras an obscured look at her diamond.  The ring features an unusually think, flat yellow gold setting and a large, round center stone, which is surrounded by 14 smaller stones.  Whether the ring is by a famous jeweler or a family heirloom is as yet unknown.  Basking in their first appearance since agreeing to get hitched, the couple walked the carpet toward the Wintour Costume Center, which was re-named after the Vogue editrix in 2014.  Iconic: Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour opted for a multi-textured dress that featured sequins, fur and embroidery  All hail: The Met Gala chair dazzled in her gown as her daughter took the carpet with Francesco  Bee's mom Anna, meanwhile, wore a custom Chanel dress covered in glitzy sequins. As is her habit, the host eschewed the theme — Rei Kawakubo/Commes Des Garcons: Art of the In-Between — and stuck to her signature classic, feminine style.  She finished off her look with a chunky necklace, a pretty pink lip, and her trademark sleek bob — choosing, wisely, to leave her infamous dark sunglasses at home for the ritzy occasion.  Bee and her husband-to-be were first linked just last year, soon before his mother, Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, passed away in December following a year-long illness.  Stunning: Bee made quite the impression as she showed off the long train of her dress on the stairs leading up to the gala event  Whoops! News of their engagement was made public in March when a friend shared this picture of Bee - and her ring - on her Instagram story  Franca, who died before Christmas at the age of 66, had edited Italian Vogue since 1988, taking up the position in the same month that Anna took over Vogue in the US.  Anna wrote a heartfelt letter of remembrance after Franca's passing, saying of her friend: 'Franca was warm, clever, funny, and someone who could give the Sphinx a run for its money when it comes to keeping a confidence.  'She was also the hardest-working person I have known, and with an envy-inducing ease with multitasking.'"

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Elon and I had a beautiful relationship, and we have a beautiful friendship now, one that was based on our core values,” she said.  As for what drew the two together, the actress said the two bonded over “intellectual curiosity, ideas and conversation, a shared love for science.”  “We just bonded on a lot of things that speak to who I am on the inside,” Heard explained. “I have so much respect for him.”  While the two remain good friends, Heard shared a bit of insight at the Tesla CEO’s meltdowns, saying, “He’s not boring.”  amber-heard Amber Heard and Elon Musk | Credit: Media-Mode/Splash News  Heard and Musk were first linked together in 2016 as each was weathering a public breakup: Heard and Johnny Depp finalized their divorce in January, while Musk filed for divorce from Westworld actress Talulah Riley in early 2015.  The two first broke up in August 2017 due to their busy schedules but rekindled their romance in January 2018 only to split for a second time a month later.  “Elon decided it was time to end it and Amber agreed,” a source close to the couple told PEOPLE at the time. “They both still care deeply for each other but the timing wasn’t right.”  Despite ending things in August, they were spotted out together in Australia just days after news of their split emerged.  “Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think,” Musk told Rolling Stone in a story published three months later. “I was really in love, and it hurt bad.”  RELATED VIDEO: Elon Musk’s Estranged Father Had a Baby with His Stepdaughter  Musk also said that he “cannot be happy” without a girlfriend.  “‘I never want to be alone.’ That’s what I would say,” he explained. “I don’t want to be alone.”  Despite having a successful career, he said his life feels empty without someone to share it with."
0,"Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. “I’m sorry you feel that way … I thought it turned out incredible,” he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The “race” constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark’s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than César Cielo’s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.  Regardless of Phelps’ abilities, Discovery’s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers’ sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:  Turns out “Michael Phelps races a shark” was really just “Michael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark’s time.” — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017  Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB — Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017  Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform — Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017  “All the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn’t a side by side race,” said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. “During Michael’s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‘Phelps vs. Shark,’ this message was clear.”  Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. “I’m sorry you feel that way … It’s hard to swim in a cage when you’re next to a shark … It wouldn’t be able to move at the right speed. So how we did it was the best way that we could do it.”  While the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of great white sharks (just check out this GIF of Phelps reacting to how easily a great white would win gold). Even though Phelps lost by a hair in this would-be race, to Phelps’ credit, he could take down a reef shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds.  “Rematch?” Phelps tweeted after “losing” to the ocean predator. But the real question: would anyone bother to watch?"

On Friday, Taylor deleted all previous posts and her profile pictures from her Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  Even Taylor’s website was a blank space!  Now she’s posted a 10 second dark video with no audio of what looks like an animal’s tail.  What does it all mean? Another album? We're not sure yet but it's certainly whipped fans into a frenzy!  Taylor has avoided the public eye ever since her spat with Kanye West and break up with British actor Tom Hiddleston.  Swift’s last album was 2014’s ‘1989’, her last single was her ‘I Don’t Wanna Live Forever’ collab with ZAYN in January for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack."

Former “Once Upon a Time” stars Jennifer Morrison, Ginner Goodwin, Josh Dallas, and Emilie de Ravin have all been confirmed to return for the show’s final episode, which is set to air on May 18.  All four of the actors departed the ABC fairy tale series after its sixth season. Morrison played Emma Swan in the series, while Goodwin played Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. Dallas starred as Prince Charming/David Nolan, and de Ravin played Belle/Lacey.  The four are the latest former cast members to book returns for the show’s finale. Previously, Tony Amendola, Lee Arenberg, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Robbie Kay, Sean Maguire, Victoria Smurfit, Keegan Tracy, Beverley Elliott, and Jared Gilmore were all confirmed to appear in the final two episodes.  ABC announced in February that “Once Upon a Time’s” seventh season would be the show’s last. The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season. The show also moved from its longtime Sunday night timeslot to Fridays, where it has suffered a noticeable ratings decline. Season 7 is currently averaging a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers, down over 40% in the demo and over 20% in total viewers from Season 6."

Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.  Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?  The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.  “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”  He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”  “There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  Valid point, Mr. Theroux.

0,"“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.  One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.  The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”"
0,"Photography via Getty  Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010. But it wasn’t until January 2011 that the pop stars confirmed their romance, namely by partaking in major PDA while on vacation together in St. Lucia.  Photography by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  February 2011: Jelena steps out on red carpet at the Vanity Fair Oscars party  Yup, they finally made our dreams a reality by walking the red carpet together for the first time, thus confirming their young love. Aren’t they adorable?  photography by Kevin Mazur/Contributor/Getty  May 2011: Billboard Music Awards  Jelena looked happy and strong at the Billboard Music Awards. Oh, young love.  photography by steve granitz/contributor/getty  November 2011: Jelena is over… apparently  Rumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there’s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.  photography via instagram.com/ashilrd  January 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber  They clearly can’t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram… and of course, promptly deleted it.  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  November 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards  The singer took to the stage to perform her single, “The Heart Wants What It Wants.” Here’s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they’d split.  photography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin    December 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours  Jelena, what? We’re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).  photography via instagram.com/zedd  January 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin  Shortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.  photography via instagram.com/selenamylight  September 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE  Gomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.  photography via instagram.com/selgselgenator  November 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  In November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena—thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs? Check out “What Do You Mean?” “Sorry” and “Mark My Words”.  photography via instagram.com/haileybaldwin  January 2016: Bieber and Baldwin hang out on New Year’s Eve  Was it not recently that JB confirmed that he and Baldwin were just good friends? Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — shooters for krisdeana (@belizafucked) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber ? #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  ?| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — ? (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best."

A new lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses the entrepreneur of rape, according to reports from The New York Times and Billboard. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.  Per the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.

0,"American attorney and businessman  This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (October 27, 1917 – December 9, 2012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (July 15, 1917 – May 21, 2008), both Armenian Americans.[1] He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas ""Tom"" Kardashian.[2][3] The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire.[4] Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.  He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived on 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue.[5] Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Simpson was the best man at Robert Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978. Robert was the water boy for the USC Trojans football team which would be ranked #1 in the nation in the AP Poll.[citation needed]  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense ""Dream Team"", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: ""I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.""[16] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at age 59,[18] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[19]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[20]  Personal life  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Rob.[21]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[22][23][24] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children ""were instrumental"" in the demise of the relationship.[25][26][27] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (née Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[28][17]  See also"
0,"Abby Lee Miller has a new projected release date from the Victorville, California prison — almost one full month earlier than when she was initially scheduled to be released — according to the Bureau of Prisons.  The 52-year-old former Dance Moms star was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison in May 2017 for bankruptcy fraud. However, due to good behavior, her initial release date of June 21 has been moved up. Her new date is now projected to be May 25, which “includes credit for good conduct time that may be earned throughout the remainder of her sentence,” the bureau told Us Weekly on Friday, March 16.  Us Weekly caught up with former mentee of Miller’s, Nia Sioux, at the Midnight Sun premiere on Thursday, March 15, who dished on leaving her former Dance Moms life behind. “Probably not,” Sioux told Us about the possibility of reconnecting with Miller post-jail. “Never say never, but I’ve pretty much distanced myself for a while.”  The 16-year-old dancer did, however, reveal that she “really learned so much from” Miller. She added: “I think one thing that I take from working with her is I learned how to deal with difficult people, with different types of people.”  As previously reported, the reality star was also sentenced for not reporting the $120,000 worth of Australian currency that she had brought into the United States. Along with prison time, she was fined $40,000 along with a $120,000 judgment, and ordered to two years of supervised release.  In December 2017, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that the Abby Lee Dance Company owner had completed a prison Release Preparation Program as well as received a certificate in personal finance."
0,"It’s complicated for Teen Mom 2’s Kailyn Lowry. The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn’t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child’s father is Chris Lopez.)  The 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac’s life— she doesn’t feel it’s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.  “I don’t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln’s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don’t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,” the mom shared with Radar.  And while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.  “I didn’t ask how he was handling it,” she explained to the outlet. “But he did say congratulations.”  Making things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn’t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.  Attorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry’s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: “Delaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.”  In order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to “discharge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.”  The pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.  But the MTV star doesn’t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. “Javi is not the father,” she explained to Radar. “Chris is the father so I think we’re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that’s established.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page."

Her repeated donation under Pence’s name is not a “prank,” she said, but a way to peacefully protest while supporting the organization.  ""I don't look at it as a prank,"" Kunis said. ""I literally -- I strongly disagree -- and this is my little way of showing it. It's a peaceful protest.""  Before she went into detail about her donations, the former “That 70s Show” star told Conan that she might get “a lot of hate mail” and she apologized if her actions offended anyone.  ""It's not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do,"" Kunis said.  ""So as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.""  This was met with loud applause from the audience.  ""Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says, 'an anonymous donation has been made in your name,'"" Kunis said."

Matt Lauer and his model wife Annette Roque were recently spotted spending some time with their daughter, 14-year-old Romy, in a horse farm in New York. which definitely contrasts the speculations that the two are mere moments away from a divorce. Both Lauer and Roque were seen and photographed at Bright Side Farm, a horse training facility that they had opened in 2013. However, while the couple did spend a lot of time there, they arrived separately, with Roque, who was without a wedding ring, arriving first. Both had been there to watch as their daughter rode through the farm.  Their sons Jack and Thijs were visibly absent from the trip, but Lauer would, later on, be seen spending time with them in the Hamptons.  When Lauer was first fired from ""The Today Show,"" news quickly spread that he and his wife of 11 years were divorcing, as caused by the former news anchor's sexual misconduct scandal as well as his affairs with his co-workers. Lauer released a statement after his termination as well as an apology, saying: ""There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry... Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish deeply. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I am committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full-time job.""  A few days prior to their latest family outing, Annette Roque had been spotted leaving a New York law firm, which had everyone assuming that her agenda there had something to do with the end of her marriage to Lauer."

0,"When you've shopped for sunscreen , you have probably noticed products with very high sun protection factor (SPF) ratings.  But is a 100+ or a 90+ sunscreen really that much better than one with an SPF of 30?  SPF refers to the ability of a sunscreen to block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, which cause sunburns, but not UVA rays, which are more closely linked to deeper skin damage. Both UVA and UVB contribute to the risk of skin cancer.  The SPF rating is a measure of the time it would take you to sunburn if you were not wearing sunscreen as opposed to the time it would take with sunscreen on.  ""SPF is not a consumer-friendly number,"" says Florida dermatologist James M. Spencer, MD. ""It is logical for someone to think that an SPF of 30 is twice as good as an SPF of 15 and so on. But that is not how it works.""  According to Spencer, an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays.  ""After that, it just gets silly,"" he says.  Sunscreens with higher SPF ratings block slightly more UVB rays, but none offers 100% protection.  Spencer recommends SPF 30 products to his patients.  Farah Ahmed, who is general counsel for the cosmetics industry group Personal Care Products Council, concedes that the difference in sunburn protection between the medium- and high-SPF sunscreens is not great.  But, she says, the high SPF products may protect better against long-term skin damage and exposure-related skin cancers.  Whatever product you choose, experts recommend using a water-resistant sunscreen applied liberally one half hour before going outdoors. Sunscreen should be reapplied at least every two hours or after swimming, drying off, or sweating.  ""The best way make sure you are protected is to reapply sunscreen often,"" Spencer says. ""You just can't put it on in the morning and forget about it. I don't care if it's SPF 800 or the best UVA protection, after a few hours it's gone."""

1,"Erin Jensen  USA TODAY  Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.  “I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago. Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.  Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?  The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.  “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”  He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”  “There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”  Valid point, Mr. Theroux.

1,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.  “A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”  The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.  A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”  According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.  The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.  Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained."
1,"Fans believe Taylor Swift's single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" targets Kanye West. Larry Busacca/Getty Images The INSIDER Summary:  Kanye West fans are convinced Taylor Swift's album release date purposely coincides with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother's death.  In response to the date, Kanye fans took to the r/Kanye subreddit to plan ""Hey Mama"" day.  The plan is to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date in order to steal the potential top spot from Swift.  Around 2,200 fans have declared interest in the event so far.    Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released — it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.  Though Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, ""I made that b---h famous"" line on ""Famous,"" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.  The subreddit that started it all. Reddit  ""Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim's Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye's font and cover art style for her new album 'Reputation.' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye's mother, Donda West's death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor's songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.""  Not content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to ""Hey Mama"" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit . Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish.  The post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there's an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, ""Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day"" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just ""Hey Mama"" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around."
1,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports."
1,"I don't know who is more excited about Khloé's new baby: The Kardashian family or me. (Probably the family, but it might actually be a close call.) By now you've most definitely heard that on April 12, TMZ reported Khloé Kardashian gave birth to her daughter and wow, I feel so emotional just writing that. Don't judge... Kardashian babies just bring it out in me, OK? But now that Kardashian's baby has arrived, the world is so, so happy about it, and of course, the Kardashians' reactions to Khloé Kardashian's baby make me want to cry tears of pure joy. There is too much love, you guys.  UPDATE 2: Kim Kardashian also opened up about Khloé giving birth. She tweeted on April 13, ""@khloekardashian I’m so happy for you! Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy! I can’t wait for our baby girls to grow up as best friends the way we are! I’m so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL."" She also tweeted, ""You guys she’s so gorgeous!!!!!""  UPDATE 1: Kylie Jenner has also sent her congratulations to her big sister on the birth of her baby girl. Jenner posted a photo to Snapchat using a filter that read, ""Kongrats, Khloé! It's a girl!""  EARLIER: Before we dive into the Kardashian love-fest, let's go back to where it all began: That fateful day of Dec. 20, 2017, when Khloé Kardashian gave the world a Christmas miracle in the form of an Instagram post confirming her pregnancy.  She wrote,  My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love!  I will never *not* cry at this announcement, TBH.  As if she didn't do enough simply by sharing her pregnancy, she went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and discussed potential name ideas, though at the time, she had no clue whether she was having a boy or a girl. ""I think if it's a boy I'll go with Tristan Junior,"" she said, adding, ""For a girl I don't even know where to begin. I think I'll go with a K or a T name though.""  The video, which you can check out below, had me screaming:  God bless Khloé Kardashian.  We of course know Kardashian revealed her baby's sex on the season finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, telling her family and fans that she was expecting a little girl:  And then wrote the sweetest message on Twitter, feeling very fortunate to be having a little lady. She wrote,  I am now so excited my daughter will have forever best friends with Chicago and Stormi!! God is great!!! Thank you Lord for our princess  Fans loved seeing Kardashian's reaction about the reveal. Too sweet for words.  When reports first came out that Kardashian gave birth, the entire world collectively screamed and cried tears of joy. Many took to Twitter to express how excited they were.  But the most excited were obviously her siblings and her mom, Kris Jenner. Jenner posted a video of Kendall Jenner repeating the word ""baby,"" that was originally posted by W Magazine. The original caption read, ""When three of your sisters give birth in under a year. Congratulations to @KhloeKardashian on welcoming another girl to the KarJenner clan."" Jenner reposted it, writing, ""BLESSED!!!""  Kourtney Kardashian also posted an Instagram to her page that showed North West, Penelope Disick, and Tracy Romulus' daughter. The caption read, ""GIRL POWER."" This caption could be a tiny clue that Kourtney was celebrating the birth of Khloé's daughter and the sisterhood that is their family.  I am seriously swooning right now.  I love how all the Kardashians are so supportive of one another and so excited for all of the new arrivals in their family as of late (looking at you, Chicago West and Stormi Webster).  A big congratulations to Kardashian and the whole crew!"
1,"The British royal family is a very private bunch, so consequently speculation about their personal lives runs rampant. And now that Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews is approaching, gossip magazines (in particular, The Sun) are reporting that she has the royal equivalent of *beef* with Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle.  The specifics? Apparently, Markle won't be invited to Pippa's wedding thanks to a ""no ring, no bring"" policy—with a source noting, ""It's clear Pippa doesn't want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day.""  Pippa Middleton and James Matthews attend Wimbledon in 2016. Getty Images  Interestingly, Pippa's future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews is also reportedly not allowed to bring his girlfriend, reality television star Vogue Williams. ""Pippa's view is that Vogue's relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,"" the source says. ""But some people in the circle are pretty shocked because this is her future brother-in-law who's going to end up attending on his own. It's certainly raised eyebrows.""

1,"Getty  After another rough spell for the couple, and Miley recently admitting she doesn’t “envision” getting married anytime soon, it appears the power couple are about to call off their engagement for a second time.  A source told US magazine OK!: “When they got back together, Liam thought things would be different, but Miley hasn’t changed at all.  “She’s sobered up but she’s still immature and isn’t ready to commit to spending the rest of her life with one person.  “They do love each other but at this point it’s starting to become clear this relationship simply can’t go the distance.”  Miley and Liam are have tried couple’s therapy according to the magazine, but it hasn’t worked and only led to more fights. Liam is also said by friends to be envious of his brother, Chris, having three kids with his wife Elsa Pataky, but while he’s feeling more and more broody, Miley is not ready to commit to children and wants to focus on her career and having fun."
1,"The ongoing rumors about Brad Pitt and his ex-wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, continue to swirl regarding a supposed reconciliation between the former couple. The claims have only intensified ever since Jennifer Aniston and her husband of two years, actor Justin Theroux, called it quits recently.  While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to work their way through a very challenging time, involving their own divorce and custody battle over their six children, the pair has been constantly linked to various rumored new loves. Despite Pitt having been falsely linked to a list of beauties, Jennifer Aniston has remained the most frequent female celeb to be rumored as spending time with the heartthrob.  Now the focus is on how Angelina Jolie is reacting to the rumored reconciliation between Pitt and his former wife, Aniston. Reports swirl that Angelina and Jen are gearing up for a showdown over the Allied star and that Pitt is ""freaking out"" over the drama that his and Aniston's supposed closeness has resulted in.  New Idea shares alleged details relayed by a source on the lengthy love triangle between the three. The insider relays that Jen and Angelina have already spoken about the big night that will see the trio in the same room, along with anyone who's anyone in Hollywood and film. The three will all attend the Oscars and the women are said to have discussed boundaries for the occasion that could result in a ""showdown"" between Jen and Angelina.  ""Word is Jen and Angie had a major discussion about the Oscars. It's the biggest night of the year, and they know they'll both be party-hopping,"" the insider states. ""However, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, 'neither are willing to budge an inch,' resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other – something neither are very happy about,"" the publication continues.  The star ex-husband to both these talented beauties is reportedly quite stressed out about the potential words that will be exchanged at one of the entertainment industry's most formal and important events.  ""I heard he's frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs – no good could possibly come from it,"" the insider claims.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently announced their separation in a joint statement, within which the pair stated that they will carry on as friends and to not believe any stories that are making the rounds, reminding that what comes from them is the only truth.  This has not stopped fabrications from swirling. The rumors even now go so far as to say that Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux have met up to find comfort and plot against Jen and Brad over their said reconciliation. This, however, has been debunked and is not to be believed, as Gossip Cop has informed readers.  This latest claim is yet to be verified, and if there is tension between the trio, the stars will likely keep their personal matters out of the prestigious event on Sunday."
1,"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger."

1,"What’s the key to a successful marriage? A killer engagement ring, perhaps? Brides-to-be Miley Cyrus, Miranda Kerr, Serena Williams, and more were not shy about flaunting their bling!  Not to sound totally shallow, but isn’t the engagement ring just as important as the man giving it to you? In Sex & The City, Carrie Bradshaw actually THREW UP when she saw the hideous ring Aiden Shaw bought for her. That’s not exactly the best way to start the next chapter in your life. Ergo, there’s tons of pressure on dudes to buy the right diamond, the right cut, and the right band. Oh, and the right proposal plan. It may not be easy, but hunks like Liam Hemsworth, Evan Spiegel, and more totally nailed it with their girlfriends!  This year was FULL of romantic proposals! The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they’ll be headed down the alter. Of course we’re talking Miley Cyrus and Liam! Love is officially alive and well again now that these two are back together and head over heels. The “Malibu” singer has been mum about a wedding date, but we hope it’s in the near future!  While some engagements were to be expected, like Miranda Kerr and her CEO founder boyfriend, others were completely out of the blue! Lady Gaga is reportedly engaged to Christian Carino — and they’ve only been dating for about six months! We have not seen a diamond ring from Mother Monster yet, but we can’t wait to catch a first glimpse when she’s ready to share the amazing news with fans. Another big congratulations goes out to reality star Cardi B and rapper Migos, whose engagement news broke just a week ago. So many beautiful weddings to look forward to!  HollywoodLifers, did any of these engagements surprise you? Which proposal story do you think is the cutest?"

1,"Congratulations are in order for Miranda Kerr. The supermodel announced on Wednesday, November 15, that she is expecting a baby with her husband of six months, Evan Spiegel.  This will be the second child for the 34-year-old, who shares custody of son, Flynn, 6, with her ex-husband, Orlando Bloom.  “Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,” a spokesperson tells Us Weekly.  Kerr and the Snapchat founder, 27, were married at their home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood on May 27. They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom “Marry Me” Snapchat filter. “I said yes!!!” wrote the former Victoria’s Secret Angel on Instagram.  Despite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel’s maturity. “He’s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.’s] Venice,” she told The Edit in 2016. “He comes home early. We don’t go out. We’d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”  Kerr once said that parenting Flynn is “the most rewarding thing” she’s ever done. “It has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “Being a working mother is challenging because . . . I never want to leave him — but it’s important to teach your child the value of working.”"
1,"Despite what fans may have heard, Justin Theroux is still getting over his breakup from Jennifer Aniston, a source tells ET.  Rumors have been swirling this week that the 46-year-old actor-writer is dating Petra Collins after his Instagram followers took notice of a photo he posted of himself with the 25-year-old artist back in February. Theroux shared the pic on the same day he was photographed at the Adam Selman show during New York Fashion Week.  ""Justin is still heartbroken,"" a source tells ET, adding that Theroux is not one to play the field but rather prefers to be in a relationship and is still reeling over the fact that his marriage to Aniston did not work out.  Meanwhile, another source tells ET that the former Leftovers star has been relying on his friends to help him cope with the breakup, and notes that Theroux ""had a nice time"" during his ""guys' trip"" to Paris, France, earlier this month.  When abroad, the newly single star attended the Louis Vuitton runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and while his pals might have been eager to hit the town and flirt with women, Theroux was friendly rather than flirty, according to the source.  Getty Images  A third source tells ET that Theroux is, however, ready for ""his next phase in life.""  As for his relationship with Collins, the third source says the two met through Selena Gomez when ""they all hung out together.""  ""She is artsy and edgy and loves the New York nightlife,"" the source says of Collins before calling out that Gomez -- who's also friendly with Aniston -- recently unfollowed the artist on Instagram.  Despite his apparent heartbreak, the source says Theroux is confident that his breakup with the 49-year-old actress was the right decision as their relationship had been ""going south for a long time.""  “He felt confined by their relationship. He wasn't interested with Jen's everyday scheduled life of yoga classes, eating healthy,” the source continues. “Justin is a free spirit and loves his time alone. Justin had a need for independence.”  Reporting by Darla Murray and Adriane Schwartz.

1,"Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth on Her 63rd Birthday  Ken McKay/ITV/REX / Shutterstock.com  Ellen DeGeneres turned 63 on Jan. 26. On her special day this year, she hosted Inauguration poet sensation Amanda Gorman, was treated to a multicolor birthday cocktail created by chef José Andrés of World Central Kitchen, and shared her advice for celebrating a birthday during a pandemic.  The embattled world-famous talk show host typically dedicates an entire episode of her show to the special occasion — including gifts for her audience and cameos by iconic celebrity friends. But this year she addressed a virtual studio audience, promising a “do-over” for the pandemic birthday next year. “As soon as this thing is over, we get two birthdays,” she said. “That means two cakes and two presents per guest, and two hangovers.”  Those fortunate enough to be in the audience for DeGeneres’ birthday show in the past have received Netflix gift cards that covered five years of the subscription service, $300 Lyft rideshare service gift cards and a three-day, two-night stay at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess hotel.  DeGeneres is still struggling to bounce back from a rocky 2020, in which her show was dogged by allegations of a toxic work culture. She’s also only recently recovered from COVID-19, which she contracted in December 2020.  More From Your Money  Find Out: The Richest Celebrity From Every State  Ellen DeGeneres’ Net Worth: $370 Million  DeGeneres’ net worth is estimated to be roughly $370 million, according to Forbes (though by some estimates it’s as high as $500M). In 2020, DeGeneres made $84 million, retaining the No. 12 spot on Forbes’ list of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. Her wife — actress Portia de Rossi — has her own $50 million fortune, which brings the celebrity couple’s total net worth to $420 million.  Starting out as a stand-up comedian, DeGeneres rose to fame as an actress, starring in the TV series “Ellen” from 1994 to 1998 and “The Ellen Show” from 2001 to 2002. Her daytime talk show, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” debuted on Sept. 8, 2003, and had consistently high ratings until the recent controversies. Upon her return to the show in September, her season premier ratings dropped 29% from the previous season, Variety reported. In 2015, “The Ellen Show” won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. According to Celebrity Net Worth, DeGeneres receives an estimated annual salary of between $75 million and $90 million.  DeGeneres has hosted the Oscars twice, both in 2007 and in 2014. She made history during the 2014 gig by tweeting a group selfie with a gaggle of famous friends, including Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey — a photo that has received more than 3 million retweets since being posted.  DeGeneres famously voiced the character Dory in the 2003 Pixar films “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory.” She’s also found major success behind the camera with her own production company A Very Good Production.  Whoa: 50 Highest-Grossing Actors of All Time  Ellen DeGeneres’ Business Ventures  The tech-savvy superstar launched the site Ellentube in 2014, which hosts exclusive video content from her talk show. In 2015, she also partnered with Vessel to debut one or two clips from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on the streaming site before they’re available anywhere else.  DeGeneres has also ventured into the beauty and fashion world. In 2009, she became the face of COVERGIRL. She also previously served as the spokeswoman for JCPenney and American Express. And her lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen — including clothing, accessories and home decor — launched in 2015.  In late 2017, DeGeneres also debuted a new game show titled “Ellen’s Game of Games” on NBC, expanding the popular games which have been previously featured on her talk show.  More From Your Money  Big Tippers: 10 Celebs Who’ve Left Generous Tips  Ellen DeGeneres’ Real Estate Portfolio  DeGeneres and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 28-year-old.  The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. The couple also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.  In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — DeGeneres sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a California home in 2007 for $20 million, which was later the site of Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.  The total number of properties currently owned by the couple is unknown. DeGeneres released her interior design book “Home” in 2015, which included photos and design tips from many of their past and present residences. Their former Thousand Oaks, Calif. ranch — which they sold in 2013 for $10.85 million — was also previously featured in Elle Décor.  There’s Time: Samuel L. Jackson and 34 Other Celebrities Who Got Rich and Famous Later in Life  Ellen DeGeneres’ Honors and Awards  In November 2016, President Obama presented DeGeneres with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “It’s easy to forget now just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages 20 years ago,” Obama said.

The rapper, 48, who previously confessed to cheating on his wife, was asked about their relationship during an appearance on The Van Jones Show on CNN.  Asked about fighting for their relationship, he told the reporter: 'That's my soul mate. It's the person I love. You can be in love with someone, you can love someone, and if you haven't experienced love or don't understand it or you don't have the tools to move forward then you are going to have complications. Period.'  'We chose to fight for our love': Jay-Z has opened up about fighting for his marriage to his 'soul mate' Beyonce (pictured with daughter Blue Ivy in February 2017)  'You can either address or you can pretend until it blows up at some point. For us, we chose to fight for our love, for our family, to give our kids a different outcome, to break that cycle for black men and women, to see a different outcome.'  'We were never a celebrity couple,' he insisted. 'We were a couple who just happened to be celebrities.'  He added the best way to apologize was through 'changed behavior.'  'You have to acknowledge the pain. You have to let that person have their say. You have to get on the floor, get on the mattress, and you have to really work through it and really be honest no matter how many times.

1,"Miranda Lambert and Anderson East were pretty adorable during their two-year-long relationship. If PDA nauseates you, rumors of a breakup are the antacid you need. But if you love love? The dozens of photos, videos, onstage moments and ugga muggas they shared are a reminder of what it can be like to catch lightning in a bottle.  This timeline of Lambert and East's romance starts with a broken heart and might end with one, too, if you believe everything you read at the grocery store. The pile of sources confirming their breakup grows taller and taller, but neither singer has spoken up (they have stopped following each other on Instagram, and though Lambert still follows East on Twitter, he does not reciprocate). Quietly they loved on, until they didn't.  July 20, 2015 — Shock and heartbreak. Lambert and husband Blake Shelton get divorced, ending country music's highest-profile marriage after just four years.  Sept. 12, 2015 — Exactly when Lambert started dating East wasn't clear until she shared this photo two years into the relationship, celebrating Sept. 12 as an anniversary. That's 54 days after her divorce from Shelton. She references the song ""Pushin' Time,"" a song she would later confirm she wrote about East.  During a taping for PBS' Front and Center Lambert would later reveal that the song was actually inspired by an early argument. ""It was all lovey-dovey and then we got in a fight, ’cause that’s how it goes,"" she says. ""And I was pissed, ’cause that’s also how it goes. He tried to smooth it over with me. I said, ‘Are you going to break up with me?’ He said, ‘I think I’ll wait 60 years.’ So, sweet.""  Jan. 1, 2016 — After weeks of speculation, the couple go public with a New Year's Day photo of them cuddling together on a couch and the caption: ""The snuggle is real.""  Feb. 14, 2016 — During their two years together (and some change), one half of this couple would often storm the other's stage to sing a song or two. This Valentine's Day performance of ""Always Be My Baby"" (yes, the Mariah Carey hit) is the first documented time it happened. A Taste of Country News video also recalls how deep in it the country singer was. She wore a University of Alabama hat for him, which is saying something for a Texas girl!  April 2, 2016 — At the ACM Awards Lambert and East walk the red carpet for the very first time together. Her dress remains our favorite of her many glam looks. As for East, he'd only get one more shot on awards show carpet. In total, they hit six red carpets together.  July 17, 2016 — Lambert shares a photo of the couple kissing on Instagram with a caption that reads, ""Happy Birthday to my favorite 'Bama' boy!"" Photos of the two together were not rare by this point. East would also regularly Insta-flirt with his girlfriend of 10 months.  Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2016 — The couple walk the BMI Awards and CMA Awards red carpet together and looked great. ""I was the big winner last night,"" East would later say on Instagram.  A few days later, Lambert responded to trolls who criticized her appearance with a sharply-worded post on Instagram that quoted Maya Angelou: ""Cowardly people hiding behind a keyboard or a cell phone writing their useless comments about our eyes and clothes and body language. What a bunch of bull s--t.""  March 12, 2017 — Still dueting, still happy! East joins Lambert onstage during a Highway Vagabond Tour stop in Bossier, City, La., singing the Faces' ""Stay With Me."" The song is unabashedly sexual, and Lambert and East definitely play on that in their performance, turning in a flirtatious, touchy-feely performance that lets their real-life chemistry shine through.  April 1, 2017 — After the ACM Awards in Las Vegas, the pair share Instagram messages in reference to Lambert's Female Vocalist of the Year win. ""Couldn't be more proud of this little lady and the amazing art she brings with her,"" East says on Instagram. Lambert follows with this:  July 16, 2017 — One day before East's 30th birthday, Lambert grabs his microphone in New York and delivers a slow, sultry version of ""Happy Birthday."" The crowd joins in, and it's magical:  June 6-7, 2017 — Lambert and East make two appearances together at the 2017 CMA Music Festival, including her MuttNation March and the CMT Awards. Lambert then flies solo to the 2017 Taste of Country Music Festival.  Public appearances together slow after this. In fact, we found only one more.  Nov. 8, 2017 — At the 2017 CMAs, Lambert sparkles like a princess next to East in his usual black and white ensemble. The walk united and speak united after Garth Brooks lip syncs during his performance. First East blasted the Entertainer of the Year on Instagram, and she responded in the comments:  Instagram  January 12, 2018 — Lambert shares what seems to be the last public photo of the couple together, though she continues to like his photos on social media through February 18. They no longer follow each other on Instagram.  March 3, 2018 — Tabloids started reporting a breakup in February, but it was Lambert's comments during a March show in Knoxville, Tenn., that truly stir the pot.  ""I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes,"" she said, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. ""That's my favorite. And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one.""  Lambert's representatives did not respond to Taste of Country's request for comment at the time, and East's rep refused to talk about his personal life. Credit Us Weekly with reigniting the breakup rumors in April, citing ""many sources."" There is no new information."
1,"Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have moved on in their professional lives since they got separated last year but rumours about their personal lives keep swirling on the internet. A recent report claims that the A-list Hollywood actress is upset about the thought of her estranged husband dating another woman and keeps track of him through their common friends.  ""Angelina's hyper-aware of what Brad's up to, she's always trying to keep tabs on him. They still have friends in common and she quizzes them for info. She knows Brad's ready to start dating again,"" a source told Hollywood Life.  The report by the entertainment website claims that the 42-year-old Salt actress ""hates the idea"" of Pitt moving on in his life ""emotionally"". ""It's a hard pill for her to swallow and that's got her wanting to do the same. She's very competitive and hates the idea of him beating her to the punch. Plus it drives her crazy that he's emotionally moved on since she really hasn't.""  The actress is currently focussing on her family and was often spotted going out with her six children. Pitt, on the other hand, is having a busy filming schedule and is reportedly ready to date again. Recently, he has been linked with Ella Purnell, a British actress who is 32 years younger than him.  ""Right now Angelina's still not started dating but she has been getting closer to pulling the trigger. Hearing Brad is looking to date again made her feel motivated to find someone too. Even though her mind really isn't in that space she hates the idea of 'losing' to him. She's started forcing herself to open her eyes and look around and a few guys have caught her eye,"" the Hollywood Life source claimed."
1,"The Fifty Shades Darker press tour will begin soon, but fans might be disappointed as the lead actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have refused to promote the film, gossip websites say so.  Also Read: Are Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan expecting first child?  According to reports, Johnson and Dornan have refused to promote the film. Fans of the novel are of the opinion that Johnson and Dornan are ""horribly miscast"" for the lead actors' role – Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.  ""Fans should at least be seeing Jamie and Dakota out and about, if not talking to the press about the movie. Even paparazzi are having a hard time locating them,"" Celebs Dirty Laundry reported quoting sources.  According to reports, Dornan is trying to shed Christian Grey's image from the Fifty Shades franchise, as he is looking for different roles in Hollywood for months now. Dornan does not want his fans to remember him only for his role in the Fifty Shades franchise.  However, Gossip Cop has debunked the news and said that Dornan and Johnson are gearing up to promote the film, which is set for Valentine's Day release.  Fifty Shades Darker has been in the spotlight again for the wrong reasons. Earlier, the Celebs Dirty Laundry reported that critics are not happy with the sex scenes in the movie due to which Johnson and Dornan are forced to reshoot the scenes.  Critics who saw the film laughed off watching Johnson and Dornan's intimate scenes. Though Johnson and Dornan tried hard to maintain the chemistry, they could not perform up to the mark, thus making the second instalment film worse than the first part.  However, Gossip Cop also debunked this report as well. The website quoting sources reported that the makers have wrapped up the film and the lead pair is not shooting the sex scenes again."
1,"SELENA Gomez has become embroiled in the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie divorce, amid sensational claims a picture of her cosying up to the actor at the Golden Globes caused issues in his marriage.  The Sun reports the 24-year-old, who appeared briefly in the film The Big Short with Pitt, shared a picture of herself gazing into the dad-of-six’s eyes as they enjoyed a moment together at the start of this year. The photo was captioned: “just discussing #TheBigShort.”  At the time, the brunette singer made no secret of how attractive she found the 52-year-old, saying: “I’m not going to lie. It’s nice to look at all of the hot guys I admire. I’m trying to find Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt right now!”  However according to the National Enquirer, the image did not go down well with Pitt’s wife of two years.  “Angie blew a gasket when she saw Selena’s Instagram, and heard through friends about how brad and Selena flirted so shamelessly,” a source said.  The source continued: “Now Selena is bragging to everyone that Brad is gung ho to make another movie with her. Selena is going around jokingly calling Brad ‘my future husband’, and Angie is obviously none too pleased.”  According to the publication, Jolie demanded that Pitt didn’t work with the young star again. Gomez previously dated Justin Bieber and was linked to Orlando Bloom.  “Angie warned Brad to cut all ties with Selena, and she’s forbidding him from working with her again,” the source said.  A little tb and a happy birthday to one of the kindest people I know AND someone who has inspired me for years! A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Feb 11, 2016 at 6:25pm PST  Jolie filed for divorce from her partner of 12 years on Monday. Divorce papers show the Hollywood actress wants overall physical custody of their six children — not joint custody with Pitt — after citing irreconcilable differences.  RELATIONSHIP TIMELINE  It’s thought that numerous factors have contributed to her decision, including claims he grew too close to his Allied co-star Marion Cottilard and that his reported weed consumption and temper had got too much for her and she was concerned about the environment she was bringing up the kids in.  Following the news, Pitt went public with a statement about his impending divorce which read: “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids.

Jolie released a similar statement saying that the divorce was for the “health of the family.”  This story originally appeared in The Sun."
1,"Jennifer Aniston. Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images  Jennifer Aniston has been extremely fine and okay and great for some time now — she’s married to the artfully manscaped Justin Theroux, she’s working on a show with Reese Witherspoon, and her ex-husband Brad Pitt is in the process of divorcing Angelina Jolie, the woman he started seeing while he and Aniston were still married, a sad fact that must send a shiver of schadenfreude up Jen’s spine now and again. But Aniston doesn’t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar:  My dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a café with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you’re not deprived. I’m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you’re more joyful. There’s a life’s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.  All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:  I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin’s face. He was like, “What is happening?”  Alarming. But that probably wouldn’t happen at Jen’s wellness center of course, because she’s fine, it’s fine, everything’s extremely fine."
1,"In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. “Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively of the pair. “It was an extremely emotional and testing few days.”  The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, “have been fighting constantly over Nicole’s incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,” adds the insider. The trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. “It was Keith’s idea to visit the boot camp,” says the insider. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. “He gave her an ultimatum.”  But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. “They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,” the insider explains.

Now it's getting humiliating.""

Radar exclusively reported that Kelly, 46, debuted on the TODAY show in September, and struggled to fill seats for her opening day. She was later caught faking her way through the premiere episode, and struggled to climb ahead in the ratings.  Kelly also began having trouble booking guests after her Debra Messing and Jane Fonda disasters. Producers ordered Lauer and Guthrie to appear on the show in an attempt to fix Kelly’s image, but now she’s begging Donald Trump to come on her hour-long segment. Stay with Radar for more.

She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet, and, “Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.”  Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.  Ripa’s endorsement came just a day after she appeared to take a dig at Seacrest on the show, with regards to the sexual-misconduct allegations plaguing him.

1,"Now that's a hot couple in the making. Rumour has it that Brad Pitt, following his separation from Angelina Jolie, has his attention diverted to Jennifer Lawrence. According to gossip mongers, the Allied actor has shown interest in dating the Hunger Games star and this will definitely get Jolie worked up.  Sources told Australian tabloid Woman's Day that the actor feels Lawrence fits his criteria of a perfect girlfriend.  ""Jennifer 'ticks' all of Brad's boxes in all the right ways. She's gorgeous, the hottest name in Hollywood and seems to like older guys,"" the insider told the magazine, referring to her recent boyfriend and Mother! director Darren Aronofsky. It was recently confirmed that the director-actress couple are no longer dating each other.  Coming back to JLaw and Pitt, the grapevine claims that Pitt had reached out to director Quentin Tarantino to help him get Lawrence's phone number. The two actors are apparently texting each other and getting to know each other better.  The source maintains that while Pitt is attracted to Lawrence, he has an interior motive in all this. Apparently, the actor is looking at dating women who can ""make Angelina Jolie jealous,"" and Lawrence fits the bill.  ""Brad hasn't dated much since the breakdown of his marriage, so Jen is a very lucky girl to have his undivided attention. He can't wait to get to know her better, and if all goes well, he thinks they could be Hollywood's next big power couple,"" the insider explains.  While this is a juicy gossip, Gossip Cop argues that there is no truth in the claim. Contradicting Woman's Day's sources, the website's insiders claim that these are merely rumours and hold no truth.  ""The actor hasn't been pursuing Lawrence, nor is he on a mission to make his estranged wife jealous,"" the site reports. However, there has been no confirmation or denial from the two actors' managers or representatives."
1,"Millions around the world watched as Meghan Markle tied the knot with Prince Harry last Saturday, walking down the aisle of St. George's Chapel in a custom gown designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.  The day also marked the big reveal for the fashion world -- after months of anticipation and speculation -- of the wedding dress and designer Clare Waight Keller. Keeping the secret of who would design the royal wedding gown under wraps was no easy task, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie.  Markle, who already had a stash of bridal dress ""inspo"" pictures saved on her phone from Instagram, Pinterest and elsewhere online, began her search for a designer at the urging of her best friend, Jessica Mulroney, according to Scobie, who revealed details of the dress selection process in a Harper's Bazaar article.  Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, already knew what she wanted in her wedding dress: something timeless, elegant and appropriate, Scobie added.  While many designers threw their names in the running to be picked by Markle to design her dress, Waight Keller had been a favorite since the beginning. The designer and bride to be met just before Christmas, Scobie said, and Markle immediately liked what she saw.  “I think she had seen my work and knew what I did,” Waight Keller said in comments to the press after the wedding. “I think she loved the fact that I was a British designer and working in a house such as Givenchy, which has its roots in a classical, beautiful style from the time of Hubert [de Givenchy] himself.”  After Markle officially chose Waight Keller to create her dress, the designer had to keep it a secret from everyone, even her own family, until the wedding day.  Mostly through discreet texts and phone calls, Markle and Waight Keller went back and forth on designing the dress before two teams signed nondisclosure agreements and got to work on it at Givenchy's Paris headquarters and an undisclosed London warehouse, according to Scobie.  Creating the iconic dress ""was all about keeping the secret,"" Waight Keller said.  Hundreds of hours of meticulous stitching later, the finished gown was transported to Windsor Castle for a final fitting in May and was revealed to the world last Saturday.  Keller called the royal wedding a ""dream day"" in a post on Instagram.  Waight Keller also told the press that Prince Harry thanked her for designing the dress for his bride.  ""He came straight up to me and he said, 'Oh my God, thank you! She looks absolutely stunning,'"" Waight Keller recalled. ""Well, I think everybody saw on television -- he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed."""

But it’s time to focus on the future.”  Garner, 45, and Affleck, 44, who each asked for joint custody of their three kids, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, continue to effectively co-parent together, according to sources.  06_12_2017_noUPC-2  While Affleck lived in the guest house on the couple’s L.A. property since he and Garner announced their split in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage, the actor has now moved to a nearby home to remain close to his family.  “They want to be sure the kids are comfortable,” says a source close to both. “It’s all in step with what they’ve always said was the most important thing: their children.”  For more behind Jennifer Garner’s decision to move on, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday  EE British Academy Film Awards, Winners, Royal Opera House, London, Britain - 10th February 2013 Credit: David Fisher/Rex USA  Between her family and career — Garner has three upcoming films, Wakefield; The Tribes of Palos Verdes, which she stars in and executive-produced; and Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda — the actress hasn’t begun to think about dating again just yet.  “She will eventually, but it will be a while before she does,” says the insider. “She’s certainly not jumping up and down and screaming, ‘I’m single!’ and planning dates.

1,"Does Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima’s social media snafu meant they’re on the rocks? Scott Disick hopes so, as we’ve heard he’ll gladly ‘ghost’ Sofia Richie if Kourt’s single again.  When Kourtney Kardashian, 38, deactivated her Instagram and her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, 24, made his account private, many thought there was trouble in paradise between these two. While everything seems to be back to normal, Scott Disick, 34, certainly hopes something is up, as a source close to “The Lord” EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that he’s praying “that Kourtney unfollowing Younes on social media is the beginning of the end for Kourtney and her boy toy. Scott has never stopped loving Kourtney and he always will.” Uh-oh. Well, bad news for Scott: Kourt’s back on the ‘gram and following Younes.  Looks like Scott’s ready to swoop in the second Kourt’s back on the market. Wait. What about Sofia Richie? Scott has had quite the love affair with the 19-year-old. They’ve travelled the world and were even seen having lunch together a few weeks ago. Will Scott stay by Sofia’s side if his baby mama suddenly becomes Younes-less? “If it turns out Kourtney is single again,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, “you can bet that Scott will ghost Sofia and start spending more time at home with Kourt and the kids. As much fun as Scott has been having with Sofia, he still loves Kourt very much and would love to put his family back together.”  That’s….actually a bit harsh for Sofia. Even if this romance with Scott is “just a phase,” like her father Lionel Richie said it is, she doesn’t deserve to get ghosted by Scott the moment Kourt is single. Plus, even if she and Younes have split, it’s not like she’s going to throw open the doors and welcome Scott (and all his problems) back in her life. “The Lord” might want to take a hint and let go of those reconciliation dreams of his.  Also, with Scott ready to spend more with his ex and the kids, Sofia might want to hold on making any long-term plans with her current boyfriend. “Scott has been in a lot of pain since Kourt began sleeping with Younes,” the insider added, “and he’s has been waiting for the day that she deletes him from social media. Scott is hopeful that this as a major sign that it’s the beginning of the end for Kourt and Younes.”"
