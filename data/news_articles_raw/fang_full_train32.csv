E605,0,"ISIS Didn't Actually Tweet a ""Warning"" About the Chattanooga Shooting","This afternoon, an apparent ISIS supporter tweeted the above image along with the text “O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS,” and some in the right-wing media reported that the tweet constituted an advance warning about the deadly attack. The only problem: It was posted long after the shooting began.  Here’s a screencap via Rob Bettis:  Reporting of ISIS tweet is inaccurate. Tweet is time stamped 10:34 *PT* (1:34 ET). 2 hrs after the event.#CHAshooti… pic.twitter.com/KDE8o0cMj9 July 16, 2015  Twitter user @K_H_O7777777777—whose account was suspended this afternoon—published the tweet at 1:34 p.m. Eastern Time, roughly three hours after Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez began firing at a military recruiting center this morning, killing four Marines. Nonetheless, the hysterically anti-Islam blogger Pamela Geller published a post about the hours-late “warning,” and as Mediaite notes, Fox News’ Catherine Herridge said that @K_H_O7777777777 “seemed to have foreknowledge about the shooting” on-air.  [There was a video here]  Geller and Herridge may want to take a closer look at Twitter’s time-zone function. A screencap of the tweet that’s making the rounds on right-wing Twitter does show a 10:34 a.m. timestamp, but that’s only because it was taken somewhere in the Pacific Time Zone, and Twitter displays time stamps in local time."
pheme_106,0,"Ottawa shooting: Harper, Mulcair, Trudeau speak about attack","Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Opposition Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered speeches Wednesday evening in the wake of a shooting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa that left one member of the Canadian Forces dead.  Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist serving with Hamilton’s Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment, was shot dead while guarding the National War Memorial. The gunman, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was later shot dead inside the main Parliament building.  You can watch the speeches and read the text, based in part on prepared remarks, of each of their addresses below.  Stephen Harper  PM speaks on Ottawa shooting News 6:56 Raw video from Stephen Harper 6:56  ""My fellow Canadians: for the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil.  Today our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Cpl. Cirillo was killed today — murdered in cold blood — as he provided a ceremonial honour guard at Canada's National War Memorial, that sacred place that pays tribute to those who gave their lives so that we can live in a free, democratic and safe society.  Likewise, our thoughts and prayers remain also with the family and friends of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired terrorist.  Tonight, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these despicable attacks.  Fellow Canadians, we've also been reminded today of the compassionate and courageous nature of so many Canadians -- like those private citizens and first responders who came to provide aid to Cpl. Cirillo as he fought for his life.  And, of course, the members of our security forces — in the RCMP, the City of Ottawa police and in Parliament — who came quickly and at great risk to themselves to assist those of us who were close to the attack.  Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.  We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values. on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.  But let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.  While today has been without question a difficult day, I have every confidence that Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our country through many challenges.  Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us. For now, Laureen and Ben and Rachel and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched by today's attack. May God bless them and keep our land glorious and free.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair  Opposition speaks about Ottawa shooting News 5:38 Raw video from Tom Mulcair 5:38  [The first four and a half lines of the text below are from prepared remarks that were not caught on video in the CBC broadcast above.]  ""Good evening my fellow Canadians. Today the peace of our nation's capital was shattered by an act of hatred and brutality -- cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, at the heart of who we are.  But I'm here tonight in solidarity, side-by-side with my colleagues, with our Prime Minister and with all Canadians.  This attack struck with sudden and deadly violence. It was carried out on the very ground where we come together to exchange ideas with the knowledge that whatever our differences, we will always resolve them peacefully.  It was intended to make us more fearful of our neighbours and less confident in ourselves. But it has failed. Today's events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.  And to the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces, I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and, indeed, your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.  Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone here in our nation's capital are with the family and loved ones of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Forces member from Hamilton, Ont., who lost his life this morning — the second in just a few days.  Cpl. Cirillo was literally standing on guard at a monument dedicated to the sacrifice of others who came before him. To his family and friends, I tell you that 35 million Canadians at home and abroad from coast to coast to coast and around the world stand with you tonight, and we will not forget.  In this moment, Canadians are unified in grief and stricken with disbelief. Canada is shaken today, but we shall not waver. We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow, we will do the same.  These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate. They will not. We will stand up, we will stand together. We will persevere, and we will prevail.  Good evening.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau  Liberal leader speaks about Ottawa shooting News 10:18 Raw video from Justin Trudeau 10:18  ""My fellow Canadians: I’m speaking to you from a Parliament Hill just coming out of lockdown. I am deeply saddened by today’s horrific events here in Ottawa and unreservedly condemn these brutal and heartless acts of violence. This attack is unforgivable. Should any other perpetrators or co-conspirators exist, they must be caught and be punished to the full force of our laws.  I’ve extended an offer of full support to the government along with any assistance members of our party can provide at this time. My thoughts and prayers, along with those of my colleagues, go out to the family and friends of the victims of today’s horrific shooting, including Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, who was standing dutifully, guarding one of our nation’s most sacred monuments.  It was a cowardly act — an unarmed man was murdered in cold blood, at close range. Words cannot express this deep sadness we feel over his loss. To the brave women and men who rushed to the scene to confront the shooter and to help keep us safe, I say only, 'Thank you. Thank you for your selfless courage and your professionalism in this time of crisis.'  In the days that follow, there will be questions, anger and perhaps confusion. This is natural, but we cannot let this get the better of us. Losing ourselves to fear and speculation is the intention of those who commit these heinous acts. They mean to shake us. We will remain resolved. They want us to forget ourselves. Instead, we will remember. We will remember who we are.  We are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.  Our dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.  Criminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.  Today, some speak of the loss of innocence in Canada. This is inaccurate. Canada is not and has never been innocent to the threats we face. And we know, as we have always known, that we are not immune. What is true is that we have never let those threats shape us, and we have never bowed to those who mean to undermine our values and our way of life. We have remained Canadians, and this is how we will carry on.  We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack. And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith. Continued mutual co-operation and respect will help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.  We will walk forward together, not apart.  In the coming days, we will be inundated with pictures and videos showing what happened today. But there is one in particular we should all remember: the picture in our minds we have of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians. That is who we truly are, and it is who we shall continue to be.  Good night."""
pheme_155,0,Attack on Ottawa: PM Harper cites terrorist motive,"The attack on Parliament Hill’s Centre Block and the National War Memorial has left one Canadian soldier and one male suspect dead.  During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.  ""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""  The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week’s events.  Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.  Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.  Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board.  Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau has a record in Quebec in the early 2000s for petty crimes such as possession of drugs, credit-card forgery and robbery. He was also charged with robbery in 2011 in Vancouver.

Cirillo, who was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton, was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency, his aunt told The Globe and Mail.  “We’re still in the process of an active operation right now. We’re treating this very seriously with the RCMP in identifying and clearing Parliament Hill to render it safe,” Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau told a mid-afternoon media briefing.  Shortly after 8:30 p.m. (ET) Ottawa police lifted the lockdown in the city's downtown core saying that the threat to public safety no longer remained.  However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.  Asked if the attack had caught police off guard, Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the RCMP’s national division, said: “I think that from our reaction, it caught us by surprise.”  Still, he said “all available and necessary resources were activated and deployed immediately” and will remain in place as long as necessary.  Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.  A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.  THE SHOOTING: FEDERAL BUILDINGS PUT INTO LOCKDOWN  Gunfire erupted at the National War Memorial around 9:52 a.m. (ET), then moved to Parliament Hill’s Centre Block. The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.  The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.  Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman. ""All the details are not in but the sergeant-at-arms, a former Mountie, is the one that engaged the gunman, or one of them at least, and stopped this,"" Fantino said."

E766,0,A lesson in time: 1917 chalkboards found in Oklahoma school,"When contractors came in to replace the chalkboards at a high school in Oklahoma, they thought they would find a few problems in the walls. Instead, they found a hidden treasure of sorts: Chalkboards dating back almost 100 years.  ""I got goosebumps, and then I got tears in my eyes,"" said Sherry Kishore, the principal at Emerson High School in Oklahoma City. ""It was like walking into a time capsule.""  The century-old chalkboards were found underneath the current boards that were being replaced by the school to make way for more modern whiteboards.  Among the vibrantly coloured images displayed on the old chalkboards: a girl dressed in bright pink petting the tail of a turkey; cursive handwriting of the American Pledge of Allegiance; and a calendar with 1917 written above it.  The Oklahoma City Public School District believe the students were learning about pilgrims because every board has a similar lesson on them.  ""When you walk into these rooms, it's like they just left the lesson and they’re expecting to come back the next day and start again,"" Kishore said.  The district says it will preserve the lessons, so others can have the same feeling of taking a step back in time.  There's no definitive proof that the boards are from 1917 beyond the calendar written on the board.  But if they are, the chalkboards would have been installed only 28 years after the founding of Oklahoma City in 1889.  The discovery is a miracle given the city's location in the eye of Tornado Alley, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. The U.S. National Weather Service says tornadoes have hit the city more than 150 times since 1890.  Now the chalkboards that once taught history to students will be used to show the history of a time long passed for the community.  ""I think seeing this reminds them how far we've come,"" Kishore said. ""And actually [that's] what teaching is all about."""
pheme_15,0,Paris Massacre Suspects Killed in Dramatic Hostage Raids,"DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.  In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.  In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.  French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.  The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.  The U.S. on Friday issued a worldwide travel alert warning that terrorists could target Westerners. French authorities Friday were trying to establish whether any of the attackers had ties to extremist Islamist groups in France or abroad.  The gunman at the grocery store, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, is believed to be connected to the Kouachi brothers, authorities said. French police were hunting for a woman they say was an accomplice, Hayat Boumeddiene. Five people connected to the attackers are still being held by authorities, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.  Explosions and gunfire rang out in both places — at the printing factory in the countryside town of Dammartin-en-Goele and at the kosher market in Paris — in what the French hoped was a conclusion to the spasm of terror that has gripped France for more than two days.  One hostage was freed at the printing factory, authorities said. At the market, four hostages were killed and 15 were freed, according to Israeli government officials who spoke to their French counterparts. The four dead hostages were killed by the gunman before the police raid, Molins said. Four officers were injured, including one who was seriously hurt.  In a speech to the country, President Francois Hollande thanked the security forces for their professionalism. He said that the threat of terrorism was not over, but he said France had overcome its challenge.  ""We are free when we are not afraid,"" he said. ""We carry an idea that is bigger than ourselves, and we are able to defend it everywhere where peace is threatened.""  He cautioned against racism and called for a national march of unity on Sunday. He described the hostage siege at the kosher market as ""a terrible anti-Semitic act.""  U.S. officials have said that Said Kouachi, 34, trained with al Qaeda in Yemen several years ago, and his younger brother was convicted on a terrorism charge in 2008. They had been on the run since speeding away from the magazine’s offices after the attack on Wednesday.  The brothers were spotted Friday by police driving in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 20 miles outside the capital, at about 9:30 a.m. local time, or 3:30 a.m. ET. A gunfight broke out, and the brothers apparently holed up in the nearest building they could find, a family-owned printing business, taking a company manager hostage. Said Kouachi was shot in the throat during the gunfight, Molins said.  Yves Albarello, a French lawmaker, was quoted by the French TV station i-Tele as saying that the Kouachi brothers had told police they wanted to “die as martyrs.” The report could not be confirmed by NBC News.  Hours later came word of a second siege at the kosher market. It was not clear how many people were inside, but Thibeaut, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman, suggested there were many because it was the morning before the Jewish Sabbath, which begins Friday night.  Many ambulances were outside the market, and police asked all businesses nearby to close.  The Associated Press, citing an unnamed police official, reported that the gunman had threatened to kill hostages if police stormed the printing plant 25 miles away.  Authorities locked down schools near Dammartin-en-Goele. At one, the Lycee Charles de Gaulle, about 500 students were being kept inside.  “We are all scared,” one student, Angelina Monzili, 16, told NBC News. “We came to school expecting a normal day. We were told that the terrorists are really close. Our families are worried about us. We saw police cars flying past, and ambulances.”  People who live in the area were to told to stay away from windows, turn off lights and stay indoors. “It’s basically a war zone in Dammartin-en-Goele,” one witness told BFM TV.  Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France as the twin dramas played out.  Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport told NBC News that some aircraft coming into land had been redirected to its southern two runways, which are further away from Dammartin-en-Goele. “The town is a little bit too close to the airport,” a spokesman said.  In the tense hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, profiles began to emerge of the Kouachi brothers, who were known to French and American counterterrorism officials.  Two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News that Said Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be trained by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is considered the most violent branch of the terror network.  Cherif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to prison in 2008 after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers had been on the U.S. no-fly list “for years.”  A purported member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed in a Twitter message that the group directed the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to Flashpoint Intelligence, a global security firm and an NBC News counterterrorism consultant.  During the siege, Cherif Kouachi spoke by telephone to a French television station, saying he ""was sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda"" and had been financed by the group's leader, Anwar al-Awlaki before Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.  The final gun battle began after the brothers emerged from the printing factory and started shooting, Molins said. Security forces returned fire, killing them. Their hostage, the company manager, escaped unharmed. It later turned out that a second plant employee had been hiding under a sink, undetected during the entire ordeal.  Investigators found ammunition and heavy weapons in the factory, including a rocket launcher, Molins said.  On Thursday, elite anti-terrorist forces converged on several villages after two masked robbers with machine guns matching the Kouachi brothers' description held up a gas station in Villers-Cotteret, France.  Charlie Hebdo’s offices had been firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The publication’s chief editor — who was known as Charb — was an outspoken supporter of free speech who had reportedly been put on an al Qaeda hit list. He was among those slain.  NBC News' Alexander Smith, Nikolai Miller, Jason Cumming, Richard Engel, Robert Windrem and Pete Williams, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Nancy Ing reported from Paris.

E672,0,Oregon Bakery Must Pay For Refusing To Make Wedding Cake For Lesbian Couple,"The owners of an Oregon bakery must pay $135,000 in damages for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, a state official ruled on Thursday.  Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian agreed with a preliminary ruling that Sweet Cakes by Melissa illegally discriminated against a Portland couple in 2013 by turning down their request based on their sexual orientation, The Oregonian reported.  A judge had ordered owners Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay $75,000 in damages to Rachel Bowman-Crye and another $60,000 to her wife, Laurel Bowman-Cryer.  The Kleins had argued it was against their Christians beliefs to participate in a same-sex marriage. Supporters raised money for them earlier this year after an administrative law judge imposed the penalty.  The Bowman-Cryers, through their attorney Paul Thompson, said in a statement they were glad Avakian sent ""a clear message that discrimination will simply not be tolerated in our state.""  ""This has been a terrible ordeal for our entire family. We never imagined finding ourselves caught up in a fight for social justice,"" they said.  ""We endured daily, hateful attacks on social media, received death threats and feared for our family's safety, yet our goal remained steadfast. We were determined to ensure that this kind of blatant discrimination never happened to another couple, another family, another Oregonian,"" the statement continued. ""Everyone deserves to be treated as an equal member of society.""  An email to HuffPost, the bakery said the decision was wrong, adding, ""Americans should tolerate diverse opinions, not use the government to punish fellow citizens with different views. This case has become a poster for an overpowered elected official using his position to root out thought and speech with which he personally disagrees.""  The owners vowed in a Facebook post to appeal the decision:  ""The final ruling has been made today. We have been charged with $135,000 in emotional damages, But also now Aaron has been charged with advertising. (Basically talking about not wanting to participate in a same-sex wedding) This effectively strips us of all our first amendment rights. According to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech. We will NOT give up this fight, and we will NOT be silenced. We stand for God's truth, God's word and freedom for ALL americans. We are here to obey God not man, and we will not conform to this world. If we were to lose everything it would be totally worth it for our Lord who gave his one and only son, Jesus, for us! God will win this fight.  The Sweet Cakes website features quotations from Biblical passages, such as, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight"" from the book of Proverbs. It also explicitly states the bakery is interested in baking for weddings between a man and a woman.  ""We here at Sweet Cakes strongly believe that when a man and woman come together to be joined as one, it is truly one of the most special days of their lives,"" the homepage said. ""We feel truely [sic] honored when we are chosen to do the cake for your special day."""
E121,0,"Obama Signs Law To Lower The Age Of Consensual Sex To 13 Years Of Age, Effective 3/1/16","Washington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Monday by the Obama Administration which states a new law that will take effect March 1, 2016 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.  The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.  In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.  This bill has faced extreme backlash from conservative groups as well as Republican presidential hopefuls. Donald Trump mentioned in a statement that if he is elected president he will immediately revoke this new law putting the age of consent across the country to 18 years of age."
politifact374,0,The Associated Press: Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support,"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., looks on as he walks along his tour of the National Gypsum plant Sunday, Feb. 24, 2008, in Lorain, Ohio. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)  Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support  LORAIN, Ohio (AP) — Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary.  At the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal ""would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.""  One day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words.  ""Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,"" Obama said. ""Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America — and I never have.""  ""The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,"" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland.  ""A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, ""I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,"" he said.  The trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.  Ohio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.  Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.  On another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.  Asked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.""  He also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war ""in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed"" or were sent into the war zone without enough training.  Polls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.  Given that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.  At the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.  He said Clinton has ""essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.""  On Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals ""unless they are positive for American workers.""  To an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.  ""Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,"" he said. ""But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas."""

Dr Anne Aly, an expert in homegrown terrorism at Curtin University who sits on the Council for Australian-Arab Relations, believes the gunman is indeed a lone actor, without training or support from a wider terrorist network.  ""There's a trend of lone opportunistic actors"", she told VICE News. ""We used to talk about terrorist cells, but now rather than individual cells we have lone actors taking things into their own hands. They're inspired by groups such as IS and they think they're contributing to that group.""  ""But what we've seen in the past,"" Aly continued, ""is this is how groups end.

The crisis began just before 10 a.m. local time when at least two gunmen entered the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at Martin Place in Sydney’s main business area. Channel 7, which said its newsroom near the cafe had been evacuated, reported that at least thirteen hostages had been taken, including staff and customers.  Images shown by local media organizations showed hostages pressed against windows while holding up a black flag with Islamic writing, saying “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God.” The flag is not specifically associated with the Islamic State (ISIS) group, as was reported on social media.  New South Wales (NSW) police confirmed a major police operation was underway in the city’s main business area, and said a number of streets as well as Martin Place train station had been shut down. “Police are dealing with an armed incident and specialist officers are attempting to make contact those inside a café,” the force said in a statement.  The area surrounding the chocolate cafe was immediately evacuated after the crisis began, with heavily armed police taking positions nearby. Authorities ordered those in streets bordering Martin Place to remain indoors and away from open windows, and asked others in the area but further away to leave their buildings.  “Police urge members of the public to remain calm and note that an appropriate police presence is in place. Police urge the media to be responsible in their reporting. Speculation can cause unnecessary alarm,” the statement added, giving no further details about the incident.  Sydney’s Opera House and several other locations in Sydney were also evacuated as a precaution. Earlier reports that Sydney’s airspace had been shut down were rejected by officials, though Qantas said its planes were being diverted around Sydney’s main business area due to the incident.  “New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking in Martin Place in Sydney,” Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in an emailed statement. “I have spoken with NSW Premiere Mike Baird and offered him all possible Commonwealth support and assistance.”  Abbott, who offered few details about the situation, said the cabinet’s National Security Committee had convened for briefings on the situation.  “This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,” the prime minister added. “We will provide regular updates as further information becomes available.”  The siege began as Australian Federal Police (AFP) scheduled a press conference to announce the arrest of a 25-year-old Beecroft man who has been taken into custody in connection with an alleged plot to carry out a terrorist attack on Australian soil, though it was not immediately clear whether it was linked to Monday’s crisis. The press conference was canceled as news of the siege broke.  (Copyright 2014 by BNO News B.V. All rights reserved. Info: sales@bnonews.com.)"
E263,1,Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom,"Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom – News 8 Louisiana – Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua Johnson shoving sausages under her shirt. CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.  The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will “haunt his dreams forever.” The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said that when he entered “She didn’t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.”  Woman Arrested For Masturbating With Jimmy Dean Sausage In Walmart Bathroom  Shocked, and also frightened for his safety due to the fact that Johnson is a “big girl,” the 140 pound security guard said he ran out until police arrived. When they did, female officers entered the restroom with Johnson still “putting in work with the sausage.” All in all, it took 7 police officers to restrain Johnson and pry the victimized sausage out of the woman’s hands. She was arrested and taken into custody where she was charged with shoplifting, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. Walmart management said in no way do they tolerate this type of behavior. They have a strict policy against shoplifters and a sign on the bathroom door that clearly reads, “No merchandise allowed beyond this point.”"
politifact13501,1,Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again “Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More”,"Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.  “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”  Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.  “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”  “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded."

E116,1,41-Lb. Rat Caught in New York City?,"On 22 November 2015, the Facebook page New Yorkers posted a photograph purportedly showing a 41-lb rat caught in New York City:    41 pound rat recently caught in NYC… (via Chris Brannigan)  Although image was widely shared by various online outlets, no one provided any substantive information about the allegedly enormous rodent.  If the pictured rat were truly was “caught” in New York City, it would most likely have been a brown rat (also known as a Norway or Norwegian rat). The city is home to approximately two million brown rats, according to a 2014 study, but these rodents only grow to about 20 inches in length and 2 lbs. in weight.  As many commenters pointed out on in responding to the original Facebook post, the pictured animal doesn’t look like it was “caught” at all. The rat appears to be groomed and cleaned and was most likely someone’s pet. If that’s the case, this animal is probably a Gambian Pouch Rat. While these rodents are a fair bit larger than the brown rat, they don’t typically grow any bigger than four pounds.  So why does the rat pictured above appear so massive? It’s likely the result of forced perspective. The person is holding the rat (whose hands cannot be seen) is probably using a pole to place the animal closer to the camera. This technique creates the illusion that what is likely just an average-sized rat appears to be much larger in the photograph.  For comparison’s sake, here’s a photograph of a 3-foot Gambian Pouch Rat that was caught in New York in 2012:"
pheme_50,1,Prince fans turned away from Massey Hall,"Hundreds of Prince fans who lined up for hours outside Massey Hall had their hopes dashed Tuesday afternoon when promoter Live Nation confirmed on Twitter that there would be no concert that night after all.  Fans of the pop legend reported being turned away without tickets or wristbands — and no word on whether a surprise show would be scheduled for Wednesday.  “When we were told very abruptly after seven hours of waiting that ‘Prince would not be playing Massey Hall this evening’ and they were ‘taking the barricades down,’ it was quite shocking that there was no more information given,” said Rebecca Webster, a local music publicist who was near the front of the line on Tuesday.  “I don’t know who is at fault for that. When I left, there were a lot of people determined that there was a show that evening.”  Indeed, there were still some diehards lined up outside Massey Hall at 7:30 p.m. in the rain, a testament to the dedication of Prince’s fans.  In a Facebook post Tuesday night, promoter Live Nation apologized for “any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today.”  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal,” the post said. “There was no concert scheduled for today.”  A statement from 3rdeyegirl, Prince’s collaborating band, on Tuesday evening added: “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances . . .  “We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  But it was 3rdeyegirl that helped cause the commotion to begin with. Social media had picked up on the rumour early Tuesday morning after the band issued a cryptic tweet with Toronto spelled backwards: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING. . . ”  The tweet was quickly deleted around 8:30 a.m., but not before it spread like wildfire online.  Many posted on social media that tickets to the show would reportedly cost $10 and only the first 200 people in line would be let in. Others said there could be a pair of shows performed by Prince: one Tuesday night and another Wednesday.  Scott Morin, a 40-year-old jazz record label manager and lifelong Prince fan, said he was tipped off about the show when his Google Alerts awoke him Monday night to inform him of the 3rdeyegirl tweet.  He said he quickly mobilized a handful of friends, also Prince aficionados, and made it to the front of the Massey Hall lineup by 7:45 a.m.  “I figured there would be quite a lineup, but there were only a few people, so we lucked out,” he said while motioning to the hundreds and counting who had lined up behind him in the hours after.  Rebecca Webster had made it to Massey Hall at 8 a.m. to find herself fourth in line. She and her friends figured the rumours were plausible.  “The venue (Massey Hall) was available, the artist was nearby (New York) and the style of the announcement was very in keeping with how he likes to do things,” she said. “When we arrived there was full security detail and barriers set up. So we waited.”  And waited. And waited.  Webster says she often works with high-profile touring artists.  “I’ve managed guest lists for ‘surprise shows’ and most of the time they are kept fairly secret within the own artist camps as everyone has a hard time keeping a secret. What I’m saying is, it’s not an easy task to execute this kind of thing.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  Morin noted that this wouldn’t have been the first time Prince played a secret show.  In February last year, the performer played two consecutive surprise sets at the Electric Ballroom in London, England, and in British folksinger Lianne La Havas’s home.  Those shows were also sparked by a cryptic tweet from 3rdeyegirl.  With files from Ben Rayner  Read more about:"
E175,1,Rumblr 'Tinder for Fighting' app lets you challenge people to brawls,"In the film Fight Club, groups of bored men led by Brad Pitt were depicted meeting up in secret to take part in bare knuckle brawls.  But a new web-based application promises to make such fights a reality by pitting violent strangers against each other.  Described as a Tinder for Fight Club, Rumblr allows users to arrange impromptu fights based on their location.  Rumblr has been described as 'Tinder for Fight Club' (left). It allows users to upload pictures of themselves along with a short profile so they can challenge other users and arrange to meet them for a fight (right)  It features a chat function to allow opponents to trash talk each other and an interactive map showing where fights are happening so others can go along to watch.  According to the app creator's website: 'Rumblr is an app for recreational fighters to find, meet, and fight other brawl enthusiasts nearby.  IS THE RUMBLR APP LEGAL? People using the app may find themselves in breach of the law in some states and countries. Fighting in a public place is classed as disorderly conduct while arranging a fight to be attended by an audience could be considered an unlawful public assembly. In some areas seriously injuring someone in a fight can result in criminal charges even if the other person does not seek to press charges. In response to questions from MailOnline, the app's developers did warn that some users may risk prosecution if they used the app to arrange a fight. They said: 'Depending on where they fight, they may be. Regulations are different for every municipality and governing body.' They added, however, that those who criticised the app for encouraging violence were 'not open minded enough about the community we are providing value to'. Advertisement  'You don't need to fight to use Rumblr.  'With Rumblr Explore, anyone can browse and attend fights close by that other Rumblr users have arranged - all for free.'  The app was initially due to be released on Apple's App Store, but was rejected.  Apple has strict rules about apps that encourage violence or result in physical harm.  Instead the app will be released as a web app, and it has already attracted more than 300,000 people from around the world.  Speaking to MailOnline, Rumblr's developers Matt Henderson and Jack Kim, said: 'We've been recreational fighters our entire lives and were tired of the inefficiencies that exist when trying to find someone to fight.  'Rumblr alleviates the trouble fighters have when searching for suitable opponents.  'We were actually rejected by Apple's App Store so we have decided to transition Rumblr into a public, globally accessible web application.'  The web app is due to be launched at at 5pm EST (10pm GMT) today.  According to the developers, it works by allowing users to build a profile of themselves, including statistics about their weight and ability.  The 1999 film Fight Club, starring Brad Pitt (pictured), showed groups of bored men meeting up at underground gatherings to fight each other. Rumblr aims to overcome some of the difficulties faced by real life 'recreational fighters' when looking for someone to challenge  Rumblr includes a chat feature that allows users to challenge each other, lay down insults and make arrangements for a brawl (left). They can then broadcast these details so they appear on a map (right), allowing other users to see fights that are happening in their area  The app uses these to match fighters together who are nearby, but it also allows users to challenge each other based on their profile picture.  It encourages the fighters to lay down a challenge by 'telling your match what you don't like about their picture'.  When a challenge is accepted, the users can arrange a time and location before broadcasting the final details to attract a cloud.  .@Capn_CoolChris Rumblr will be available as a web application at https://t.co/tcYjoatwH7 Monday, Nov. 9th at 5:00 PM EST. 👊 — Rumblr (@rumblrapp) November 9, 2015  WHY BOYS WITH BEARDS ARE BAD They may have become to the go-to fashion accessory for men, but those with beards are more likely to be sexist, get into fights, cheat on their partners and steal, two new studies have revealed. The first of the two surveys, which involved 500 men aged between 18 and 72 from India and the US, studied men with nine facial hairstyles varying in length - from light stubble to a heavy beard. The group was asked to pick one that best matched their own facial hair and were then asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements about gender roles. The results revealed that 86 per cent of Indian men and 65 per cent of American men had facial hair, and those with beards of any length agreed more with hostile sexist statements than men without any facial hair.

E41,1,"President Obama Scores 102 On IQ Test, Lowest In Presidential History","0  WASHINGTON, D.C. –  As it turns out, the Republicans may have been right all along, and President Obama is not the smartest person in the room after all. Since Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, all presidents have been given an IQ test at some point during their time as leader. Gerald Ford always held the record for lowest score, with a 111, which is considered just slightly above average. On the other end of the spectrum, George W. Bush scored a 132, which is considered ‘gifted.’ Two-Thirds of people who take the standardized IQ test score between 85-115.  The White House today spun President Obama’s 102 as a ‘solid average’ that is nothing to be ashamed of.  ”President Obama never claimed to be smarter than anybody else. As a matter as fact, he has always represented himself as a regular guy, ‘a man of the people,’ as it were,” said Josh Earnest, White House Press Secretary. “The key to being a good leader is to surround yourself with smart people, which President Obama has always done. As far as needing to be a genius to run the country, well – George W. Bush had the highest score ever, and look at how that mess turned out. So, the next time President Obama bypasses congress with an executive order, and you’re about to say something cruel, racist, or otherwise completely ignorant, remember that he’s just a regular guy getting things done for you. And hey! At least he’s in the triple digits!”  “Ha! I knew it! King Obama is just a few points away from being a dummy,” said Senator Ted Cruz. ”Einstein was a 160, and guess what America – I scored 145! I’m smarter than 99% of you!

You don’t have to be deprived of the beautiful and womanly occurrence of menstruation merely because you were born without uterus. The Fem-Flo’s cotton core contains a small, vegetable-based capsule which upon reaching body temperature releases the “menses” contained within. It also aids in keeping the post-op canal conditioned and dilated after surgery and beyond.”  Although United Media Publishing‘s web site doesn’t feature a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, earlier articles from that outlet include a false claim that Charles Manson had died in prison and another fabricated story about Christian couples “divorcing en masse” in protest of same-sex marriage.  Interest in the transgender tampons claim peaked on 9 July 2015, when Twitter and Internet forum posters said that radio host Rush Limbaugh had discussed the article on his show.

E464,1,Arnold Schwarzenegger's last act as governor follows him,"(CNN) In Hollywood, there's no better magnet for stargazing than a movie premiere. So on a Sunday afternoon in late June, the summer sun couldn't keep thousands of fans from lining Hollywood Boulevard, hoping to spot a star.  This was the ""Terminator Genisys"" premiere , and only one star mattered: Arnold Schwarzenegger . The former governor of California shook hands, signed autographs and posed for selfies. It's the kind of personal attention Fred and Kathy Santos wish they could get from Schwarzenegger , who they say stole justice from their dead son.  ""He plays a hero in the movies, yet in real life he's not a hero,"" Fred Santos said. ""He's a dirty politician.""  Minutes before ending his two terms as governor, Schwarzenegger issued his final act: Commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing to death the Santos' son, Luis, in 2008.  It's not that a governor issuing clemency was anything new. But neither the Santos family nor San Diego County prosecutors had any idea it was coming, let alone got a chance to plead their case. Instead, they were informed by a news release and a phone call from a reporter.  ""My son (was) stabbed in the heart when he was alive,"" Fred Santos told CNN. ""Schwarzenegger stabbed him in the back after my son is killed.""  At first, Fred Santos asked himself why the governor would care about their case. But deep down he knew. Santos feared political influence from the beginning -- ever since learning that Esteban Nunez wasn't just any accused killer.  He was the son of Fabian Nunez, California's most powerful Democrat and a political ally to the governor. So to many, such as San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, Schwarzenegger's surprise commutation appeared as if Nunez was cashing in.  ""I think it was political cronyism at its worst.""  The speaker's son, a brutal crime  When Fabian Nunez was sworn in as speaker of the California Assembly in 2004, his son was by his side. At 15, Esteban Nunez appeared baby-faced and shy -- nothing like the muscular, tattooed adult described in court records just four years later.  It was October 2008, and prosecutors alleged that Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were fueling their anger with alcohol. They had just been denied entry to a fraternity party near the campus of San Diego State University (neither were students there), and they were looking for revenge. The Sacramento natives were going to show them how it was done ""in Sac town,"" the pair boasted, according to court records.  ""They decided they were going to either burn a frat house or they were going to stab some people,"" Dumanis said.  Armed with knives, they walked the streets at 2 a.m. until they encountered Luis Santos and a friend. After an initial altercation, Luis called several more friends who ran to his aid.  ""It was a melee basically, where two of the boys were stabbed. One went into an induced coma,"" Dumanis said. ""Luis was stabbed, and one got smashed in the eye.""  ""My boy's dying, my boy's dying,"" Luis' friend screamed to a 911 dispatcher.  ""Stay awake Luis, stay awake,"" another friend sobbed.  A knife pierced the left ventricle of Luis' heart. He died at the scene.  Later that same night, Nunez, Jett and two others piled into a car and headed north to Sacramento. Surveillance video at a 7-Eleven captured Jett and Nunez leaving the store with a Big Gulp cup. They filled it with $1.30 worth of gasoline and used it to burn their weapons and bloody clothes, throwing the items into the Sacramento River and agreeing to never speak of the incident.  But witnesses helped police identify four suspects, and two of them weren't so quiet. The pair fingered Nunez and Jett as the stabbers, later getting probation in exchange for their testimony.  Two months after getting a phone call that their son was dead, the phone rang again at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. Their son's alleged killers were behind bars, and a reporter had a question: What was their reaction to the son of Fabian Nunez being arrested for Luis' murder?  ""My concern was that politics might interfere with justice in the legal system,"" Fred Santos told CNN.  Though assured the system would not bend to politics, Santos says he grew up in Asia, where ""politicians are dirty.""  ""I asked if the judge was a Democrat,"" he said, believing Fabian Nunez's power in that party would influence the case.  The judge was a Republican. In time, however, the judge would become the least of Santos' worries.  Foes to friends  By the time Esteban Nunez was charged with murder, his father had already derailed Arnold Schwarzenegger's early years in office. The Republican governor tried to bypass Nunez and the Democrats by calling for too many special elections on pet projects, with failing results.  ""I got to tell you, things are very sloppy here on the first floor,"" Nunez once told reporters, referring to the governor's office.  Schwarzenegger returned the jab in private conversations that were recorded and later released to news organizations.  ""Fabian is too much a political operator,"" he told his staff, apparently unaware of the recording. ""Not so much passion about specific things he stands for.""  But with his policies stalling in Sacramento, Schwarzenegger announced a shift in strategy in a State of the State address, conceding his mistakes and pledging to work with Nunez and the Democrats. The tactic proved beneficial for both sides. The pair stood side-by-side when California passed legislation creating the highest minimum wage in the nation, one of many victories out of a newly minted political friendship.  In 2008, though, Schwarzenegger did not publicly get involved in Nunez's personal problems. Instead, with his son facing a first degree murder charge and fighting for a lower bail amount, Fabian Nunez called on his Democratic friends to vouch for the credibility of his son. A union leader, a retired assemblyman and even then-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa submitted letters to the judge.  On official mayoral stationery, Villaraigosa wrote that Esteban had shared meals at his home and that he was ""a young man of good and upright character.""  ""They already have the mayor trying to influence the judge,"" Fred Santos said. ""Nobody in power was speaking (for us). We're just regular folks.""  The deal  In 2010, Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were moments away from their murder trial. A first degree conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. A second degree conviction, 15 to life.  But then, with jury selection already underway, came the next twist in this case: a plea deal for Nunez and Jett. If the pair pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, they would face a maximum of 16 years behind bars. For the Santos family it sounded too brief, but would offer swift justice and an end to years of future pain.  ""So we will not be spending the rest of our lives going to court ... listening to them fight their appeal if they were convicted,"" Fred Santos said.  For District Attorney Dumanis, a plea bargain also removed, in her mind, the only impediment to an otherwise airtight case: proving who actually stabbed Luis.  Witness testimony pointed to Jett as Luis' killer, while Nunez stabbed two other boys who survived. Was that enough to pin first- or second-degree murder on Esteban Nunez? The question no longer needed an answer when all sides agreed to a deal. Nunez and Jett pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.  ""I couldn't believe we were giving this case away,"" said Rick Clabby, then deputy district attorney, in an interview with CNN.  Now retired, Clabby believes the evidence was strong enough for at least a second-degree murder conviction.  ""We charged Nunez with conspiracy, too,"" Clabby said. ""It didn't matter if the jury couldn't decide who was the stabber.""  But Dumanis stressed the emotional toll on the victims and approved the deal.  As part of the plea, Nunez admitted that his actions led to the death of Luis Santos. Both Nunez and Jett were sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison.  Calling it ""bitter satisfaction,"" the Santoses thought their son's newly confessed killers would go away quietly and pay for their crimes, content with the plea deal they had just reached.  ""Had I known what was going to happen,"" said Dumanis, ""that (deal) never would have been an agreement.""  The governor's final act  On January 2, 2011, six months after their son's convicted killers were sent to prison, the phone rang at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. It was another reporter.  ""That's been the story of our life, a reporter calls the house and gives me information,"" said Kathy Santos.  This time, she was told of the surprise commutation and immediately went online for more information.  ""There was Esteban's face,"" she said, ""with a little blurb about Arnold's dirty deed.""  Minutes before leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced the commutation in an emailed news release. Esteban Nunez's sentence had been cut in half. He would be eligible for release in April of 2016.  ""I was so disgusted,"" Kathy Santos said. ""Esteban has been coddled, he hasn't had to be accountable because apparently his father has gotten him off.""  Fabian Nunez has publicly denied he forced Schwarzenegger into granting a favor, but he also wasn't complaining. Nunez has repeatedly maintained that his son got a raw deal because he was related to a powerful lawmaker.  ""From the beginning, my son was the headliner in the case,"" Nunez told CNN affiliate KCRA in 2011. He declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview, but after an initial version of this story aired on television, Nunez spoke to CNN over the phone.  ""This has gone from aiding and abetting to him being labeled a killer,"" Nunez said of his son.  He argues that comments from the Santos family, their attorneys and the district attorney's office have boiled the case down to a convenient narrative: Esteban Nunez accepted a plea deal, then had it cut in half because of the influence of his father. In reality, Fabian Nunez told CNN, ""the case is more complicated,"" and that his son sought clemency to right wrongs perpetrated on them by an ""overzealous district attorney"" and a ""conservative judge.""  ""My son did not want to take the deal"" if it meant he had to accept 16 years behind bars, Nunez said. ""He was going to go to trial"" and defend his position that Esteban was not nearly the aggressor that the prosecution was making him out to be.  ""This was a fight among a large group"" of people, Fabian Nunez said, adding that the two suspects who were given probation in exchange for their testimony ""were just as responsible as my son.""  In a letter to the court objecting to the sentence, Fabian Nunez claims the judge overreached in giving Esteban the full 16 years because his son, unlike Jett, ""had no criminal record"" and that Esteban ""did not harm Mr. Santos,"" referring to the witness who claimed Jett inflicted the fatal blow.  Fabian Nunez went on to claim his son was misled by the judge, who ""told us that (he) would treat Esteban differently"" from Jett.  ""He told the attorney one thing in chambers, then went into open court and said another,"" Fabian Nunez told CNN.  Prosecutors maintain they warned Esteban in open court that he could receive 16 years.  The judge denied that he made conflicting statements and refused to reconsider the sentence.  Esteban Nunez and his attorneys continued their fight until December 6, when they submitted a motion to end their appeal.  Less than a month later, Nunez received clemency.  ""I believe Nunez's sentence is excessive,"" wrote Schwarzenegger in his commutation letter, citing the lack of criminal history and the inability to prove that Nunez actually stabbed Luis Santos.  ""It was a complete betrayal of a system of justice and fairness,"" said Dumanis, the district attorney, who questions whether Nunez even submitted a clemency application to the governor. Nunez's attorney, Charles Sevilla, told CNN he did but refused to release it.  Upon his exit, Schwarzenegger ordered all clemency files sealed for 25 years. (That's not necessarily unusual. Schwarzenegger's predecessor, Gray Davis, did the same thing.)  In his only comment about the case, Schwarzenegger told Newsweek, ""There's criticism out there. I think it's just because of our (Fabian Nunez) working relationship and all that. It maybe was kind of saying, 'That's why he did it.' Well, hello! I mean, of course you help a friend.""  Fabian Nunez told CNN he was told by Schwarzenegger that the comments were ""taken out of context."" Still, the Santos family attorney, Nina Solarno, was outraged.  ""He took a political favor and played God, and took justice away from this family,"" claimed Solarno, who is also a board member for the advocacy group Crime Victims United.  In a private letter to the Santos family, Schwarzenegger wrote: ""I recognize that the last minute nature of my final acts as Governor provided you no notice, no time to prepare for or absorb the impact of this decision. For that, I apologize.""  It was an apology the Santos family would not accept.  Taking on the Terminator  While Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Hollywood in 2011, Fred and Kathy Santos returned to court. Along with the San Diego County district attorney, they filed suit alleging Gov. Schwarzenegger violated ""Marsy's Law,"" which mandates that victims' families be given a right to speak in all proceedings related to their case.  It was the last chance Dumanis had to keep Esteban Nunez behind bars and repair the damage from what she considered a tremor shaking the entire system.  ""When a governor commutes a sentence in such a flagrantly political way, it puts everybody in the system on notice that their (deals) are not safe,"" Dumanis said.  While agreeing Schwarzenegger's move was ""grossly unjust"" and ""deserving of censure,"" two separate judges concluded that it was not illegal and that ""Marsy's Law"" applied to parole hearings, not executive clemency.  Schwarzenegger, for now, had won. But both the Santoses and San Diego prosecutors were not giving up.  They succeeded in changing the state law, which now requires California governors to give victims and prosecutors at least 10 days of notice before issuing clemency. That will ensure Luis Santos' case isn't repeated, but it won't keep Esteban Nunez from being released.  While the Santos family will next petition the state Supreme Court, they know time is running out.  ""Esteban is going to be out before we get to the Supreme Court,"" Solarno conceded. ""Now we want an acknowledgment that the family's rights were taken from them, that they should have been heard, and that from this day forward your case is setting precedent that other victims are going to be heard.""  Arnold Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN's requests for a formal interview, but when questioned by CNN at the ""Terminator Genysis"" premiere in June, he would not speak about the case.  ""Since we're here today for the movie promotion, we talk movies,"" he said.  ""That's the type of person he is,"" said Fred Santos. ""He thinks somebody being murdered -- it's news that is below his status.""  ""I get their pain,"" Fabian Nunez said, adding that his attempt to reach out to the Santos family wasn't accepted. ""I get to see my son, they don't get to see theirs ... but I make no apologies for fighting for justice for my son.""  For Rick Clabby, the vocal former prosecutor, the Santos family has been victimized too many times in this case.  ""They were victimized when their son was murdered, they were victimized when our office made this stupid decision and they were victimized when the governor buddied up with Mr. Nunez,"" Clabby told CNN.  But Fred and Kathy Santos say they'll continue to fight. They're not sure where it will lead them, but they know they have to keep trying.  ""We weren't there to protect Luis, to prevent him from being killed,"" Fred Santos said. ""This is the only thing we can do for him."""
E494,1,Obese Woman Arrested For Starving Her 7 Kids: “There Was Only Enough Food For Me”,"News 8 – A disturbing report is coming out of that Baton Rouge, Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors who reportedly starved her children nearly to death. The 27-year-old mother of 7 was arrested on Thursday evening when neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door, they were greeted by three-year-old Amonte Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who let them into the home. Authorities say they found the Lakisha Connors passed out on the couch.  “The house was disgusting, probably the worst I’ve ever seen,” said police chief Ronnie Hernandes. “When we enter the home, we found seven children who looked extremely malnourished. In addition to that there was a lock on the refrigerator and all nonperishable foods were locked in a huge wooden makeshift storage container in the mother’s bedroom.”  Neighbors say that Connors moved into this rental home about six weeks ago.  “Lakisha just moved in not too long ago. This was the first time I had ever seen any children!” said a neighbor who wishes to stay anonymous. “But we see her almost every day coming into the house with groceries. So for her children to be starting like that was absolutely shocking!”  Authorities on the scene say when Lakisha was awoke by the police, she was very combative. “We pulled her up off the couch and asked her to explain herself,” said Hernandes. “When asked why her children were in this condition, Lakisha plainly said, without any remorse, ‘There was only enough food for me! Them kids get on my nerves. But they eat, they eat my scraps. I’m a big girl I need more than them!'”  The 7 children, whose ages range from 1 to 11 years of age, were taken into protective custody by Child Protective Services.  Lakisha is currently being held on a $500 bond."

It reads:  “It’s clear that a misunderstanding occurred at a franchised 7-Eleven store. We understand that a customer presented a military ID as a form of identification when buying age-restricted products, and the Franchisee’s store associate could not clearly read the birth date. In this instance, the store associate, by law, was required to ask to see a second form of ID with a birthdate. After the customer’s age was verified, the transaction was completed. Serving members of the military, being named a top military-friendly company and employing military veterans are great honors for 7-Eleven.”  The owner of the Redmond West Lake Sammamish Parkway 7-Eleven sent this response on Thursday, calling the incident a misunderstanding:  “We sincerely apologize for a misunderstanding that occurred at one of our stores.

pheme_42,1,"German Airbus crashes in French Alps with 150 dead, black box found","By Jean-Francois Rosnoblet SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren. Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board. One of the plane's black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France's interior minister said. In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation. Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines. ""We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,"" Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter. Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain's deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard. Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said. Barcelona's Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner's Siegfried at the theater. French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms. Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. ""We are still searching. It's unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,"" regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters. In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: ""A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors."" It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets. It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday's crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December. SHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes. ""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference. Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday. Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky. France's DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus. ""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a DGAC spokesman said. In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground. The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby. STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in. “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a ""dark day for Lufthansa"". ""My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,"" Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there. Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff. In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. ""The families knew each other,"" he told Reuters. ""The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning."" King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened. In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the ""awful tragedy"". Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran.

According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.  While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.  Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.  Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.  “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”  Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.  The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.  Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.  The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death."

E659,1,Republicans Escalate Their War On Women To Attack Wounded Female Veterans,"The most anti-woman Republican Party in American History escalated its attacks on women to deny wounded female veterans fertility treatments that would help them to have children in spite of wounds suffered while defending our country.    The Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act, a bill authored by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) that would require fertility treatment and counseling for ""severely wounded, ill, or injured"" military members or veterans, had been expected to proceed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday. But Murray said she has asked that the bill be pulled thanks to proposed amendments from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) -- including one that would have, in Tillis's words, prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from working with ""organizations that take human aborted babies' organs and sell them.""  Tillis, of course, is referring to the fraudulent and debunked video recorded in secret by other Republican operatives which claims to show Planned Parenthood officials engaged in the sale of fetal tissue. It does not matter to Tillis--or any Republican, it seems-- that the video was edited to deliberately deceive. It provides a ready excuse for Republican males to exercise control over women's bodies any way they possibly can, even if it means denying wounded women veterans the ability to have children. Republicans have seized on the altered and edited video as a bludgeon to carry on their attacks against Planned Parenthood, an organization they hate because it provides women with safe and legal family planning services, counseling, and assistance with terminating unwanted pregnancies.  In this case it's hard to tell whom Republicans hate more, women or veterans. Either way, the irony of denying women the ability to conceive by pandering to the anti-choice lobby seems to have been lost on Mr. Tillis and his Republican cohorts. To illustrate just how cynical and petty his rationale is, Tillis points to a $900 donation made by the VA to a group that he can't even identify as Planned Parenthood, as ""justification"" for blocking this funding:    Tillis cited a report by Congress' nonpartisan Government Accountability Office on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending for family planning and other health programs by six organizations, including Planned Parenthood. In a footnote, that report said the VA had spent $900 on one of the organizations, but it did not say which one had received the money.  A $900 donation, out of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is how extreme they are.  Senator Murray reacted with anger and dismay at the derailing of her legislation:    ""I know some Republicans are trying to use this latest issue as just one more opportunity to roll back the clock and take away women’s health care options,"" Murray said. ""We can have that fight. We’ve had it many times before. But don’t pull veterans into the middle of it. Don’t take something that should be above politics -- our sacred duty to our veterans -- and pull it down into the muck of petty politics. It’s not fair to veterans and their families, who have been hoping and praying for the opportunity to have children.""  Paralyzed Veterans of America is deeply disappointed to learn that S. 469, the 'Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act,' has been pulled from the Senate VA Committee markup this afternoon due to amendments that serve no function but histrionic political grandstanding. Shame on those who have placed political ideology ahead of the needs of veterans with catastrophic disabilities, particularly those with spinal cord injury or disease.  This bipartisan, critically needed legislation would lift an antiquated ban on VA providing fertility services to veterans who have incurred a severe injury to their reproductive organs. As a result of the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, many young service members have suffered grievous injuries from explosive devices that have made them unable to conceive a child naturally. While the Department of Defense does provide assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to service members, VA does not.  "

E452,0,Kentucky clerk defies Supreme Court on same-sex marriage and could be held in contempt,"When Kim Davis ran her election campaign to replace her mother as Rowan County Clerk in Kentucky, she often argued that the public needed a seamless transition because services including marriage licenses “cannot stop or slow down.” Davis was narrowly elected in 2014 to the top job in the office where she had worked for more than 25 years, rising to become her mom’s principal deputy.  On Tuesday, Davis derailed those services at the clerk’s office in Morehead, Ky., by refusing to issue marriage licenses to all couples -- gay and straight -- because her religious beliefs prohibit same-sex marriage. During a chaotic morning she argued that God gave her the authority to defy even the nation’s highest court, which refused to get involved in the current case after it upheld gay marriage in June.  “To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience,” she said in a prepared statement issued through her attorneys, the Liberty Counsel, based in Orlando, Fla. “It is not a light issue for me. It is a heaven or hell decision.”  A federal judge has set a Thursday hearing to decide whether Davis and her top aides should be held in contempt of court to force them to issue marriage licenses. Davis could be personally fined or even face jail, though the plaintiffs say they just want their marriage license.  Advertisement  The battle has echoes from the days of the African American civil rights struggles of the 1960s when Southern officials refused to follow court rulings on integration. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that same-sex marriage was a constitutional right, most people thought the issue was resolved.  And in most places, it was, except in a handful of counties in Texas, Alabama and Kentucky, where local officials chose to stop issuing all marriage licenses to avoid granting licenses to same-sex couples.  Lawsuits were filed in several of the states, including against Davis, who stopped issuing licenses days after the Supreme Court decision. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her, arguing that because she was an elected official she was required to issue the documents despite her religious beliefs. Davis claims she is protected by the state’s version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, designed to protect religious expression.  Federal District Judge David L. Bunning disagreed, ruling against the clerk. Last week, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Bunning.  “It cannot be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County Clerk’s office, apart from who personally occupies that office, may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution as interpreted by a dispositive holding of the United States Supreme Court,” the appeals court said.  On Monday, the Supreme Court in a one-line order rejected Davis’ appeal, ending the clerk’s legal fight. It was the first time the court had to deal with a gay marriage issue since its June ruling.  Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who has followed the same-sex marriage issue, said that although a number of clerks around the country say they are uncomfortable issuing licenses, the Rowan County case is the only one to have advanced so far in the courts.  “My reading is that the Supreme Court was pretty clear in late June about the notion of marriage equality,” he said. “I don’t think the religious freedom argument is that strong in this situation.”  Advertisement  The high court’s action also set the scene for Tuesday’s confrontation in Morehead, where Davis turned away several gay and lesbian couples who sought marriage licenses.  It was the third time that David Moore and David Ermold had sought a license from Davis. In televised video of their encounter, Davis told the couple to leave.  “We’re not leaving until we have a license,” Ermold responded.  “Then you’re going to have a long day,” Davis replied.  Advertisement  Davis then retreated into her inner office and closed the blinds, seeking shelter from media cameras and rival demonstrations.  “Praise the Lord!” her supporters shouted. “Stand your ground!”  Other activists yelled, “Do your job!”  The mainly rural county, about 60 miles east of Lexington, has about 23,000 residents.  Advertisement  Davis’ mother served as county clerk for 37 years and her son also works in the clerk’s office.  “I love my job and the people of Rowan County,” Davis stated. “I have never lived any place other than Rowan County. Some people have said I should resign, but I have done my job well.”  Davis’ husband, Joe, told reporters that his wife has received death threats. He said he believed in the 2nd Amendment and was not afraid: “I’m an old redneck hillbilly, that’s all I’ve got to say. Don’t come knocking on my door.”  He pointed to the gay rights protesters gathered outside and said: “They want us to accept their beliefs and their ways. But they won’t accept our beliefs and our ways.”  Advertisement  Davis was elected as a Democrat and has been supported by others including Casey County Clerk Casey Davis, who is riding his bicycle across the state in support of his fellow officeholder. His county is not issuing any marriage license either to avoid the same-sex marrraige issue, and he wants a special session of the Kentucky Legislature to deal with the whole issue.  “Kim Davis is my spiritual sister,” he said, breathing heavily, in a telephone interview from near Elizabethtown, Ky.  “I just climbed a real tall hill in Kentucky to help raise awareness about what is happening to Kim Davis,” he said. “She is a lady and not deserving of going to jail or being fined. All she is trying to do is to live her life as a Christian and that should be her right.”  ALSO:  Advertisement  U.S. stocks plummet; Dow sinks below correction threshold  Video shows deputies shooting San Antonio man whose hands were raised  Northern Illinois police officer is shot and killed"
politifact13352,0,Donald Trump Sets Conditions for Defending NATO Allies Against Attack,"CLEVELAND — Donald J. Trump, on the eve of accepting the Republican nomination for president, explicitly raised new questions on Wednesday about his commitment to automatically defending NATO allies if they are attacked, saying he would first look at their contributions to the alliance.  Asked about Russia’s threatening activities, which have unnerved the small Baltic States that are among the more recent entrants into NATO, Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have “fulfilled their obligations to us.”  “If they fulfill their obligations to us,” he added, “the answer is yes.”  Mr. Trump’s statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United States’ defense of its major allies. It was consistent, however, with his previous threat to withdraw American forces from Europe and Asia if those allies fail to pay more for American protection.  Mr. Trump also said he would not pressure Turkey or other authoritarian allies about conducting purges of their political adversaries or cracking down on civil liberties. The United States, he said, has to “fix our own mess” before trying to alter the behavior of other nations."

E124,0,OUTRAGE: Obama Gave ISIS 45 Minute Warning Before Bombing Oil Tankers!,"CRIME STORY: Obama Gave ISIS 45 Minute Warning Before Bombing Oil Tankers! Click to Tweet  The Obama White House is giving ISIS a 45 minute warning before bombing their oil tankers by dropping leaflets advising potential jihadists to flee before air strikes in Syria.  “Get out of your trucks now, and run away from them. Warning: air strikes are coming. Oil trucks will be destroyed. Get away from your oil trucks immediately. Do not risk your life,” the leaflet reads.  The leaflet drops are justified under the premise that the oil tanker drivers might be civilians and not ISIS recruits, although it’s an explanation that doesn’t wash with critics.  “It’s not like these drivers are innocent, uninvolved “civilians” like children or sick people,” writes J.E. Dyer. “They’re waging ISIS’s war, just like the other non-uniformed participants who make up 100% of ISIS’s ranks. This is how far the Obama administration is going to avoid “collateral damage” — and who knows, it may be worse.”  FrontPageMag’s Daniel Greenfield makes a similar point, commenting, “So after all this time, they came up with a great plan; drop flyers on ISIS trucks so that the drivers, who may or may not be ISIS members, can run away in time. Meanwhile ISIS gets 45 minutes of warning.”  Compare the Obama White House’s approach to fighting ISIS to that of Russia.  While it took the U.S. fifteen months to even begin targeting ISIS’ oil refineries and tankers, air strikes by Moscow destroyed more than 1,000 tankers in a period of just five days.  In comparison, Col. Steve Warren said that the U.S. had taken out only 116 tanker trucks, the “first strike” to target ISIS’ lucrative black market oil business, which funds over 50 per cent of the terror group’s activities.  U.S. air strikes targeting ISIS oil assets are so rare that PBS was caught using footage of Russian fighter jets bombing an oil storage facility in Syria and passing it off as evidence of the U.S. targeting the Islamic State’s oil infrastructure.  U.S. military pilots have also confirmed that they were ordered not to drop 75 per cent of their ordnance on ISIS targets because they could not get clearance from their superiors.  “You went 12 full months while ISIS was on the march without the U.S. using that air power and now as the pilots come back to talk to us they say three-quarters of our ordnance we can’t drop, we can’t get clearance even when we have a clear target in front of us,” said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif, while retired four-star U.S. general Jack Keane labeled the policy ” an absurdity from the beginning.”  Numerous analysts claim that the Obama White House’s fifteen month wait before it began targeting the primary funding mechanism behind ISIS was part of a tacit policy to help the Islamic State overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad."
politifact12418,0,Clinton's Lead Over Trump Shrinks to 3 Points: New NBC News/WSJ Poll,"Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points — resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.  Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.  In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.  Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).  Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).  The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.  Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.  Complete Coverage: Decision 2016  While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton’s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.  Mr. and Mrs. Unpopular  Trump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.  Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) — a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month.  Trump's rating is even worse than Clinton’s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) — an improvement from his minus-41 score in April.  “This has never been matched, or even close to being matched,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.  By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clinton’s rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); Sanders’ rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31).  President Obama’s overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8).  Forty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate  Asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012.  Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.  The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline. The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points."
E451,0,"Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis Defies Supreme Court, Turns Down Gay Couples","Defying the Supreme Court and invoking “God’s authority,” a Kentucky county clerk on Tuesday turned away two same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses — and then was summoned to federal court.  Kim Davis, the clerk for Rowan County, who says that her personal Christian objections preclude her from issuing licenses to gay couples, declined the licenses to two men and two women.  She said in a statement that it was not a “gay or lesbian issue” but a “Heaven or Hell decision.”  “To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience,” she said.  She said would not resign.  In the clerk’s office, supporters of Davis shouted “Praise the Lord!” and supporters of the couples called her a bigot and shouted “Do your job!” after she declined the licenses. Sheriff’s deputies cleared the room, and demonstrations continued outside.  The Supreme Court refused to intervene on Monday, leaving in place a ruling from a federal judge that ordered Davis to keep issuing marriage licenses while she presses her case in the courts, claiming a religious objection to performing her official duties.  The judge summoned Davis and her deputies to a hearing on Thursday. Couples who have sued Davis for marriage licenses asked that she be held in contempt and fined, but not thrown in jail.  The legal drama escalated after a confrontation Tuesday morning in the clerk’s office. Davis denied marriage licenses to April Miller and Karen Roberts and to David Moore and David Ermold.  Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis talks with David Moore after refusing him and David Ermold a marriage license. Timothy D. Easley / AP  With a crush of TV cameras behind them, Moore and Ermold, confronted her across a desk.  ""I'm not being disrespectful to you,"" Davis told Moore.  ""You absolutely are,"" he said. ""You're treating us like second-class citizens, is what you're doing.""  He later asked whether she would deny a marriage license to an interracial couple.  ""A man and a woman? No,"" she said. She added that she was acting ""under God's authority.""  After the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide on June 26, Gov. Steve Beshear ordered all the state’s clerks to comply immediately. Davis, saying she did not want to discriminate, stopped issuing all marriage licenses.  A federal judge ordered her to issue them, and an appeals court agreed. The Supreme Court's rejection of Davis' appeal was the first legal skirmish to reach the justices since the landmark marriage ruling in June.  The contempt request was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky on behalf of couples, both same-sex and opposite-sex, who sued Davis.  Related: Why Hasn't Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis Been Fired?  ""Since Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,"" lawyers wrote, ""plaintiffs urge the Court to impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous to compel Davis’ immediate compliance without further delay."""

Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.”  At the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the world’s largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines.  To aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement – close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally.  UNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities.  UNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission.  “Resettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,” said Pitterman."

Because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five, and if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you.    Here's number five. Pull up your pants. Some people, a lot of them black, gave me flak for saying that recently on ""The Wendy Williams Show.""    (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)    LEMON: If you're sagging, I mean -- I think it's your self-esteem that is sagging and who you are as a person it's sagging. Young people need to be taught respect and there are rules.    (END VIDEOTAPE)    LEMON: Sagging pants, whether Justin Bieber or No-name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not OK. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoners so that they can't make a weapon. And then it evolved into which role a prisoner would have during male-on-male prison sex. The one with the really low pants is the submissive one. You get my point?    Number four now is the n-word. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    JAY-Z, RAPPER: For our generation what we did was we took the word and we took the power out of that word.    CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: We took this word, and we made it into poetry.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    LEMON: I understand poetic license, but consider this: I hosted a special on the n-word, suggesting that black people stop using it and that entertainers stop deluding yourselves or themselves and others that you're somehow taking the word back.    (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)    LEMON: By promoting the use of that word when it's not germane to the conversation, have you ever considered that you may be just perpetuating the stereotype the master intended acting like a nigger?    (END VIDEOTAPE)    LEMON: A lot of African-Americans took offense to that, too. I wonder if I gave the right advice, I really did. But confirmation came the very next day on my way home when I exited the subway in 125th Street in Harlem. This little kid in a school uniform no older than seven years old, he was crying his eyes out as he walked down the sidewalk with his mother.    I'm going to be honest here, she turned to me, and she said ""I'm sick of you. You act like an old ass man, stop all that crying, nigger."" Is that taking the word back? Think about that.    Now number three. Respect where you live. Start small by not dropping trash, littering in your own communities. I've lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life, I rarely, if ever, witnessed people littering. I live in Harlem now, it's an historically black neighborhood, every single day I see adults and children dropping their trash on the ground when a garbage can is just feet away. Just being honest here.    Number two, finish school. You want to break the cycle of poverty? Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money.    And number one, and probably the most important, just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should. Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues. So, please, black folks, as I said if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior. Pay close attention to the hip-hop and rap culture that many of you embrace. A culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you. And it's not going to. That said, though, the political right is not off the hook.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    KRISTEN POWERS, DAILY BEAST COLUMNIST: If conservatives are so concerned about black-on-black crime, it's a little concerning the only time I hear them talking about it is when they want to stick it to the black community.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    LEMON: And that's today's ""No Talking Points."""
politifact2758,0,"In Weekly Republican Address, Boehner Calls For “New Way Forward” Focused on Creating Jobs, Cutting Spending, & Reforming Congress","With Americans demanding a new way forward in Washington, House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) uses the Weekly Republican Address to outline solutions for ending economic uncertainty, stopping government’s spending binge, and changing the way Congress does business. In the address, Boehner notes that this is a new approach that hasn’t been tried in Washington – by either party – and it is at the core of the Pledge to America, a governing agenda Republicans built by listening to the people.    Leader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of Boehner’s remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading.    “Hello. I’m John Boehner.    “Before I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs.    “In the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to ‘change this country and change the world.’    “Well I don’t know about the world, but here at home, Americans haven’t experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low.    “These problems didn’t start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A ‘stimulus’ spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care.    “All these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt.    “Americans are demanding a new way forward in Washington – an approach that neither party has tried.    “It starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again.  “That’s what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people.    “A generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, we’re now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids.    “This spending spree threatens our children’s future. It’s also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. We’re ready to cut spending to pre-‘stimulus,’ pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And we’re ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge.    “We need to stop the coming tax hike. We can’t balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth – and we won’t have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families.    “There’s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that’s change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them – something they didn’t get when the ‘stimulus’ was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called ‘comprehensive’ bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view – not written in the Speaker’s office, behind closed doors.    “Across our nation, Americans are looking at President Obama’s policies and asking – ‘where are the jobs?’ To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending – and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself.    “This is a new way forward that hasn’t been tried in Washington yet. It’s a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, it’s also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less.    “Together, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people.    “These ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America.    “We’ve tried it President Obama’s way. We’ve tried it Washington’s way. It hasn’t worked. It’s time to put the people back in charge.    “Thank you for your time and may God bless the United States of America."""

E219,0,43 Washington and Oregon Chipotle Restaurants Closed After E. Coli Outbreak,"More than 40 Chipotle restaurants across Oregon and Washington state were closed Saturday after an E. coli outbreak was linked to some of the chain's locations in those states, according to health officials.  Nineteen E. coli cases in Washington and three in Oregon have been connected to Chipotle, according to the Washington State Department of Health.  ""While the outbreak appears to be linked to food served at Chipotle restaurants, the food or other source of contamination hasn’t yet been determined and remains under investigation,"" the department said.  Eight of those who got sick were hospitalized, the department said. No one has died as a result of the outbreak.  ""Anyone who thinks they may have become ill from eating at a Chipotle restaurant in the past three weeks should consult their healthcare provider,"" epidemiologist Dr. Scott Lindquist said in a Washington Health Department statement.  Chris Arnold, Chipotle's communications director, said in a statement that the people who got sick ate at six different Chipotle restaurants. ""The safety and wellbeing of our customers is always our highest priority,"" he said. ""We offer our deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by this situation.""  Once the company was notified of the E. coli outbreak, ""we immediately closed all of our restaurants in the area out of an abundance of caution, even though the vast majority of these restaurants have no reported problems,"" the statement said.  Chipotle is working with health officials to determine what caused the issue, the statement said  Arnold told NBC News that a total of 43 Chipotle restaurants were shuttered and the ""reopening schedule will be driven by progress of the investigation.""  Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some strains can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, pneumonia and other illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The closures came at an inopportune time for Chipotle and fans of the Mexican food chain, as the restaurants usually hold a promotion on Halloween. This year, customers who came in costume with an added off-theme accessory could score a $3 ""boorito."" The stunt was meant to raise awareness about food additives."
E471,0,"In Honor of Peace Day, Burger King Proposes One-Off ‘McWhopper’ Collaboration with McDonald’s","MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It’s official. Burger King is extending an olive branch to McDonald’s, calling for a one-day ‘burger wars’ ceasefire on their longstanding rivalry. Burger King proposes that on Peace Day, September 21st, 2015, the two restaurants set aside their differences and unite to create the ‘McWhopper’ - a burger that combines all the tastiest ingredients from their signature sandwiches, the Big Mac® and the WHOPPER®, in one delicious, peace-loving burger.  A detailed exploration of Burger King’s proposal to McDonald’s can be found at www.mcwhopper.com. The ‘McWhopper’ would be available for one-day, at one location in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A., with the objective of raising awareness of Peace Day. As with any proposal, McDonald’s is free to accept or decline the offer. If they choose not to participate, no harm done - after all, peace isn’t always easy to achieve. Should they say yes, burger fans will get to experience the culinary mash-up of a lifetime, and walk away inspired by the mouthwatering taste of peace.  “Our proposal is designed to generate the most attention and awareness possible for Peace Day and the work of the non-profit organization Peace One Day,” said Fernando Machado, Senior Vice President for Global Brand Management at Burger King Corporation. “We’re being completely transparent with our approach because we want them to take this seriously. It would be amazing if McDonald’s agrees to do this. Let’s make history and generate a lot of noise around Peace Day. If they say no, we’ll hopefully have, at the very least, raised much-needed financial support and consciousness for the great cause that is Peace One Day. And both are well worth the effort.”  Peace Day, September 21st, is a United Nations-recognized annual day of global unity, successfully advocated by the non-profit organization Peace One Day. “Our short term goal is to expose three billion people to Peace Day by 2016. It’s a big target but it’s very possible, particularly with the support of the corporate sector – they have the resources and ability to raise awareness on a massive scale. That awareness creates action, and that action saves lives,” said Jeremy Gilley, founder of Peace One Day. “This proposal from Burger King is the corporate sector at its best – coming together, putting their differences aside and saying: ‘come on; let’s do something to manifest a more peaceful, sustainable world’.”  For more information, visit www.mcwhopper.com and www.peaceoneday.org.

About Peace One Day  Founded in 1999 by filmmaker Jeremy Gilley, the non-profit organisation Peace One Day drove the initiative that led to the unanimous adoption by the United Nations member states of an annual day of global ceasefire and non-violence on 21 September – Peace Day.  Not only has Peace Day been proved as a catalyst for broad-ranging civil society action by individuals and groups in every country of the world, but also for life-saving activities: notably, in 2007, Jeremy Gilley and Peace One Day Ambassador Jude Law travelled to Afghanistan to help develop and document preparations for life-saving activities across the country for Peace Day. As a result of this work, since 2007, Peace Day agreements in the region have resulted in the immunisation against polio of 4.5 million children.  With the day well-established, Peace One Day’s objective is to institutionalise Peace Day around the world, making it self-sustaining. A report supported by McKinsey & Company estimated that 1 billion people were exposed to the Peace Day message in 2014 with around 610 million people fully aware and engaged, resulting in 10 million people behaving more peacefully. Peace One Day aims to reach 3 billion people with the Peace Day message by Peace Day 2016. For more information, visit www.peaceoneday.org."

E316,0,Guns have killed more preschoolers than police officers in the line of duty,"Guns for sale are displayed in Roseburg Gun Shop in Roseburg Thomson Reuters  New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof made waves with a single sentence in a recent op-ed on how the US could reduce gun deaths:  In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI.  Kristof wasn't wrong.  While the number of police officers feloniously killed with a firearm in 2013 was actually 26 — the 27th was killed by a vehicle — Kristof highlights a troubling data point.  What's more is that 2013 wasn't an outlier. From 1999 through 2013, preschoolers — children aged zero to 4 — have been killed by guns in greater numbers than police officers in the line of duty, with the exception of 2004, when the groups were tied at 58 deaths.  Children aged 5 to 9 also outnumber police officers for gun deaths for every year in that period.  Here are our findings, drawing on data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI's ""Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted"" reports, and the FBI's ""Crime in the United States"" reports:  Business Insider/Dan Turkel  When examining cumulative deaths from 1999 onward, the results are the same. From 1999 to 2013, 1,120 children zero to 4 and 1,047 children 5 to 9 were killed with guns compared to only 766 police officers.  Business Insider/Dan Turkel  Readers can also access interactive versions of the above graphs: yearly and cumulative.  It should be noted that the population sizes for these groups are different.  In 2013, the CDC estimated a population of 19,868,088 children zero to 4, meaning that the 82 gun deaths in that group constitute a rate of 0.41 deaths per 100,000. In comparison, the FBI counted 626,942 full-time law-enforcement officers in the same year, so the 28 gun deaths in that group constitute a rate of about 4.5 deaths per 100,000, just over 10 times the size of the preschooler rate.  Some might argue that police officers should be safer from gun violence because they carry firearms. It is difficult to estimate how many officer killings were prevented by an officer's use of his or her firearm, but in the data we analyzed, nearly half of officers feloniously killed in the line of duty didn't use their weapon at all.  In fact, 7.8% of officers feloniously killed by a firearm were killed with their own weapon."
E42,0,Judge Calls For US Marshals and FBI To Arrest Congress and The President,"On November 28th, 2015, Alaska State Judge Anna von Reitz (Anna Maria Riezinger) addressed an open letter to all federal agents, including the FBI and US Marshals to arrest Congress, the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. She goes into incredible detail on the fraud that has been committed. Anyone who reads this is sure to learn at least something. Below is the text and you can open the original pdf here. This has been encouraged to be shared widely.  Anna Maria Riezinger (Anna Von Reitz)  November 28, 2015 Big Lake,  Alaska Dear Federal Agents:  I am addressing this letter in this way, because it is my understanding that it will be read by members of both the FBI and the US Marshals Service. It is also my understanding that you have available for examination a wet-ink signed copy of the illustrated affidavit of probable cause entitled “You Know Something Is Wrong When…..An American Affidavit of Probable Cause” as back-up reference and evidence.  Since the publication of the affidavit a plethora of new supporting documentation and evidence has come to light. We found, for example, that on June 30, 1864, the members of Congress acting as the Board of Directors of a private, mostly foreign-owned corporation doing business as “The United States of America, Incorporated” changed the meaning of “state”, “State” and “United States” to mean “District of Columbia Municipal Corporation”. Like the 1862 change of the meaning of the word “person” to mean “corporation” cited in our affidavit, these special coded meanings of words render a drastically different picture of the world around us.  It turns out that your “personal bank account” is actually a “corporate bank account”. The “Colorado State Court” is actually the “Colorado District of Columbia Municipal Corporation Court”. If you are shocked to learn these facts, you are not alone. So are millions of other Americans. These changes were made 150 years ago and tucked away in reams of boring meeting minutes and legalistic gobbledygook meant to be applied only to the internal workings of a private governmental services corporation and its employees.  There was no public announcement, just as there was no public announcement or explanation when Congress created “municipal citizenship” known as “US citizenship” in 1868. Properly, technically, even to this day, this form of “citizenship” applies only to those born in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and other Insular States, so there was no real reason to educate the general public about the topic. As Congress was secretively using the labor and the private property assets of these “citizens” as collateral backing the corporate debts of “The United States of America, Inc.” there was plenty of reason to obscure this development.  At the end of the Civil War it would have been very unpopular to reveal that they were simply changing gears from private sector slave ownership to public sector slave ownership. You may be surprised to learn that slavery was not abolished by the Thirteenth or any other Amendment to any constitution then or now. Instead, slavery was redefined as the punishment meted out to criminals. Look it up and read it for yourselves. It remains perfectly legal to enslave criminals, and it was left to Congress to define who the criminals were, because Congress was given plenary power over the District of Columbia and its citizenry by the original Constitution of the Republic and could do whatever it liked within the District and the Washington, DC Municipalities.  A child picking dandelions on the sidewalk could be arbitrarily defined as a criminal and enslaved for life by the renegade Congress functioning as the government of the District of Columbia and as the Board of Directors for the District of Columbia Municipal Corporation, but for starters, Congress simply defined “US citizens” as debt slaves under the 14th Amendment of their corporation’s articles and by-laws—-which they deceptively named the “Constitution of the United States of America”.  The actual Constitution was and still is called “The Constitution for the united States of America”, but most people untrained in the Law and trusting what they believed to be their government didn’t notice the difference between “The Constitution for the united States of America” and the “Constitution of the United States of America”. Are you beginning to see a pattern of deliberate deceit and self-interest and double-speak and double-dealing? And are you also beginning to catch the drift—the motivation—behind it? Let’s discuss the concept of “hypothecation of debt”.  This little gem was developed by the bankers who actually owned and ran the governmental services corporations doing business as “The United States of America, Inc.” and as the “United States, Incorporated”. When you hypothecate debt against someone or against some asset belonging to someone else, you simply claim that they agreed to stand as surety for your debt — similar to cosigning a car loan — and as long as you make your payments, nobody is any the wiser. Normally, it’s not possible for us to just arbitrarily claim that someone is our surety for debt without proof of consent, but that is exactly what Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Conference of Governors did in March of 1933.  They named all of us and all our property as surety standing good for the debts of their own bankrupt governmental services corporation during bankruptcy reorganization—-and got away with it by claiming that they were our “representatives” and that we had delegated our authority to them to do this “for” us. The exact date and occasion when this happened and where it is recorded, is given in our affidavit. In order to pull this off, however, they had to allege that we were all “US citizens”, and therefore, all subject to the plenary power of Congress acting as an oligarchy ruling over the District of Columbia and the Federal Territories.  They did this by abusing the public trust and creating and registering millions of foreign situs trusts named after each of us. Under their own diversity of citizenship rules, corporations are considered to be “US citizens”. So they created all these foreign situs trusts as franchises of their own bankrupt corporation, used our names styled like this: John Quincy Adams—-and placed commercial liens against our names as chattel owned by their corporation and standing as surety for its debts. A group of thugs elected to political office grossly transgressed against the American people and the American states and committed the crime of personage against each and every one of us without us ever being aware of it.  They couldn’t enslave us, but they could enslave a foreign situs trust named after us— that we conveniently didn’t know existed— and by deliberately confusing this “thing” with us via the misuse of our given names, they could bring charges against what appeared to be us and our private property in their very own corporate tribunals. And so the fleecing of America began in earnest. The hirelings had our credit cards, had stolen our identities, and were ready to begin a crime spree unheralded in human history.  They claimed that we all knew about this arrangement and consented to it, because we “voluntarily” gave up our gold when FDR sent his henchmen around to collect it—-when as millions of Americans can attest, people gave up their gold in preference to being shot or having to kill federal agents. They chose life for everyone concerned over some pieces of metal, and for that, they are to be honored; unfortunately, their decision gave the rats responsible an excuse to claim that Americans wanted to leave the gold standard and wanted the “benefits” of this New Deal in “equitable exchange” for their gold, their identities, the abuse of their good names as bankrupts and debtors, the loss of allodial title to their land and homes, and their subjection as slaves to the whims of Congress.  According to them—that is, those who benefited from this gross betrayal of the public trust— we all voluntarily left the Republic and the guarantees of the actual Constitution behind, willingly subjected ourselves to Congressional rule, donated all our assets including our labor and property to the Public Charitable Trust (set up after the Civil War as a welfare trust for displaced plantation slaves), and agreed to live as slaves owned by the District of Columbia Municipal Corporation in exchange for what? Welfare that we paid for ourselves. Social Security that we paid for ourselves.  The criminality of the “US Congress” and the “Presidents” acting since 1933 is jawdroppingly shocking. Their abuse of the trust of the American people is even worse. They have portrayed this circumstance as a political choice instead of an institutionalized fraud scheme, and they have “presumed” that we all went along with it and agreed to it without complaint. Thus, they have been merrily and secretively having us declared “civilly dead” as American State Citizens the day we are born, and entering a false registration claiming that we are “US Citizens” instead. We are told, when we wake up enough to ask, that we are free to choose our political status.  We don’t have to serve as debt slaves. We can go back and reclaim our guaranteed Republican form of government and our birthright status if we want to—- but that requires a secret process in front of the probate court and expatriation from the Federal United States to the Continental United States and all sorts of voo-doo in backrooms that can only be pursued by the few and the knowledgeable and the blessed. Everyone else has to remain as a debt slave and chattel serving whatever corporation bought the latest version of corporate “persona” named after us.  So let me ask you, as members of the FBI and as US Marshals—- does this sound like something you want to be involved with enforcing on innocent people, or does it sound like something you want to end as expeditiously as possible? The frauds that took root in the wake of the Civil War and which blossomed in the 1930’s have come to their final fruition.  Employees of the “District of Columbia Municipal Corporation” and its United Nations successors are being used as jack-booted thugs to throw Americans into privately owned “federal correctional facilities” when those who need correction—- the members of the American Bar Association and the euphemistically named and privately owned and operated “DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE”—continue to ignore the fact that Americans DO have a choice and that by the millions we are demanding our freedom from all these pathetic false commercial claims and presumptions.  We are standing up before the whole world and telling these privately owned “governmental services corporations” to go bankrupt like any other corporation that doesn’t do its job and mind its budget. These entities deserve to go bankrupt and worse. They have spent money and credit that was never theirs to spend. They have defrauded millions if not billions of innocent people and they have prevented Americans from claiming their birthrights for far too long.  These people— the members of Congress and the various “Presidents” of the numerous “United States” corporations — have acted as criminals. They deserve to be recognized as such. The members of the American Bar Association have attempted to wash their hands while profiting from the situation and obstructing justice. They stand around shrugging and saying, “Well, it’s a political choice. We don’t have anything to say about that.”—–yet at the same time, they refuse to correct the probate records to reflect our chosen change of political status when we plainly identify ourselves and enunciate our Will for them.  They, too, deserve to be recognized as self-interested criminals and accomplices to identity theft, credit fraud, and worse— which is why we have recently issued a $279 trillion dollar commercial obligation lien against the American Bar Association, the International Bar Association, and the DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. All our assets— our bodies, homes, businesses, lands, and labor—have been signed over into the “Public Charitable Trust” by con men merely claiming to represent us. Then, when we object to their lies and entrapment, they use the same fraud against us as their excuse for bringing more false claims against us and throwing us in jail. Enough is enough.  The British Monarch and the Lords of the Admiralty have promoted this fraud against us at the same time they have claimed to be our trustees, allies and friends in perpetuity. It’s time to clear the way for us to politely and peaceably exit from any presumption that we are or ever were “US citizens”, willing participants in the “Public Charitable Trust”, or willing “sureties” for the debts of any private bank-run governmental services corporation merely calling itself the United States of Something or Other.  We repudiate any presumption of private municipal citizenship or obligation to the District of Columbia Municipal Corporation or any successor thereof, and demand an immediate and permanent correction of the civil record to reflect our birthright status as American State Citizens, nunc pro tunc.  As for you, as “Federal Agents”, you have a lot to think about. For starters— who really pays your paycheck? Is it the goons in Washington, DC? Or does it all come from the American people you are supposed to be serving? Do you believe for one moment that anyone just lined up and gave their gold to FDR voluntarily? Do you believe that anyone gave away all their property and the guarantees of the actual Constitution for the “privilege” of paying for Social Security? No? Wake up and smell the java and start doing your real jobs. If anyone complains—arrest him.  We are reopening the American Common Law Courts expressly for the purpose of settling disputes related to living people and their property assets in excess of $20 as mandated by the Seventh Amendment. We, the American people, are the ones holding absolute civil authority upon the land of the Continental United States, and we give you permission to arrest the members of Congress, the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any other politician or appointee pretending to speak for us so as to enslave us and bring false claims against us via this institutionalized fraud scheme.  We want it recognized for what it is and dismantled and repudiated tout de suite.

Do you understand? Is it now completely clear who the criminals are? Your actual employers and benefactors are being attacked and defrauded by criminals pretending to act as their elected representatives and accomplices in black robes who are serving as enforcers of this fraud for profit. This has been happening right under your noses. This whole circumstance has escaped broad scale public understanding because it was being pursued by private governmental services corporations owned and operated by international banking cartels who claimed that these “private arrangements” were none of the public’s business, despite the grotesque and far-ranging impact these cozy understandings have had upon the people of this and many other countries.  Let it be perfectly clear to you that the business of these private corporations has become our business because they have operated in violation of their charters, in violation of the treaties allowing their existence, and in violation of the National Trust. The American Bar Association and the Internal Revenue Service have both been owned and operated as private foreign bill collectors and trust administrators by Northern Trust, Inc., in violent conflict of interest. They are not professional associations, non-profits, nor units of government. They are con artists and privateers whose licenses expired as of September 1, 2013.  The United States Marshals Service is enabled to act in the capacity of constitutionally – sworn Federal Marshals and we invoke their office and service as such; failure to accept the public office means rejection of all authority related to us. The same may be said of the FBI. Either you do your jobs as constitutionally sworn public officers, or you act as private mall cops in behalf of the offending corporations and under color of law when you pretend to have any public authority or function.  This is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Judge Anna Maria Riezinger  Alaska State Superior Court  Image Credit"
E163,0,Lindsay Miller wins fight to wear pasta strainer on her head in ID photo,"A woman in Massachusetts earned the right to wear a colander on her head during her driver's license photo by telling officials she identifies as a 'Pastafarian'.  Lindsay Miller, a follower of the 'Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster' was originally denied by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, but the decision was soon overturned.  The RMV's website says that drivers are not allowed to wear hats or head covers in ID photos, unless they are worn for 'medical or religious reasons'.  Miller fought the initial decision banning her from wearing the strainer, and after an intervention by the American Humanist Association's Appignani Humanist Legal Center, she was granted the religious freedom that would allow here to be pictured with a colander on her head.  Lindsay Miller, a follower of the 'Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster' was originally denied by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles when she requested to wear a colander on her head for her driver's license photo. But the decision was soon overturned when she argued that she was wearing the strainer for religious reasons  'If people are given the right to wear religious garments in government ID photos, then this must extend to people who follow the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,' said David Niose, legal director of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center, told the Washington Times.  Patty DeJuneas, a member of the Secular Legal Society, which assists the American Humanist Association, helped Miller fight for her religious rights.  'The First Amendment applies to every person and every religion, so I was dismayed to hear that Lindsay had been ridiculed for simply seeking the same freedoms and protections afforded to people who belong to more traditional or theistic religions,' DeJuneas said in a statement, according to the Boston Globe.  'If people are given the right to wear religious garments in government ID photos, then this must extend to people who follow the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,' she added.  Though the RMV aggreed to allow Miller to wear the strainer in the photo, the organization did not have a comment on Friday.  Miller identifies as a Pastafarian and is a follower of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  'As a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, I feel delighted that my Pastafarianism has been respected by the Massachusetts RMV,' Miller said Friday in a statement.  She added: 'While I don't think the government can involve itself in matters of religion, I do hope this decision encourages my fellow Pastafarian Atheists to come out and express themselves as I have.'  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster 'came into the mainstream' in 2005, according to its website.  Though some see the religion as satire, the website stresses that it is in fact a real religion 'is legit, and backed by hard science. Anything that comes across as humor or satire is purely coincidental'.  The church claims that it is not making an anti-religion statement with its outlandish beliefs, but rather highlights the distinction between the beliefs other other religions and the value followers get from them.  'The fact that millions of people get something positive out of a religion – even if it is based in superstition – does mean something. But that's not to say it's True, only that it has Value,' the website states.  Miller is not the first Pastafarian to win the battle to honor the Flying Spaghetti Monster."
E52,0,Is Safyre Terry’s Christmas Wish a Scam?,"On Facebook today a little girl called's from NY had a burned face and someone wrote it would be nice if everyone sent her a card and then put her name and a P.O. box. I was wondering if this is true or is someone hoping that people will put money in the card and it isn't for the little girl but just a scam from someone hoping to cash in on people's hearts?  Christmas may be a time for giving, but it’s also a time for scams. Internet swindlers attempt to take advantage of people’s generosity during the holiday season with a variety of schemes. This is probably why some people looked at a request for Christmas cards for an 8-year-old burn victim named Safyre Terry with a skeptical eye.  The request was originally posted to Facebook by Kevin “Snapshot” Clark on 4 December 2015:  Facebook users who were skeptical about Clark’s request must have been a little extra wary when the account disappeared for a few hours on 8 December 2015. But this was not the result of any fraudulent activity:  Last night Facebook shut my page down 6 hours… probably because of all the Safyre stuff (I was getting 50/minute friend requests! )… anyways, I made a new page BUT now don’t need it. Ignore it. Today after I nap from working all night I’m meeting Liz Terry-Dolder and Safyre after she gets outta school at her PO BOX so we can all check her mail TOGETHER! *AND A REPORTER /PHOTOGRAPHER FROM THE SCHENECTADY GAZETTE WILL BE THERE TOO! PSYCHED!!!  The influx of activity on Clark’s page was likely due to Hulk Hogan’s sudden involvement in the project. On 8 December 2015, the wrestler shared Clark’s message with his loyal “maniacs”:  Alright maniacs let’s make Safyre’s Christmas Dream come true! All she wants is Christmas Cards from around the world, but a little extra Christmas magic wouldn’t hurt!  HH.  The outpouring of support for Safyre Terry has been covered by multiple TV stations and news publications. And while a fundraising page has been set up to cover medical bills (an aspect that occasionally sets off the scam alert) this is a legitimate attempt to raise money for a young girl who suffered through a terrible ordeal.  On 2 May 2013, Terry survived a fire that killed her father and three siblings:  Elizabeth Dolder never imagined Safyre Terry’s stubborn ways might one day serve the girl well in her battle to stay alive. “She was a stubborn child, but that stubbornness is helping her through this,” Dolder said of her niece. “She’s going to get through this. I can’t lose her, too.” The 5-year-old girl, the only child to survive a ferocious house fire in Schenectady during the early morning hours of May 2 that claimed the lives of three of her siblings and her father, remains hospitalized in critical condition with severe burns to her tiny body.  On 9 December 2015 Dodler, Terry’s sole guardian, sent a thank you message out to all of the people who sent Christmas cards and donations:  BELIEVE BELIEVE BELIEVE She did. When she said she can’t wait to fill up the card tree my response was I don’t think it’s gonna get filled up but I am sure we will get a few more cards. She BELIEVED and ALL of YOU are making it happen. THANK YOU…..FAITH LOVE HOPE TO ALL  Subsequent reports showed huge piles of letters and cards:  When this all began Sa'fyre wanted 100 Christmas cards. This is her latest delivery. Are you sitting down? I'll wait… Posted by John Gray Fox23 on Monday, December 14, 2015  On 15 December 2015, a nonprofit organization called Baking Memories 4 Kids, which uses funds from cookies they sell to send children with life-threatening conditions on free vacations with their families, surprised Safyre with a trip to Walt Disney World."
E242,0,Johnny Depp wants to buy the site of Wounded Knee massacre and give it back to the Native Americans,"Johnny Depp wants to buy the site of Wounded Knee massacre and give it back to the Native Americans    Johnny Depp has announced that he wants to buy Wounded Knee, a national historic landmark, and give it back to the Indian people.  In an interview with the Mail On Sunday , the actor revealed that he is ready to spend millions in order to give the Native American people control of the land that was the site of a brutal 1890 massacre.  ‘It’s very sacred ground and many atrocities were committed against the Sioux there,' he said in the interview.  Investment: Johnny Depp researched Native American history for his role as Tonto, the Indian sidekick to the Lone Ranger, but that attention to detail hasn't helped in the box office as it is being deemed a flop  Heritage: Depp announced that he would like to buy the site of Wounded Knee, an 1890 massacre that left hundreds of Native Americans dead, and return it to them  'And in the 1970s there was a stand-off between the Feds (Federal government) and the people who should own that land. This historical land is so important to the Sioux culture and all I want to do is buy it and give it back. Why doesn’t the government do that?’  Depp's interest in Native American culture was highlighted because of his role as Tonto, the Indian sidekick of the fictional Lone Ranger character.  He has spoken in depth about how he did exhaustive research about the various tribes and got the approval of many Native American groups before filming began.  ‘The main thing was, “Are we doing right by the Indian? Let’s not make any mistakes here.” The idea was to give back to them and to make sure that we got it right,' he said in the lengthy interview.  Just before: This picture of the Miniconjou Sioux band was taken near the site of the Wounded Knee massacre one month before the December 1890 massacre where hundreds of Indians were killed  Tragic: Chief Spotted Elk, (widely known by the somewhat derogatory nickname Big Foot) the leader of the Sioux, is seen here as he lay frozen in the ground after the fighting at Wounded Knee. The legendary leader died in that battle with American troops  ‘The production was blessed by the Navajo and the Comanche and I got a call from LaDonna Harris, who has been a Comanche activist for many years, to say that she wanted to adopt me into her family and into the Comanche nation. It’s a great honor.’  Moneybags: Depp commands $20m per film and is thought to have a fortune of several hundred million dollars  That blessing did not extended to the box office, however.  The Lone Ranger opened on July 3 and is estimated to lose between $150million and $200million due to the film's $215million production budget and additional $175million for marketing.  The money is no matter to Depp, however, as he plans to make the move for Wounded Knee using his own personal savings.  Depp's standard salary is said to be around $20million per picture, and his total net worth is in the $200million to $300million range.  With that deep of a bank account, Wounded Knee's asking price of $3.9million should not cause a second glance.  ‘I am doing my best to make that happen. It’s land they were pushed on to and then they were massacred there. It really saddens me,’ he told the Mail On Sunday.  The area near Wounded Knee Creek on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota is the site where the last major battle of the American Indian Wars took place.  The fight began when the American troops tried to disarm the Lakota Indians, and when one elderly tribesman refused to hand over his weapon the troops began to attack.  The exact number of casualties differs in various reports, but there were thought to be at least 150 members of the Lakota tribe- including men, women and children- who were killed. The massacre has caused outrage from historians as at least 20 American soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for their role in the bloodshed.  Commemoration: Wounded Knee is now a National Historic Landmark but Depp thinks it should belong to the Native Americans who once lived on the land"
E59,0,Jimmy Carter: “Medical Marijuana Cured My Cancer”,"While speaking to ABC News about the remission of his cancer, former President Jimmy Carter credited marijuana for killing of his cancer cells.  The Nobel winner thanked his doctors and family for their support through his brain cancer ordeal.

Carter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer“I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.  “Edibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.”  The future is bright for the 91-year-old humanitarian. Carter has resumed his house building for Habitat for Humanity and continues his weekly prayer service. “Marijuana is God’s medicine. I find indica is better than sativa, but there are plenty of good hybrids.“  Carter wasn’t endorsing pot smoking for everyone. “There is the right place and the right time to spark up a bowl. Don’t be a pothead but also be aware of the potential benefits of cannabis when used in moderation with the right music.  “I was never of big fan of alcohol but weed is the medicine I need. It also revived my love for peanuts. Have you ever eaten a peanut… on weed?”  With legal weed available in Colorado and Washington State and several states likely to pass the legalization next November during the Presidential elections, Carter will help support the cause in California, Oregon, and Massachusetts.  “Help build a house for those that need one and peace and sex above all else.

Lawyers for the show submitted a minor's contract to an L.A. Superior Court judge ... it's required because Bindi is 17. Her mom Terri signed a form stating she gives up all rights to any money her daughter will make on the show.  Here's the rub. For some reason the judge wants the same release from Bindi's dad, the late Steve Irwin﻿. The judge said without proof of Steve giving up his rights to Bindi's money, ""the court is unable to find that it is in the best interest of the minor to be bound by the terms of the contract.""  It's unclear if the judge is unaware Steve died in 2006, or if she's just a stickler for a death certificate.  We're told lawyers for the show will do what it takes to get the judge to sign off. When she does, here's Bindi's deal:  -- a guarantee of $125k  -- by making it to weeks 3 and 4 she gets an additional $10k per week  -- week 5 gets her another $15,000  -- weeks 6 and 7 she gets $20k a week  -- weeks 8 and 9 she gets $30k a week  -- and if she makes it to 10 and 11 she gets $50,000 a week  Bindi has made it through week 8, so her total so far is $230k, and still going strong."

According to top Hollywood publicist and crisis manager Howard Bragman, he was approached by people close to Sheen six months ago to deal with the crisis, but never dealt with him directly. “The interview could open up a lot of sympathy for him, but he has to be concerned about a fear of litigation from former sexual partners.

Bragman says he was informed that Sheen “is getting treatment, and a lot of people in his life know about it.”  “It’s been going on for quite awhile.

It was very hard to get up the courage for him to talk about it.”  “I’ve known about this a long time, it’s not a surprise to me,” says Bragman of the news (which was first reported by the National Enquirer). “I feel very sorry for his pain.

E223,0,Hatchet Massacre: 53 Dead After Man Slaughters Guests In Their Sleep On Halloween Night,"Queen Mary Long Beach, Ca, – Queen Mary’s “Dark Harbor” is an annual Halloween tradition, where people come from across the country to stay on the haunted ship during the Halloween holiday. The event consists of mazes, monsters, séances and haunted tours. However, the real scare came in a way no one ever expected it to.  On Sunday morning, aboard the Queen Mary ship in Long Beach California, a graphic scene emerged as police did their best to get an accurate body count. At 2:33 AM, a guest aboard the ship approached the bartender at the Observation Bar dazed and confused. “Please, go down the hallway and see if you saw what I saw. It’s a massacre, a complete massacre,” said Paul Brown, a hotel guest on the ship.  The bartender phoned security, and followed the man’s instructions. What they found down the hallway were 32 open room doors with trails of blood, so much blood that it was unlike anything detectives had seen before. 58 blood covered corpses awaited the police upon their arrival at the crime scene. All 58 victims were found in their beds, with several being dismembered. As detectives went from body to body, they found that 6 of them still had pulses and were immediately rushed to the hospital. One man died while being transported by the ambulance.  The police discovered a bloody hatchet about 15 feet from the stairway entrance of the B Deck where the massacre occurred. The brand was a Tactical Tomahawk hatchet with the letters “SA” carved into the side of the handle. Authorities have taken all evidence into custody, but have no leads yet as to who may have committed these heinous murders. Police have released a statement saying they believe the murders may have been an inside job; the murderer entered each room with a master key used in housekeeping. The ship has been shut down indefinitely until detectives can complete their investigation.  Police are putting the area of Long Beach, California and the surrounding areas, on high alert; warning that there is a mass murderer on the loose. People are urged to call your local authorities if you see anything suspicious."

politifact11989,0,Memory Lapse? Trump Seeks Distance From 'Advisor' With Past Ties to Mafia," -- Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss.  Even though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country.  “If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,” Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago.  In recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.  Away from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian émigré who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.”  Asked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. ""Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,"" he told the reporter. ""I'm not that familiar with him.""  Trump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump’s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a “senior advisor"" to Trump.  Sater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his “most prized project.” For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a ""senior advisor"" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump’s attorney about it, that portion of Sater’s online resume was deleted.  The “senior advisor” title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.  Alan Garten, Trump’s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump “had no real direct relationship with Felix Sater” and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump “in my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.”  A few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater’s Trump business card with the “senior advisor” title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater’s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles “in order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.”  Garten said Sater was “never employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization” and that “no deals ever came from those activities” in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater’s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.  Trump’s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.  The cast of characters who participated in Trump’s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his “tremendous” record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.  The connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.  As Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when “somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children” with a proposal for a development deal. “It could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,” Trump said, “but somebody from Bayrock.”  Sater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “I’ll kill you. I’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.  As he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million “pump and dump” stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had “planned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,” the release said.  Prosecutors said Sater and others had “enlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.”  Sater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past ""at your own risk"" but did not cite specific concerns.  During this period, Sater’s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the “chief operating officer” or “managing director.” In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. “I was probably number two man in the company,” he said. “The actual position, I don't remember what it was.”  While the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.  During this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, “exquisite gardens,” and “a world-class celebrity chef restaurant.”  The project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against “the Trump/Bayrock Organization,” the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to “electrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.”  Sater’s lawyer calls the allegation “an outright fabrication” made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.  Reached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump’s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.  Trump’s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.  “To be clear,” Garten told ABC News, “Mr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.”  Sater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater’s ties to Trump and describing his “tangled past.” The article reported that Sater “had been an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.”  Sater told the Times that activity was in the past. “I’m trying to lead an exemplary existence,” he said then. “Old, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.”  While Sater’s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a “cooperator” on a range of matters.  Sater’s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.  “The defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,” her statement said. He provided information “crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.”  Garten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was “surprised.”  “He had no idea,” Garten said. It “was the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.”  Garten added, “When you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it’s just not appropriate.""  Once that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump “cut all ties” with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.  Asked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, “You’re going to look at the deal, you’re not going to look at the broker.”  During his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater’s past, Trump said he knew Sater had “got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.” And, he added, “I don’t know him very well, but I don’t think he was connected to the mafia.”  In 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn’t say “You’re fired!” to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.  “I hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,” he said, walking out of the room.  Trump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.  In August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul’s past dealings with Sater. ""I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,"" Lewandowski replied. ""I've never heard of the guy.”  For investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.  Cathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown – which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump’s photos and such slogans as ""There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.""  “I invested because it was Trump,” Cather told ABC News.  ABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report."
E287,0,Man dies on Aer Lingus flight after being restrained - reports,"A man has died on board an Aer Lingus flight from Lisbon to Dublin after reportedly being restrained when he became agitated and bit a man, Irish police said.    Officers were investigating after the flight was diverted to Cork when the captain declared a “medical emergency”. According to an RTE report, the man became unwell and then fell unconscious after being restrained on the Sunday night flight.    It is not known exactly when he died, but police said he was pronounced dead at the scene when the aircraft landed at Cork shortly before 6pm. He was reportedly unaccompanied on the flight.    RTE reported that a second man was taken to hospital and that the estimated 170 passengers and crew on board the plane were being questioned. The passengers were due to be taken to Dublin by bus on Sunday night.    Aer Lingus did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
E40,0,Did a North Carolina Town Reject Solar Panels?,"Residents of a North Carolina town rejected the local installation of a solar farm over fears the technology was harmful.  Concerns hinged solely or mostly on the dangers of solar panels ""sucking up all the energy from the sun.""  A North Carolina town rejected the further installation of solar panels; some residents registered fears that the panels would disrupt the local ecosystem, while many others worried property values would be affected.  On 8 December 2015 the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald published an article titled “Woodland rejects solar farm.” The article was later aggregated to news outlets with a far larger reach, such as The Independent‘s 13 December 2015 piece “US town rejects solar panels amid fears they ‘suck up all the energy from the sun.'”  The original reported that three solar farms “had previously been accepted by the town council,” adding that a proposal to rezone part of the land north of town was subsequently rejected in the meeting:  The Woodland Town Council rejected a proposal to rezone a section of land north of town to M2 (manufacturing) from RA (residential/agricultural), essentially denying approval of a solar farm … Later in the meeting, the Town Council voted for a complete moratorium on solar farms. During the public comment period preceding the rezoning vote, citizens expressed distrust and fear of the solar panels. Mary Hobbs has been living in Woodland for 50 years and said she has watched it slowly becoming a ghost town with no job opportunities for young people. She said her home is surrounded by solar farms and is no longer worth its value because of those facilities. She added that the only people profiting are the landowners who sell their land, the solar companies, and the electrical companies.  Notably, among concerns registered were those like Hobbs’; some residents simply worried that the burgeoning solar industry would further depress the local economy and tank the values of their homes (asserting that such damage had already been done.) Others expressed concerns unrelated to property value:  The next speakers were Bobby and Jane Mann. Jane Mann said she is a local native and is concerned about the plants that make the community beautiful. She is a retired Northampton science teacher and is concerned that photosynthesis, which depends upon sunlight, would not happen and would keep the plants from growing. She said she has observed areas near solar panels where the plants are brown and dead because they did not get enough sunlight. She also questioned the high number of cancer deaths in the area, saying no one could tell her that solar panels didn’t cause cancer. “I want to know what’s going to happen,” she said. “I want information. Enough is enough. I don’t see the profit for the town. Bobby Mann said he watched communities dry up when I-95 came along and warned that would happen to Woodland because of the solar farms. “You’re killing your town,” he said. “All the young people are going to move out.” He said the solar farms would suck up all the energy from the sun and businesses would not come to Woodland.  Comments made by the Manns were widely reproduced across web sites in the United States and internationally. However, Jane Mann’s concerns differed slightly from Bobby Mann’s, who likened the transformation of the town to the one that occurred when Interstate 95 routed through the area and affected the flow of commerce. While both cited ambient fears about the panels’ effect on the local ecosystem, the latter concern spoke more directly to general worries about large-scale changes to the local economy.  We contacted the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald and spoke to author Keith Hoggard about the article and its unexpected reach. He confirmed that The Independent‘s take was mostly accurate, and that the residents didn’t want another solar panel installation.  However, it’s worth mentioning that Hoggard’s original article mainly addressed residents’ concerns about the impact of multiple solar farms on property values and local commerce. Some residents expressed fears about solar panel safety, but they were not the sole voices of dissent at the council meeting."
E91,0,Model Pixee Fox has 15 surgeries and 6 RIBS removed to look like Jessica Rabit,"With her impossibly tiny waist, inflated cleavage and doll-like face, she looks as if she's just stepped out of a cartoon.  But Pixee Fox, 25, is very much a living, breathing woman and she's spent more than $119,200 (£79,160) on surgical procedures to achieve her look.  Most shockingly, the former electrician from Sweden has had six of her lower ribs removed in a bid to shrink her waist to a record-breaking 14 inches.  Scroll down for video  Pixee Fox, 25, who is originally from Sweden but now lives in North Carolina, recently had six ribs removed as part of her transformation to look like a living cartoon character  The former electrician has a list of surgeries planned for 2016 to continue her transformation  'People often come up to me and say, ""Don't take this the wrong way, but you look like a cartoon"". she says. 'But for me that's a compliment, that's what I want to achieve.'  Pixee cites her inspirations as Jessica Rabbit, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Holli Would from Cool World.  She has 70,000 followers on Instagram and insists she is a good role model for them.  'Those cartoon characters represent the idealisation of the female body,' she explains.  'I want to have the tiny waist, the butt, big boobs, big eyes and a really pretty face.  'Having my ribs removed was just another step in achieving that ideal.'  Pictured before her transofrmation, Pixee still had a stunning figure, but she said she was inspired to go under the knife because she wants to look like Jessica Rabbit, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Holli Would from Cool World  Pixie's waist is now a tiny 16 inches, but she's aiming to shrink it even further to a record breaking 14 inches  The inspiration behind her look is cartoon characters such as Jessica Rabbit, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and Holli Would from Cool World  After four breast augmentations, Pixee's chest has now gone from an A-cup to a 38-J  Pixee, who now lives in North Carolina, underwent the extreme five-hour keyhole surgery to have her ribs removed in Indianapolis last month after Dr Barry Eppley agreed to perform the procedure.  The operation, which is irreversible, is usually performed for medical reasons, but it can be done for cosmetic purposes after extensive consultation.  'Getting my ribs removed has always been a dream of mine,' Pixee says. 'But it was really hard, almost impossible, to find a surgeon to do it.  Next year Pixee will have butt and hip implants, eyelash implants, and fat removal to help make her cheeks 'pop' more  The aspiring model works out for up to five hours a day in a bid to slim down even further  Her commitment to achieving the tiniest waist in the world requires serious training  Now she's had her ribs removed, PIxee's lower organs such as the liver are no longer protected  Pixee's fans on social media are helping to fund her surgical procedures  Pixee could 'see results and feel the difference' within two days of her surgery  'The only reason I have been able to do it now is that doctors finally started taking me seriously.  'They they can see I'm not a crazy person and that I know what I'm doing.'  Pixee's recovery from the $9,000 (£6,000) operation was supposed to take six weeks.  However, she was already back into her normal routine of wearing a corset 24/7 just two days later.  'I can see the results and feel the difference,' she says. 'Before the corset would push against the ribs, which makes it harder and more painful to wear.  Before she became surgery obsessed, Pixee was a fresh-faced beauty  Pixee is currently single, but has 70,000 admirers on Instagram  By continuing her intense workouts, Pixie hopes to whittle her waist down even further. She wears a corset 24 hours a day to help reach her goal  Taking into account lost wages, medicines and travelling Pixee estimates it has cost her about $119,200 (£80,000) to look like this  'Now I can wear it even tighter without any pain. I think I am pretty close to the world record for smallest waist.  The current record holder is American Cathie Jung, 78, who has a 15-inch waist.  'If I just get time to heal and workout and continue my lifestyle I'm going to go down to 14 inches,' says Pixee.  The blonde has always been self conscious about her nose, and has had four separate rhinoplasties  Pictured before a cosmetic procedure, Pixee describes having her ribs removed as 'a dream'  She underwent the extreme five-hour keyhole surgery in Indianapolis last month after Dr Barry Eppley finally agreed to perform the procedure  Pixee says her surgeon agreed to remove her ribs because he 'can see see I'm not a crazy person and that I know what I'm doing'  The operation is normally only performed for medical reasons, but can occasionally be done for cosmetic purposes after extensive consultatoin  She's also had CoolSculpting, a non-invasive treatment to freeze fat  The procedures have taken 5ft 4in Pixee's measurements from 30-24-34 to an eye-watering 38-16-39.  In a bid to shrink her waist even further, she works out daily for up to four or five hours.  Eating substantial food such as bread or meat is a struggle, as it's uncomfortable because of her restrictive corset.  So she mainly eats vegetables, fruit and nuts, which she blends into a smoothie, as well as taking extra vitamins.  In her younger years, Pixee lived with her parents and older sister in a small rural town outside of Stockholm  'Sweden is a very egalitarian country which does not encourage you to stand out,' Pixie says. She never felt she fitted in before she began her makeover  'Cartoon characters represent the idealisation of the female body,' says Pixie  A Brazilian butt lift has given Pixee the rounded posterior she desired  A former boyfriend encouraged PIxee to have her first boob job  Pixee believes she's an inspiration to fans to be true to the person that's inside  Now that so many of her ribs have been removed, Pixee's lower internal organs, including the liver, have lost some of their natural protection.  However, she isn't worried about the risk to her health if she's in an accident.  'Before if I was in a car crash I would have broken my ribs,' she said. 'If that happened now I'm probably going to break my spleen instead.  'But I'm not concerned as I have my corset as my artificial ribcage now and I wear it 24/7.'  In her younger years, Pixee lived a much less glamorous existence living with her parents and older sister in a small rural town outside of Stockholm.  'Sweden is a very egalitarian country which does not encourage you to stand out.  Her corset makes it uncomfortable to eat full meals, so Pixee often survives on vegetables and fruit whizzed into a smoothie. She also takes extra vitamin supplements  The rib removal operation, which is irreversible, is usually performed for medical reason  Pixee says that people look up to her because of her complete devotion to what she calls 'the bimbo life'.  'I didn't feel like I fitted in. I was a tomboy. I worried about my nose, I didn't date and I felt vulnerable.'  After leaving school she trained as an electrician and saved up for a nose job.  What I want to do is get a message out there that whatever you decide to do, you should dare to be yourself and surround yourself with people that support you for who you are  Her boyfriend at the time then encouraged her to have two boob jobs that took her from an A to a C-cup.  But it was after splitting from him in 2013 that her obsession to become a real-life cartoon really picked up.  In total, she's had four rhinoplasties to sculpt the perfect nose and four breast augmentations to inflate her cleavage to a J-cup.  Her upper eyelids have been operated on and she's had two round of liposuction.  She's had injectable fillers to plump up her cheeks and lips, and a Brazilian butt lift to give her a more rounded derrière.  The aspiring model has even had a labiaplasty - a so-called 'designer vagina' operation that reduces excess tissue from the labia.  She's also had CoolSculpting, a non-invasive treatment to freeze fat.  The current record holder for the smallest waist in the world is American Cathie Jung, 78, who has a 15-inch waist. Pixee is hoping to steal her title  The model has her clothes custom made as conventional sizes don't fit her altered frame  Including the rib surgery she estimates she has spent $119,200 (£80,000) on surgery alone.  But taking into account lost wages, medicines and travelling she estimates the true costs is thousands of dollars more.  She paid for 11 of the procedures out of her own earnings and savings.  The rest, including her fourth breast augmentation, were paid for by fans who have been following her transformation on social media and praising her for being an 'inspiration'.  Botox injections are also part of Pixee's beauty routine. She's had injectable fillers to plump her lips and cheeks too  Her unnatural proportions are not unlike those of a Barbie doll  'Your Instagram is very inspiring,' a fan called dollproject_net wrote. 'Not only because your style is so unique and sexy, but also because of the way you share your passion with us. Thank you.'  Margaritacakes echoed the sentiment, saying: 'Your body is what motivates me to go to the gym and save up for the surgeries I plan to do!

It's so inspirational!'  However, kelly_het_wilhelm was less than impressed, writing: 'Gross rib removal. I just puked in my mouth.'  But another fan reminded Pixee to ignore any negative feedback.  'It's not anyone's business what you do to your body,' he wrote.  'I will never understand these people thinking they have the right to tell you how you should do things.'  On seeing pictures she posted while recovering in hospital after surgery, a fan wrote: 'You are so brave and so beautiful.  'I can't believe you are so angelic having just had major surgery. Good luck healing.'  Annemarchner added: 'I hope you feel better now.  'I've been following your transformation. I hope you are happy. You look amazing.'  However Pixee insists that she's not aiming to inspire people to get plastic surgery.  'What I want to do is get a message out there that whatever you decide to do, you should dare to be yourself and surround yourself with people that support you for who you are inside.  'There are so many people out there - for example transsexual people - who feel like one person inside and it doesn't reflect their outside.  'For me who I was on the outside was not who I was on the inside.  ABOUT RIB REMOVAL SURGERY Doctors may approve the procedure in several situations, such as the risk of a fractured rib puncturing a vital organ. Excess pressure in the thoracic cavity can be relieved by rib removal. Sometimes major surgery to the thoracic cavity requires rib removal to allow access to the organ that's being operated on. Ribs may also be removed to stop cancer spreading in the bone. The surgery is not recommended for cosmetic reasons, as complications can include collapsed lung, pneumonia, nerve damage, fracture to one of the other ribs, tearing of the diaphragm muscle and heavy scarring. Also, the surgery is irreversible and comes with the risk of infection associated with any major operation. Advertisement  'I get a lot of positive feedback from girls and many guys who want to have a change in their life, like a transformation, or just get more fit, more healthy.  'Everyone needs inspiration, and for me to be that inspiration really makes me feel really good.'  Pixee believes that people look up to her because of her complete devotion to what she calls 'the bimbo life'.  'There are many beautiful women who have transformed themselves in various ways, and I admire all of them,' she says.  'But most have only changed a few things or exaggerated one thing,'  'My particular transformation is about achieving a total look, which requires head-to-toe transformation and total lifestyle commitment.'  Her transformation is set to continue in 2016 as she's planning a whole new wave of surgery.  This will include butt and hip implants, eyelash implants, and cheek fat removal which will help make her cheeks 'pop' more.  She added: 'There are six billion people on the planet. Why should everyone look the same? It's boring.  'I'm not unhappy with the way I look now. I just enjoy tweaking it.  'I see myself as a body-modification artist. This is my job. This is what I do and I'm going to keep on sculpting.  'It's your life and as long as you're happy and don't hurt anyone, it shouldn't be a problem.'"
E99,0,Michelle Obama says ‘White Folks’ are what’s Wrong with America,"In a speech at Tuskegee University, an institute of higher learning in which white people are “not allowed on the bus,” First Domestic Partner Michelle Obama gave the school’s commencement address with instructions to the future agitators of America to – what else? Go forth and agitate.  According to JewsNews her mission is an extension of that of Hussein Obama, to foment unrest and destabilize America.  Her message was clear, “whatever is wrong in your life is whitey’s fault, and whitey owes you.”  She described the daily persecution inflicted upon her fellow victims at the hands of the plantation owner class as including police discrimination, the “nagging worries that you’re going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason.”  The report showed that vilifying the police is a job for the whole family at the Obama house. Simply because they’re not her type of Americans. They’re much too productive, too committed to the Constitution and of too strong a moral character for the Mooch and company. Give her some foul-mouthed parasitic anarchist street rats any day.  Never one to be accused of unifying the American people with a message of common purpose and shared ideals, the divisive Ms. Obama said, “I want to be very clear that those feelings are not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up. Not an excuse. They are not an excuse to lose hope. To succumb to feelings of despair and anger only means that in the end, we lose.”  She didn’t mean the American people or our nation lose.

E364,0,Teal pumpkins try to keep Halloween food-allergy safe,"Chocolate is frightening if you're allergic to milk, and a candy bar with nuts can be deadly. With eggs, soy and wheat also common allergies in kids, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , finding treats without tricks can be a challenge on Halloween night.  That's why the Food Allergy Research & Education organization wants Halloween lovers to go teal in October.  Their Teal Pumpkin Project encourages people to place a teal-painted pumpkin outside their door if they're offering non-foods treats, such as small toys, stickers and crayons. A flyer can also be printed from the website.  The idea took off online last year, the first time it was promoted nationally. Food Allergy Research & Education's first Facebook post about the Teal Pumpkin Project last year, reached 2.7 million people in less than 72 hours, the organization reported.  ""The Teal Pumpkin Project is an easy way to make a big impact in your community. Food allergies can be life-threatening, and they affect 1 in 13 children in the United States. We are thrilled to see so many people embracing the Teal Pumpkin Project as a way to ensure kids with food allergies can enjoy a safe, fun Halloween experience just like their friends,"" says Veronica LaFemina, spokeswoman for Food Allergy Research & Education.  Families who are managing other diseases for which candy presents a problem, such as diabetes and celiac disease, have also shown support.  If you don't want to purchase non-food items, it is helpful to separate allergy-free candy from candy that may trigger an allergic reaction if you're handing out goodies on October 31. Cross-contamination is a concern, as many food allergies require only a small amount of the allergen to trigger a reaction.  Tips for parents  Parents should also use extra caution when checking Halloween candy if their child has an allergy.  ""Checking labels becomes very pivotal because during the holidays, including Halloween, when the manufacturers make those mini small-sized candies and they're often mass-produced on shared equipment,"" says Mireille Schwartz, the founder and CEO of the Bay Area Allergy Advisory Board. ""Candy that's safe other times of the year might not be safe during Halloween.""  Carrying an epinephrine auto-injector, which treats all anaphylaxis, is also a good safety measure. Schwartz recommends checking to see if the medication is up-to-date before leaving the house, as auto-injectors typically expire within one year.  And while enjoying treats while walking door-to-door is a highlight of Halloween, it's best if parents make sure their child avoids the sweets until they can be inspected at home.  For younger children, Schwartz adds, ""You don't want to bring up the larger, darker side of things. You just want to say you're going to check the candy to make sure it's safe."""
E173,0,Montana TV Station Reports Bass Pro Shops Is Buying Cabela’s,"NEWS: On 11 November 2015, Billings, Montana, television station KULR published an article titled “Cabela’s Employees Concerned About Future,” reporting that a source (who spoke on the condition of anonymity) had disclosed a pending merger between two popular outdoor recreational goods chains:  We have developing news regarding a major retailer here in Billings. Sources told KULR’s Leah Jordan that a major buyout is coming regarding Cabela’s. Several employees expressed concern about what the looming buyout means for the future. Management confirmed to employees that a competitor may buy out Cabela’s, according to an anonymous staff member. The sources said the deal was finalized Nov. 9, and the formal take-over will be Jan. 1, 2016.  The source of the claim was purportedly a Cabela’s “staff member,” and from the description that person sounded like a retail level worker. The context in which that employee shared his purported knowledge with KULR wasn’t described in the article (which included a quote from the individual who leaked the claim):  “The manager had told her that her job was going to basically be overcome Jan 1. Several other people were commenting on it, and as I was leaving work another employee was talking to a department manager. So I stopped and caught the tail end of their conversation, so I approached him and said, ‘So this is true? We are being bought out and we are not going to have jobs?’ He said, ‘I don’t know whether they will keep anyone, I don’t know if the store will stay open or what their plans are.’ I said, ‘Well, is the January 1st deadline true?’ And he said, ‘Yes.'” the anonymous employee said.  KULR reported that “management was specifically instructed not to disclose the deal involving the potential buyout.” The claim proved popular on social media sites, particularly among hunting and fishing enthusiasts:  Bass Pro Shops potentially buying out Cabela’s can only mean one thing: $2 For quality trucker hats in Charleston #Redemption — Josh (@Josh_Hudson9) November 12, 2015  $CAB is in play with Bass Pro doing some holiday shopping.

It’s important to note that no other media outlets in the country have reported on the alleged deal.  On 12 November 2015, business news channel CNBC reported that Bass Pro Shops was “exploring an offer” to acquire the Cabela’s brand but didn’t mention any extant agreements between the two companies:  Privately held outdoors retailer Bass Pro Shops is exploring an offer for Cabela’s, the U.S. hunting and fishing store chain targeted by activist investor Elliott Management, people familiar with the matter said. Bass Pro is working with an investment bank on the potential offer, the people said this week. Cabela’s has recently begun to explore its options and has also reached out to private equity firms to solicit interest, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bass Pro Shops declined comment, while Cabela’s did not respond to a request for comment.  Neither Bass Pro Shops nor Cabela’s has acknowledged the rumors. An editor’s note appended to the KULR report noted:"
E217,0,Australia: School allows Muslim students to leave the room to avoid singing the National Anthem,"Cranbourne Carlisle Primary School’s slogan is “Many Cultures, One Community.” But in reality, they’re not one community at all — not when they allow Muslim students to opt out of singing the National Anthem. “But Cranbourne Carlisle Primary School Principal Cheryl Irving stood by the decision, telling Star News on Tuesday it was made in adherence with Muharram – the Islamic month of mourning associated with Shi’a Muslims in which they do not participate in ‘joyful events.'” Are all the Muslim students at Cranbourne Carlisle Primary School Shi’ites, then? Shi’ites are only ten to fifteen percent of Muslims worldwide, so that’s extremely unlikely. Much more likely is that Cheryl Irving received complaints from Muslim parents, who told her that singing the Australian National Anthem was offensive to their religion, and being a good multiculturalist, readily agreed to allow them to opt out.  But what will become of these students in the future? They have been taught that they need have no allegiance to Australia, and that Australian authorities allow and respect this. How will they acquire that allegiance in the future? Does Cheryl Irving really think that there will be no negative consequences of their failing to do so?  “Kids opt out on anthem,” by Lachlan Moorhead, Cranbourne News, October 21, 2015 (thanks to Kenneth):"

That's syndicated columnist Mark Shields and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.  David Brooks is off tonight.  Gentlemen, it's good to have you with us.  MARK SHIELDS: Good to be with you.  JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, the fiscal cliff, it's still with us. It's still out there. The president made a last-minute statement late this afternoon. Where does everything stand?  MARK SHIELDS: Nobody knows, Judy.  RELATED INFORMATION The very best from our political pundits, NewsHour regulars Mark Shields and David Brooks.  What happened last night in the Republican Caucus is precedent-shattering. I mean, it really is, that John Boehner could not get a majority of his own caucus to support what had become the Republican position, endorsed not simply by him, but by Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy and Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor.  And it's a real problem. I think it puts at risk Boehner's own leadership and his ability to deliver Republicans. It weakens the bargaining position for Republicans in the final negotiations. But I don't know how much closer we are, because I think it strengthens the liberals in the Democratic Caucus, which is going to make it tougher for the Republicans to accept it, because a weakened Republican means a strengthened, emboldened Democratic liberal group.  And I just think that there's too many moving parts at this point to say, this is what is going to happen.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you -- what do you -- can it get done, Michael? I mean, it's. . .  MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I generally agree with Mark.  And today was supposed to be the end of the world. I think it feels like it for Boehner. This is a case where he ended up with 40 to 50 members of his caucus that wouldn't support anything on this.  MICHAEL GERSON: And they were to the right of Grover Norquist. Norquist was open to the Plan B.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Because he had endorsed Plan B.  MICHAEL GERSON: Right, exactly. So, they want to go off the cliff flags flying. It marginalized Boehner and the Republicans in future negotiations, and raised a question of whether anyone can get a governing majority in the House of Representatives when it comes to the budget.  Those are really serious matters. Now, it does go to the Senate, where Harry Reid and McConnell can try to come to some, you know, functional surrender for Republicans on rates, and kick the can on a lot of other issues, and see if that can pass in the next 10 days.  But that still would pass -- have to pass the House. And so I think the chances of backing off, off the cliff are higher than they ever have been.  JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, I listened to some of these recalcitrant House Republicans today, Mark. And they were saying, I was not going to vote for a tax increase, when my constituents would never have gone along with that.  MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think there's two realities, here, Judy.  First of all, there's a lot of Republicans, and more than a few Democrats, who are terrified of one thing. That's being primaried, a primary opponent who is going to run on your right if you are a Republican, on your left if you are a Democrat. But it's really become a problem for Republicans, because this has been an article of faith that -- said before it is since 1990 that any Republican in the House or the Senate has voted for a tax increase on Capitol Hill, any Republican.  Now, of the 241 Republicans now in the House, 212 of them have come to the Congress since 1990. So, they have never voted for a tax increase. They don't know anybody who has voted for a tax increase. And they were being asked to vote for a tax increase for a tactical advantage on a piece of legislation that they knew the president, A., would veto, B., wouldn't pass the Senate.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Only on people earning over a million.  MARK SHIELDS: A million dollars, but they were going to give up their virginity, their political virginity, and risk a primary challenge -- that is how they saw it -- by doing this.  What they failed to address is the reality that, when you are the -- part of the governing party in any institution, the House, the Senate, anyplace else, you have a responsibility to make sure that you can govern. And what they did was, they robbed the Republicans, that 40 to 50. They robbed the Republicans of that -- that sense of leadership, of governability, and robbed them, I think, and reduced the brand of the Republican Party even more.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it a fundamental disagreement over what governing is?  MICHAEL GERSON: Yes, I think that that is part of it.  I think what they couldn't answer is how they are going to get a better result. . .  MARK SHIELDS: That's right.  MICHAEL GERSON: . . . after you -- when you go over the cliff, or later on in these negotiations, because they're not. This actually undermines their negotiating power and position, which -- because it is a foolish position to be in.  But it does -- it raises some really big issues. I mean, one of them here is that we now have a president and a speaker who both wanted a deal, OK? By every account, they wanted a deal. They tried it twice. And they couldn't make it happen.  Now, they -- and I don't think they can make it happen. It's a serious kind of governing challenge right now. If you look, we have got a short-term political crisis. We have a long-term fiscal crisis. And we're providing no confidence whatsoever that we can approach those things as a government in a mature way.  We look increasingly like we have the dysfunction, the governmental dysfunction of Europe, without the excuse of being separate countries. And, you know, I think it's a serious challenge to America's standing in the world, that -- the views of credit markets. And Washington is not taking that yet with sufficiency seriously -- seriousness.  MARK SHIELDS: Yes.  I would just add, and not in a partisan way, but the 213 -- 215-209 vote last night in the House before the whole thing came apart, which was that -- to not take the sequestration funds out of defense, but to take them out of domestic spending, was a party-line vote; 209 Democrats stuck on that. Not a single one broke.  And I think -- I think you are seeing far more unity in the Democratic ranks than you are in the Republican ranks right now. I agree it is a governmental problem. If the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and we see it reflected in the financial markets and the stock market and elsewhere, then it's a governmental problem. It's not simply a Democratic advantage, a Republican advantage.  But, right now, the real fault lines are in the Republican Caucus.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we don't -- sounds like neither one -- none of us knows where this is headed.  So let's move to another subject.  Michael, the president today named John Kerry to be secretary of state. It had been widely believed he wanted to choose the U.N. ambassador, Susan Rice.  John Kerry -- what do you make of the choice?  MICHAEL GERSON: Well, it's a -- I think, a safe choice and a good choice. I mean, this is a man who has had three decades on the Foreign Relations Committee, former presidential candidate, would have immediate standing on the global stage, similar to Hillary Clinton, in this kind of job.  He's also been a troubleshooter for the president in some key ways, under the radar screen. When South Sudan was separating from the North, and it looked like those negotiations were breaking down, Kerry came in and really made a difference there. So, I think that, I mean, he looks good after the Rice nomination. He is a less controversial nominee.  He has a lot of respect among his colleagues in the Senate. And so I think that the president -- you know, it was not -- not particularly a hard choice.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?  MARK SHIELDS: I think James Mann and David Ignatius put it very well, I mean, that he is -- he is experienced, probably unmatched in experience. He does bring considerable stature, on a first-name basis with many of the people around the world with whom he will be dealing. He has done, as David pointed out, back-channel missions for the president, whether it's dealing with Hamas, Afghanistan, Pakistan.  And he is eminently confirmable. That's in the Senate. There is no question about it. And it opens up a possibility of a Republican seat in Massachusetts. So, Republicans are cheered by that.  (LAUGHTER)  JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just quickly, before we leave that, there was a -- and this -- we heard this mentioned earlier, that some -- there is still conversation about whether the president is going to name, may name Chuck Hagel, former Republican senator, to be secretary of defense.  A lot of criticism has risen up. Outside groups are saying they are going to defeat him if he's named. What is going on there?  MARK SHIELDS: Yes.  Well, I mean, certainly, Chuck Hagel has been subjected to withering criticism for his lack of constant or at least unswerving support of every Israeli administration. That has been a central part. There are people who have personal issues with Chuck Hagel.  I personally think, A., he's close to the president. He was close to the president when the president was in the Senate. And I think he brings to it credentials that are sadly lacking in this administration. I mean, this is somebody who has spilled blood, shed blood for his own country, spilled blood for his country, faced combat, chose to go to Vietnam.  He had orders to go to Germany as an enlisted man. He insisted on going to Vietnam, where he faced serious combat. I just think -- I think he brings to it the first Vietnam veteran to be secretary of defense and the only enlisted man ever to be Secretary of Defense. I think those are credentials that are needed.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Any thoughts on that?  MICHAEL GERSON: I think that, sometimes, people say these trial balloons are a sign of presidential weakness if they don't go up.  They're not really. They're actually a smart way for a president to gauge this. I think the opposition to Hagel is growing. I think it is rooted in disagreements, not just about Israel, but about defense cuts, but about his views on Iran, which are significantly to the left of president, and because he has -- he doesn't have a lot of respect of former colleagues here, which are already coming out, and many of them in opposition.  I think it's an unlikely nomination.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you both to the gun control discussion.  We heard from the head of the NRA, Mark, today, Wayne LaPierre, who is advocating putting an armed guard in every school. The president has launched a task force this week. Where do you see this headed?  MARK SHIELDS: I mean, to call Wayne LaPierre and the NRA have a tin ear, I think is an understatement. I mean, they seem to be almost whining about criticism of their position, that it somehow was rooted in the press bias or elected officials who have gun-free school zones.  You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the -- all the wars, all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years.  We have half the guns that are in the world are in the United States. I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Something like 280 million guns.  MICHAEL GERSON: Yes. And we're not going to get rid of all those guns. That's not going to happen. The question is. . .  MARK SHIELDS: Well, we could do -- we could do Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and tax ammunition.  MICHAEL GERSON: Well, yes.  I think that there -- but there are a series of reasonable measures we could take, even going back to what we were doing in the 1990s, when it comes to ammunition, and magazine size, and assault -- certain types of semiautomatic weapons.  You should be able to make that case. We have swung so far in this debate in the libertarian direction, that those are fairly minimal burdens on anyone's rights when it comes to this that might have a marginal positive in fact -- impact on gun violence.  But any solution is also going have to deal with mental health issues. Security in schools, I don't think it's practical to put armed people in tens of thousands of schools. But security in schools, as well as reasonable gun controls, we're going to have to do a bunch of things in this area.  JUDY WOODRUFF: Sobering topic, and we will be coming back to it.  Michael Gerson, Mark Shields, thank you both.  MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy. Thank you.  JUDY WOODRUFF: And Merry Christmas.  MICHAEL GERSON: Merry Christmas.  MARK SHIELDS: Merry Christmas to you. Thank you."
E382,0,Drug CEO Will Lower Price of Daraprim After Hike Sparked Outrage,"The pharmaceutical company boss under fire for increasing the price of the drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent said Tuesday he will lower the cost of the life-saving medication.  Martin Shkreli did not say what the new price would be, but expected a determination to be made over the next few weeks.  He told NBC News that the decision to lower the price was a reaction to outrage over the increase in the price of the drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill.  Martin Shkreli. Paul Taggart / Bloomberg via Getty Images file  ""Yes it is absolutely a reaction — there were mistakes made with respect to helping people understand why we took this action, I think that it makes sense to lower the price in response to the anger that was felt by people,” Shkreli, 32, said.  Turing Pharmaceuticals of New York bought the drug from Impax Laboratories in August for $55 million and raised the price. Shkreli said Tuesday the price would be lowered to allow the company to break even or make a smaller profit.  RELATED: Drug That Fights Potentially Deadly Infection Goes From $13.50 to $750  Daraprim fights toxoplasmosis. The infection is particularly dangerous for people who have weakened immune systems, like AIDS patients, as well as for pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The New York Times first reported the price increase on Sunday.  Shkreli, the founder and CEO of Turing, had said the money from the increase would be used to develop better treatment for toxoplasmosis that have fewer side effects. He told NBC News Tuesday that drugs like Daraprim will not exist if small companies cannot get a return on their investment.  ""It's very easy to see a large drug price increase and say 'Gosh, those people must be gouging.' But when you find out that the company is not really making any money, what does that mean?” Shkreli said in a phone interview with NBC News Tuesday. ""It’s very hard stuff to understand.""  The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association objected to the price increase, saying ""this cost is unjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population in need of this medication.""  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was among those who expressed outrage over the price increase. On Tuesday she outlined a plan she said would limit how much patients have to pay out of pocket for medications each month.  RELATED: Hillary Clinton Blasts Daraprim Price Increase, Vows Plan  ""I think in the society we live in today it's easy to want to villainize people, and obviously we're in an election cycle where this is very, very tough topic for people and it's very sensitive. And I understand the outrage,"" Shkreli said.  Shkreli said on Twitter Tuesday afternoon that he planned to ""set the record straight on misconceptions and announce some adjustments to our plan."" He planned to make his Twitter account private after that.  Shkreli acknowledged that the cost to produce the drug is low — but he said that doesn't take into account ""the quality control, the regulatory costs, and all of the other things that come with having a drug company.""  ""We'll know in several weeks how profitable the drug is, if it at all,"" Shkreli said in the NBC News interview. ""It may turn out that's it not even profitable at all, even at this price."""

Julie Mott died earlier this month from cystic fibrosis and the 25-year-old's body was stolen after her funeral service last Saturday at the Mission Park North Funeral Chapel in San Antonio.  The funeral was held on what would have been the young woman's 26th birthday.  Julie Mott's body was stolen after her funeral service at the Mission Park North Funeral Chapel in San Antonio  The 25-year-old died earlier this month from cystic fibrosis and was going to be cremated after the service  Staff members at the funeral home discovered that her body was missing the following day  Staff members at the funeral home discovered that her body was missing the next day and police believe that it was taken within a three-hour window between the conclusion of the service and the end of the business day at the establishment, the New York Daily News reported.  The body was the clear target SAPD Sergeant Javier Salazar  There were no signs of forced entry and no alarms were set off at the home.  The site doesn't have surveillance cameras so it is unclear how her remains were taken.  San Antonio Police Department Sgt Javier Salazar said: 'Whoever did it was pretty daring about it.  'Our No 1 priority, of course, is getting her back to her family.  'A close second is to find out who the person was who did it and bring them to justice.'  Police believe she was taken within a three-hour window before the end of business at the home (above)  The San Antonio College graduate spent much of her life bedridden because of her illness  Salazar added that police are not ruling anything out and said he had never seen a case like this in his 22 years in law enforcement, according to the New York Post.  'This was not a case of somebody thinking they were stealing an empty casket,' Salazar said.  'The body was the clear target.'  Tim Mott, Julie's father, told KSAT on Friday: 'We just want our daughter's remains returned, so we can have some closure to our grief.'  The owner of Mission Park North, Dick Tips, suggested the theft might have been carried out by someone who didn't believe in cremation.  He said: 'I can't believe this is happening to such dear friends of mine and she's a dear friend of mine.  'This is a person that I know. This is a person that I know and I want her back.'

Mott's condition was diagnosed when she was two  'Julie lived her life in a house full of love,' according to her obituary.  'Her family was deeply devoted to her living as normal of a life as possible.  'Perhaps her greatest relationship was the one she had with her mother.  'The bond between a mother and her daughter is always strong, but theirs was stronger.  'Through the doctor appointments and the hospital stays, the love they shared for one another grew with each passing day.  'Julie will continue to live in the hearts and minds of those who had the pleasure to know and love her.'  Due to her lifelong illness, which she was diagnosed with when she was just two, Mott was only expected to live to the age of three.

E235,0,FBI Warning Nation's Police of Anarchist Halloween,"The FBI has issued an alert to police departments across the country warning that anarchist groups are planning a “Halloween revolt” plot aimed at attacking local police during Halloween week.  The New York Post learned the FBI said that a group called the “National Liberation Militia” is planning to don costumes and then to causes disturbances that will draw police to the scene. Then, the FBI warns, the groups intend to ambush the responding officers.  The FBI has refused to comment further on the threat, only saying that the alert sent to police agencies across the country was part of a “continuous dialogue” with police departments.  Los Angeles police have determined that the warning is not based on a “credible threat” in their city. New York police also reported that there is no known threat to the Big Apple.  NBC noted that the FBI said that this “National Liberation Militia” is a group on their watch list, but also pointed out that little can be found about the group online. A look online shows a black power group called the New Black Liberation Militia, but no mention of the group revealed by the FBI this week. There is also no mention of the National Liberation Militia on the FBI’s website.  Still, it is not uncommon for first responders to be ambushed upon arriving at the scene of a fire or a crime.  Last November, for instance, in Leon County, Florida, police and firemen were fired upon when they responded to a house fire. One sheriff’s deputy was shot and killed, and a second deputy was also shot in the incident. The shooter was eventually killed by Tallahassee police who also responded to the scene.  Black Lives Matter protesters have also interfered with first responders. Earlier this year a rioter in Baltimore was arrested after cutting a fire hose when firemen arrived to put out the flames of a CVS pharmacy set ablaze by protesters. Also, during protests in New York in December of last year, several protesters tried to stop police from arresting a CUNY professor for throwing a trash can and inciting a riot.

E188,0,The five surprising health benefits of champagne,"We ought to feel sorry for champagne. So often dismissed as a luxury or party accessory, it rarely gets the chance to be heralded in its own right as a serious drink for every day consumption.  The truth, however, is that champagne is in fact a medicine, just like Calpol or marijuana. And we can prove it.  Here are five reasons to pop open a bottle of bubbly for its own sake (and then another one, perhaps, to celebrate your new health kick.)  *Always drink alcohol responsibly. Likewise Calpol. Never drink - or absorb in any form – marijuana, unless you are in a country where it is legal to do so.  1) It'll improve your memory  Two years ago, scientists at Reading University gave some rats champagne every day for six weeks, then asked them to complete a maze. That might sound like fraternity hazing ritual, but the results warranted celebration: without drinking champagne the rats had an average success rate in the maze of 50%, but that increased to 70% after some bubbly. ""[The] research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory,"" said the research's leader, Dr Jeremy Spencer.  Spencer's conclusion was that compounds found in the two red grapes used to make champagne – Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier – can improve memory and spatial awareness to the extent that ""three glasses a week"" could ""help delay the onset of degenerative brain disorders, such as dementia."" The experiment has yet to be repeated on humans, but at the time of the initial study Spencer hoped to conduct a trial asking 50 pensioners to drink champagne for three years in order to test its effects. Presumably he wasn't lacking for volunteers.  Puff Daddy and Jay Z won't be forgetting their lyrics any time soon Credit: Getty  2) It's good for your heart  A lot has been made of the red wine's benefits for your heart, but champagne (which is predominantly made from red grapes, of course) is just as healthy. One study found that the sparkling wine contained high levels of polyphenols – antioxidants found in red grapes but less intensely in white – that can lower blood pressure and prevent heart problems. In fact, Reading's Dr Jeremy Spencer, a man who appears to have generously given his life over to finding reasons for us to drink more, suggested that two glasses a day will do the trick. ""We have found that a couple of glasses a day has a beneficial effect on the walls of blood vessels – which suggests champagne has the potential to reduce strokes and heart disease,"" he told the Observer. ""It is very exciting news."" Thanks Jeremy.  3) It gets you drunk quickly  As anyone who has enjoyed an overdrawn wedding pre-reception knows, it doesn't take long for champagne to go to one's head. That's not always a good thing, but it does make it the perfect cocktail party tipple, quickly difusing awkwardness and lifting the mood. It's all in the bubbles, apparently. An experiment by the University of Oxford, conducted on a full six peope, found that alcohol levels of participants drinking champagne were higher after 20 minutes than of those given flat sparkling wine. It was decided that fizz gets into the blood stream quicker as a result of the carbonation 'rushing' the alcohol from the stomach to the small intestine. It's a matter for debate, but whatever the effect, it doesn't last: even if you accept that bubbly gets you tipsy quicker, after around 45 minutes you'll be no more drunk than somebody having a glass of wine.  As for the inevitable crash? Heed the advice of champagne connoisseur Bill Murray, who revealed a fail-safe method in an interview with Dazed Digital last year: ""I learned how to drink champagne a while ago. I like to drink it in a big pint glass with ice. I fill it with ice and I pour the champagne in it, because champagne can never be too cold. And the problem people have with champagne is they drink it and they crash with it, because the sugar content is so high and you get really dehydrated. But if you can get the ice in it, you can drink it supremely cold and at the same time you're getting the melting ice, so it's like a hydration level, and you can stay at this great level for a whole weekend. You don't want to crash. You want to keep that buzz, that bling, that smile.""  4) It'll improve your skin  Ever wondered why successful Formula One drivers have such supple skin? Probably not, but we'll give you the definite, science-proven reason anyway: 'champers. Taking a hit of champagne to the face, as the top three drivers do on the podium after each race, might be an expensive detoxifier, but it's also an effective one. “Champagne detoxifies the skin with antioxidants and lightening tartaric acid helps even out the skin tone,” says dermatologist Marina Peredo. “For those with oily skin, its antibacterial properties aid in leaving last year’s breakouts behind.”  Feeling drowsy after a glass or three? Bill Murray has a solution Credit: Touchstone Pictures  5) It contains fewer calories than wine  Unless you consume it by the gallon, choosing champagne over wine or beer represents the diet option. Sort of. A small flute of Brut (which means it contains no more than 12 grams of residual sugar per litre) champagne is roughly 80-100 calories, fewer than a 175ml glass of wine and far healthier than a pint of beer.

politifact12755,0,Pastors To Protest IRS Rules on Political Advocacy,"On Sept. 28, pastors from 20 states will give politically based sermons from the pulpit as part of a protest organized by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal-advocacy group. The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations – including churches and other religious groups – that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastors’ political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties.  To discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle.  Featuring:  Robert W. Tuttle, David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law School  Interviewer:  Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life  Question & Answer  Before 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction?  Many members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents’ political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don’t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.  Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.  Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?  The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization.  The ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregation’s life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations.  If ADF’s protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make?  The ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a “substantial burden” on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a “compelling government interest.” The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion.  How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?  The government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregations’ rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADF’s Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermon’s theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician.  How do you think a court might evaluate these arguments?  It’s always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a court’s decision often turns on a case’s particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations.  The most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendment’s constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregation’s 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities.  The D.C. Circuit Court’s reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech.  Similarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a “substantial burden” on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity.  If ADF challenged the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions.  If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion?  This is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so “substantial” as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations.  On the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions – thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation – while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations.  Such a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications.  So the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesn’t mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, it’s very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue."
politifact11627,0,Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States,"Prepared Remarks Senator Bernie Sanders on Democratic Socialism in the United States November 19, 2015 Twitter  Facebook  Email Link  In his inaugural remarks in January 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt looked out at the nation and this is what he saw.  He saw tens of millions of its citizens denied the basic necessities of life.  He saw millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hung over them day by day.  He saw millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.  He saw millions lacking the means to buy the products they needed and by their poverty and lack of disposable income denying employment to many other millions.  He saw one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.  And he acted. Against the ferocious opposition of the ruling class of his day, people he called economic royalists, Roosevelt implemented a series of programs that put millions of people back to work, took them out of poverty and restored their faith in government. He redefined the relationship of the federal government to the people of our country. He combatted cynicism, fear and despair. He reinvigorated democracy. He transformed the country.  And that is what we have to do today.  And, by the way, almost everything he proposed was called “socialist.” Social Security, which transformed life for the elderly in this country was “socialist.” The concept of the “minimum wage” was seen as a radical intrusion into the marketplace and was described as “socialist.” Unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as “socialist.” Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class.  Thirty years later, in the 1960s, President Johnson passed Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to millions of senior citizens and families with children, persons with disabilities and some of the most vulnerable people in this county. Once again these vitally important programs were derided by the right wing as socialist programs that were a threat to our American way of life.  That was then. Now is now.  Today, in 2015, despite the Wall Street crash of 2008, which drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Depression, the American people are clearly better off economically than we were in 1937.  But, here is a very hard truth that we must acknowledge and address. Despite a huge increase in technology and productivity, despite major growth in the U.S. and global economy, tens of millions of American families continue to lack the basic necessities of life, while millions more struggle every day to provide a minimal standard of living for their families. The reality is that for the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.  The rich get much richer. Almost everyone else gets poorer. Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections. Ordinary people don’t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country and the same old, same old establishment politics and economics will not effectively address it.  If we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.  We need to create a culture which, as Pope Francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts, while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets.  Today, in America, we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few Americans know that because so much of the new income and wealth goes to the people on top. In fact, over the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth – trillions of wealth – going from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent – a handful of people who have seen a doubling of the percentage of the wealth they own over that period.  Unbelievably, and grotesquely, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.  Today, in America, millions of our people are working two or three jobs just to survive. In fact, Americans work longer hours than do the people of any industrialized country. Despite the incredibly hard work and long hours of the American middle class, 58 percent of all new income generated today is going to the top one percent.  Today, in America, as the middle class continues to disappear, median family income, is $4,100 less than it was in 1999. The median male worker made over $700 less than he did 42 years ago, after adjusting for inflation. Last year, the median female worker earned more than $1,000 less than she did in 2007.  Today, in America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings – zero – while millions of elderly and people with disabilities are trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a year. From Vermont to California, older workers are scared to death. “How will I retire with dignity?,” they ask?  Today, in America, nearly 47 million Americans are living in poverty and over 20 percent of our children, including 36 percent of African American children, are living in poverty — the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth.  Today, in America, 29 million Americans have no health insurance and even more are underinsured with outrageously high co-payments and deductibles. Further, with the United States paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write.  Today, in America, youth unemployment and underemployment is over 35 percent. Meanwhile, we have more people in jail than any other country and countless lives are being destroyed as we spend $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.  The bottom line is that today in America we not only have massive wealth and income inequality, but a power structure which protects that inequality. A handful of super-wealthy campaign contributors have enormous influence over the political process, while their lobbyists determine much of what goes on in Congress.  In 1944, in his State of the Union speech, President Roosevelt outlined what he called a second Bill of Rights. This is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president but, unfortunately, it has not gotten the attention that it deserves.  In that remarkable speech this is what Roosevelt stated, and I quote: “We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men.” End of quote. In other words, real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt’s vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved. It is time that we did.  In that speech, Roosevelt described the economic rights that he believed every American was entitled to: The right to a decent job at decent pay, the right to adequate food, clothing, and time off from work, the right for every business, large and small, to function in an atmosphere free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. The right of all Americans to have a decent home and decent health care.  What Roosevelt was stating in 1944, what Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in similar terms 20 years later and what I believe today, is that true freedom does not occur without economic security.  People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are unemployed or underpaid or when they are exhausted by working long hours. People are not truly free when they have no health care.  So let me define for you, simply and straightforwardly, what democratic socialism means to me. It builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that; “This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.” It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.  Democratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.  Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system in America today which is not only grossly unfair but, in many respects, corrupt.  It is a system, for example, which during the 1990s allowed Wall Street to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated. Then, ten years later, after the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of Wall Street led to their collapse, it is a system which provided trillions in government aid to bail them out. Wall Street used their wealth and power to get Congress to do their bidding for deregulation and then, when their greed caused their collapse, they used their wealth and power to get Congress to bail them out. Quite a system!  And, then, to add insult to injury, we were told that not only were the banks too big to fail, the bankers were too big to jail. Kids who get caught possessing marijuana get police records. Wall Street CEOs who help destroy the economy get raises in their salaries. This is what Martin Luther King, Jr. meant by socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.  In my view, it’s time we had democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations. It means that we should not be providing welfare for corporations, huge tax breaks for the very rich, or trade policies which boost corporate profits as workers lose their jobs. It means that we create a government that works for works for all of us, not just powerful special interests. It means that economic rights must be an essential part of what America stands for.  It means that health care should be a right of all people, not a privilege. This is not a radical idea. It exists in every other major country on earth. Not just Denmark, Sweden or Finland. It exists in Canada, France, Germany and Taiwan. That is why I believe in a Medicare-for-all single payer health care system. Yes. The Affordable Care Act, which I helped write and voted for, is a step forward for this country. But we must build on it and go further.  Medicare for all would not only guarantee health care for all people, not only save middle class families and our entire nation significant sums of money, it would radically improve the lives of all Americans and bring about significant improvements in our economy.  People who get sick will not have to worry about paying a deductible or making a co-payment. They could go to the doctor when they should, and not end up in the emergency room. Business owners will not have to spend enormous amounts of time worrying about how they are going to provide health care for their employees. Workers will not have to be trapped in jobs they do not like simply because their employers are offering them decent health insurance plans. Instead, they will be able to pursue the jobs and work they love, which could be an enormous boon for the economy. And by the way, moving to a Medicare for all program will end the disgrace of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  Democratic socialism means that, in the year 2015, a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago – and that public education must allow every person in this country, who has the ability, the qualifications and the desire, the right to go to a public colleges or university tuition free. This is also not a radical idea. It exists today in many countries around the world. In fact, it used to exist in the United States.  Democratic socialism means that our government does everything it can to create a full employment economy. It makes far more sense to put millions of people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, than to have a real unemployment rate of almost 10%. It is far smarter to invest in jobs and educational opportunities for unemployed young people, than to lock them up and spend $80 billion a year through mass incarceration.  Democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty: that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage – $15 an hour over the next few years. It means that we join the rest of the world and pass the very strong Paid Family and Medical Leave legislation now in Congress. How can it possibly be that the United States, today, is virtually the only nation on earth, large or small, which does not guarantee that a working class woman can stay home for a reasonable period of time with her new-born baby? How absurd is that?  Democratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed and profiteering of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet, and that we have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.  Democratic socialism means, that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and the largest corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. Yes. Innovation, entrepreneurship and business success should be rewarded. But greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support. It is not acceptable that in a rigged economy in the last two years the wealthiest 15 Americans saw their wealth increase by $170 billion, more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. Let us not forget what Pope Francis has so elegantly stated; “We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.”  It is not acceptable that major corporations stash their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying $100 billion in taxes each and every year. It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. It is not acceptable that billionaire families are able to leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable estate tax. It is not acceptable that Wall Street speculators are able to gamble trillions of dollars in the derivatives market without paying a nickel in taxes on those transactions.  Democratic socialism, to me, does not just mean that we must create a nation of economic and social justice. It also means that we must create a vibrant democracy based on the principle of one person one vote. It is extremely sad that the United States, one of the oldest democracies on earth, has one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country, and that millions of young and working class people have given up on our political system entirely. Every American should be embarrassed that in our last national election 63% of the American people, and 80% of young people, did not vote. Clearly, despite the efforts of many Republican governors to suppress the vote, we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process, not harder. It is not too much to demand that everyone 18 years of age is registered to vote – end of discussion.  Further, it is unacceptable that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires, billionaires and large corporations to contribute as much as they want to Super Pacs to elect candidates who will represent their special interests. We must overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.  So the next time you hear me attacked as a socialist, remember this:  I don’t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.  I believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America instead of shipping jobs and profits overseas.  I believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes – if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.  I don’t believe in special treatment for the top 1%, but I do believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that Black Lives Matter.  I despise appeals to nativism and prejudice, and I do believe in immigration reform that gives Hispanics and others a pathway to citizenship and a better life.  I don’t believe in some foreign “ism”, but I believe deeply in American idealism.  I’m not running for president because it’s my turn, but because it’s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity not for some, not for the few, but for all.  No one understood better than FDR the connection between American strength at home and our ability to defend America at home and across the world. That is why he proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944, and said in that State of the Union:  “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”  I’m not running to pursue reckless adventures abroad, but to rebuild America’s strength at home. I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will never send our sons and daughters to war under false pretense or pretenses or into dubious battles with no end in sight.  And when we discuss foreign policy, let me join the people of Paris in mourning their loss, and pray that those who have been wounded will enjoy a full recovery. Our hearts also go out to the families of the hundreds of Russians apparently killed by an ISIS bomb on their flight, and those who lost their lives to terrorist attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere.  To my mind, it is clear that the United States must pursue policies to destroy the brutal and barbaric ISIS regime, and to create conditions that prevent fanatical extremist ideologies from flourishing. But we cannot – and should not – do it alone.  Our response must begin with an understanding of past mistakes and missteps in our previous approaches to foreign policy. It begins with the acknowledgment that unilateral military action should be a last resort, not a first resort, and that ill-conceived military decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq, can wreak far-reaching devastation and destabilize entire regions for decades. It begins with the reflection that the failed policy decisions of the past – rushing to war, regime change in Iraq, or toppling Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, or Guatemalan President Árbenz in 1954, Brazilian President Goulart in 1964, Chilean President Allende in 1973. These are the sorts of policies do not work, do not make us safer, and must not be repeated.  After World War II, in response to the fear of Soviet aggression, European nations and the United States established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – an organization based on shared interests and goals and the notion of a collective defense against a common enemy. It is my belief that we must expand on these ideals and solidify our commitments to work together to combat the global threat of terror.  We must create an organization like NATO to confront the security threats of the 21st century – an organization that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration to defeat the rise of violent extremism and importantly to address the root causes underlying these brutal acts. We must work with our NATO partners, and expand our coalition to include Russia and members of the Arab League.  But let’s be very clear. While the U.S. and other western nations have the strength of our militaries and political systems, the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations – with the strong support of their global partners.  These same sentiments have been echoed by those in the region. Jordan’s King Abdallah II said in a speech on Sunday that terrorism is the “greatest threat to our region” and that Muslims must lead the fight against it. He noted that confronting extremism is both a regional and international responsibility, and that it is incumbent on Muslim nations and communities to confront those who seek to hijack their societies and generations with intolerance and violent ideology.  And let me congratulate King Abdallah not only for his wise remarks, but also for the role that his small country is playing in attempting to address the horrific refugee crisis in the region.  A new and strong coalition of Western powers, Muslim nations, and countries like Russia must come together in a strongly coordinated way to combat ISIS, to seal the borders that fighters are currently flowing across, to share counter-terrorism intelligence, to turn off the spigot of terrorist financing, and to end support for exporting radical ideologies.  What does all of this mean? Well, it means that, in many cases, we must ask more from those in the region. While Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon have accepted their responsibilities for taking in Syrian refugees, other countries in the region have done nothing or very little.  Equally important, and this is a point that must be made – countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE – countries of enormous wealth and resources – have contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS. That must change. King Abdallah is absolutely right when he says that that the Muslim nations must lead the fight against ISIS, and that includes some of the most wealthy and powerful nations in the region, who, up to this point have done far too little.  Saudi Arabia has the 3rd largest defense budget in the world, yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait, a country whose ruling family was restored to power by U.S. troops after the first Gulf War, has been a well-known source of financing for ISIS and other violent extremists. It has been reported that Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup, including the construction of an enormous number of facilities to host that event – $200 billion on hosting a soccer event, yet very little to fight against ISIS. Worse still, it has been widely reported that the government has not been vigilant in stemming the flow of terrorist financing, and that Qatari individuals and organizations funnel money to some of the most extreme terrorist groups, including al Nusra and ISIS.  All of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them. As we develop a strongly coordinated effort, we need a commitment from these countries that the fight against ISIS takes precedence over the religious and ideological differences that hamper the kind of cooperation that we desperately need.  Further, we all understand that Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator who has slaughtered many of his own people. I am pleased that we saw last weekend diplomats from all over world, known as the International Syria Support Group, set a timetable for a Syrian-led political transition with open and fair elections. These are the promising beginnings of a collective effort to end the bloodshed and to move to political transition.  The diplomatic plan for Assad’s transition from power is a good step in a united front. But our priority must be to defeat ISIS. Nations all over the world, who share a common interest in protecting themselves against international terrorist, must make the destruction of ISIS the highest priority. Nations in the region must commit – that instead of turning a blind eye — they will commit their resources to preventing the free flow of terrorist finances and fighters to Syria and Iraq. We need a commitment that they will counter the violent rhetoric that fuels terrorism – rhetoric that often occurs within their very borders.  This is the model in which we must pursue solutions to the sorts of global threats we face.  While individual nations indeed have historic disputes – the U.S. and Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia – the time is now to put aside those differences to work towards a common purpose of destroying ISIS. Sadly, as we have seen recently, no country is immune from attacks by the violent organization or those whom they have radicalized.  Thus, we must work with our partners in Europe, the Gulf states, Africa, and Southeast Asia – all along the way asking the hard questions whether their actions are serving our unified purpose.  The bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed, but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone. A new and effective coalition must be formed with the Muslim nations leading the effort on the ground, while the United States and other major forces provide the support they need."
politifact368,0,The CNN Democratic presidential debate in Texas,"This is the transcript of the debate between Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on February 21, 2008 at the University of Texas in Austin.  Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate, Thursday night. more photos »  CNN's CAMPBELL BROWN: And the candidates have taken their seats. We are ready to get started. On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.  And now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.  And we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.  So please go ahead, Senator Clinton.  SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.  And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.  And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.  CLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...  (APPLAUSE)  ...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.  And another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...  (APPLAUSE)  ... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.  And as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.  CLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.  (APPLAUSE)  And 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.  So there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.  I want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.  And we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.  (APPLAUSE)  And I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.  CLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.  And there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.  (APPLAUSE)  And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead.  So, if you'll be part of this campaign, which is your really your campaign, about your futures, your families, your jobs and your health care, we'll continue to make a difference for America.  Thank you all very much.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Clinton, thank you.  BROWN: Senator Obama?  (APPLAUSE)  SEN. BARACK OBAMA: First of all, thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton. I've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.  You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.  This week, I met a couple in San Antonio, who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses, because their mortgage doubled in two weeks.  OBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.  In Youngstown, Ohio, talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China, resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart.  And all across America I'm meeting not just veterans, but also the parents of those who have fallen.  One mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.  OBAMA: Now, Senator Clinton...  (APPLAUSE)  ... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion.  But I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.  But understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.  OBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists...  (APPLAUSE)  They go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.  And so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington, that we can be straight with the American people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.  You know, Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. And she said that what the American people want is very simple: They want an America that is as good as its promise.  OBAMA: I'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise.  Thank you very much.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right, Senator Obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.  Jorge Ramos?  UNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS: Thank you very much (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).  Thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity.  The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?  CLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.  I'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.  Of course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.  I want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.  CLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.  But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.  RAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?  CLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.  But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.  BROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.  OBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.  I would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.  But I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.  And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.  BROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.  BROWN: So you've backtracked now...  OBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.  So I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.  And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?  CLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.  Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.  But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.  CLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.  And therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.  So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.  But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.  Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.  OBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: A question now on the economy.  John King?  CNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first.  I want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.  For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.  But when we ask Democrats, ""How are these two candidates different?,"" they even think they don't know.  Senator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?  OBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.  Everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.  And so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president.  Now, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.  Number one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.  (APPLAUSE)  We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...  (APPLAUSE)  ... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.  OBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.  We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.  (APPLAUSE)  On our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.  (APPLAUSE)  So these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.  OBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...  (APPLAUSE)  Now, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.  Senator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.  I think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.  The question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?  And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.  And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.  OBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.  KING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.  (APPLAUSE)  As you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, ""I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.""  The clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.  What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?  CLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.  CLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.  We're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.  We're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.  You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.  (APPLAUSE)  We will also have a different approach toward trade.  We're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.  We're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.  CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.  Everywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.  So I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.  Clean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.  We also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.  And, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...  CLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.  BROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.  And, Jorge, you have a question.  RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.  Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?  CLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.  But when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...  (APPLAUSE)  And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.  I'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.  And I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.  Finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.  If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?  OBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.  Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.  And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.  Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.  Oftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.  We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...  (APPLAUSE)  ... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.  OBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.  We have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.  We have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.  Number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.  (APPLAUSE)  And what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.  OBAMA: So we've got to fix that.  The second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.  And the problem that we have...  (APPLAUSE)  The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right, Senator Obama.  We're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.  Go ahead, John.  KING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.  KING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.  But, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.  Senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.  As president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, ""You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?""  CLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.  CLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.  (APPLAUSE)  And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.  This is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.  So what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.  I think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.  CLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...  (APPLAUSE)  ... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?  KING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?  Because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem.  (LAUGHTER)  CLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.  CLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.  I think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.  So what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.  I frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.  BROWN: All right.  CLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.  BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton.  (APPLAUSE)  Senator Obama, go ahead please.  OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.  And the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well.  (LAUGHTER)  And so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.  The one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.  OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...  (APPLAUSE)  ... to sending people back.  But what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.  And that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future.  One last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.  OBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country.  (APPLAUSE)  I want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration.  Jorge, go ahead.  RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish.  (APPLAUSE)  Many of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?  CLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.  I think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream.  You know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it.  CLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.  But I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country.  (APPLAUSE)  RAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?  OBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important.  I also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...  (APPLAUSE)  ... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.  OBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity.  But I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.  One of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.  (APPLAUSE)  And foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it.  BROWN: All right.  We're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin.  The first question now goes to John King.  KING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments.  I've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.  (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  And so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.  And, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days.  You've said, quote, ""My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions.""  You said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, ""talk versus action.""  Now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the ""Where's the beef?"" question.  But, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?  CLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.  (APPLAUSE)  You know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.  CLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.  And I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much.  And there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't.  So I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer...  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead.  BROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?  OBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...  (APPLAUSE)  ... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.  You know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.  (LAUGHTER)  And that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.  Well, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well...  (APPLAUSE)  The reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.  OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.  I'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.  OBAMA: Right.  BROWN: How do you respond?  OBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks.  I've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody.  OBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...  (APPLAUSE)  ... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and...  (APPLAUSE)  ... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it...  (LAUGHTER)  ... and they don't want...  (APPLAUSE)  What they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?  How are we going to provide health care to the American people?  How are we going to make sure that college is affordable?  So what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.  (APPLAUSE)  What I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...  (APPLAUSE)  ... so that college becomes more affordable.  OBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States.  (APPLAUSE)  So just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?  CLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition.  (APPLAUSE)  And, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think...  OBAMA: Come on.  (CROSSTALK)  CLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is.  Because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions.  Now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.  CLINTON: It is not enough to say, ""Let's come together."" We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.  You know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.  And you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference.  When I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.  And, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that.  I just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House.  CLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that.  (APPLAUSE)  But then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on...  (APPLAUSE)  When I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American.  I don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you.  Senator Obama, please respond.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care.  When I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit.  We both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.  OBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.  Now, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.  So we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.  And my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.  And so I emphasize reducing costs.  (APPLAUSE)  And as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.  OBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate.  But the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.  One last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that.  (APPLAUSE)  But I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward.  And, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate.  OBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.  The point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead.  You can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas.  Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question.  RAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, ""One of us is ready to be commander in chief.""  Are you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?  CLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide.  But I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge...  RAMOS: But I would like to come back...  CLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference.  He has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.  (APPLAUSE)  And you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary.  (APPLAUSE)  I do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference.  CLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.  (CROSSTALK)  OBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a...  (LAUGHTER)  You know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...  BROWN: Very briefly, absolutely.  OBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works.  OBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.  In some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.  (APPLAUSE)  In order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there.  BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton?  CLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, ""I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance,"" it is personal for me.  CLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree.  You know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...  OBAMA: That's right.  CLINTON: ... insure their children.  OBAMA: That's right.  CLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.  OBAMA: There's a reason.  CLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.  We would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one.  Point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.  OBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.  And it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.  But the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.  BROWN: All right. Jorge...  CLINTON: We disagree on that.  BROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one.  (LAUGHTER)  RAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?  (LAUGHTER)  Here we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important.  And here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?  CLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate...  (APPLAUSE)  I've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face.  You know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.  So we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing.  CLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that.  So when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Obama?  OBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief.  (APPLAUSE)  My number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm.  Now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.  (APPLAUSE)  Now, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.  You know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq.  OBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.  Now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.  I said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right.  On the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that.  On the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.  OBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq.  John King?  KING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.  And you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.  You both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, ""I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief"" -- your words to General Petraeus.  KING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.  Is Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?  CLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.  Now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.  CLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.  That is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.  And I would begin that with...  (APPLAUSE)  ... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.  CLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.  Last night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, ""Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home.""  And I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?  OBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.  In fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service.  But this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.  (LAUGHTER)  And I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...  (APPLAUSE)  ... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.  (LAUGHTER)  Because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America.  We contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week.  OBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.  Iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with.  So that is a debate that I'm happy to have.  One last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...  (APPLAUSE)  ... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.  OBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for.  And that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate.  Stay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.  But back to the debate.  John King?  KING: Thank you.  Both of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.  Tonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks.  And yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.  And you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?  OBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency.  OBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too.  And you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. And I've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.  OBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, ""this is the kind of spending that I think is important.""  I have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America.  KING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.  Senator McCain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.  On the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, ""I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president,"" on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?  CLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars...  (APPLAUSE)  ... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.  You know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.  We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America.  (APPLAUSE)  I will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.  CLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities.  And I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.  So the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.  I've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right.  An issue relating to the current election.  Jorge?  RAMOS: As we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in government, said recently, and I'm quoting, ""It would be a problem"" -- and this is a question for you, Senator Clinton -- ""it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.""  Do you agree?  CLINTON: Well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, I think that it will sort itself out. I'm not worried about that. We will have a nominee, and we will have a unified Democratic Party, and we will go on to victory in November.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead. Do you have a response to Senator Clinton?  OBAMA: Well, I think it is important, given how hard Senator Clinton and I have been working, that these primaries and caucuses count for something. And so my belief is that...  (APPLAUSE)  ... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be.  OBAMA: But understand what I think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again. They feel as if they've been shut out.  You know, when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, it's not just the desperation of that single mom. It's also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes they're hitting a brick wall.  And they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all. And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams.  And I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people.  OBAMA: And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. They want their government back, and that's what I intend to provide them when I'm nominated for president of the United States.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: We have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. You've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.  A leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. I'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.  BROWN: Senator Obama?  OBAMA: Well, you know, I wouldn't point to a single moment. But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, I was raised by a single mom. My father left when I was two, and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents.  And, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when I made mistakes and was off course. And what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.  And so, working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, I think, is the judgment that I now bring.  OBAMA: It's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: Senator Clinton?  CLINTON: Well, I think everybody here knows I've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life. And...  (APPLAUSE)  And I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans.  But people often ask me, ""How do you do it?"" You know, ""How do you keep going?"" And I just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that I've had, they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day. along with Senator McCain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war.  And I remember sitting up there and watching them come in. Those who could walk were walking. Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.  CLINTON: You know, the hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.  And I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted.  That's what gets me up in the morning. That's what motivates me in this campaign.  (APPLAUSE)  And, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Whatever happens, we're going to be fine. You know, we have strong support from our families and our friends. I just hope that we'll be able to say the same thing about the American people, and that's what this election should be about.  (APPLAUSE)  BROWN: All right, a standing ovation here in Austin, Texas. Our thanks to Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. We appreciate your time tonight.  (APPLAUSE)  And to John and Jorge as well.  We also want to thank our debate partners, the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Democratic Party, the LBJ Library as well, and the city of Austin.  END E-mail to a friend"
politifact12556,0,Donald J. Trump on the Stakes of the Election,"- June 22, 2016 -  Donald J. Trump on the Stakes of the Election  Download PDF  Today I‘d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.  People have asked me why I am running for President.  I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.  We come to work together and turn visions into reality.  We think big, and then we make it happen.  I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.  So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.  When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.  The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!  Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can’t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.  The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.  That’s why we’re asking Bernie Sanders’ voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.  Because it’s not just the political system that’s rigged. It’s the whole economy.  It’s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.  It’s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.  It’s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.  It’s rigged against you, the American people.  Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]  Brian Williams’ career was destroyed for saying far less.  Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.  I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.  We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.  This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.  Here is my promise to the American voter:  If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.  The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.  Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.  She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.  Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]  Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]  They totally own her, and that will never change.  The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.  Those are the stakes.  Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office.  Her campaign slogan is “I’m with her.”  You know what my response to that is? I’m with you : the American people.  She thinks it’s all about her.  I know it’s all about you – I know it’s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.  Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.  We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what’s good for America’s middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.  We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.  This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.  This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.  We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.  That’s what we mean by America First.  Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.  Our Founders understood this.  One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for “the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]” in America.[5]  Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:  “The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.”[6]  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton’s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]  We’ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]  Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]  Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]  Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.  In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!  The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America’s expense.  She gets rich making you poor.  Here is a quote from the book: “At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.”  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]  She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.  Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]  Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]  But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn’t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons’ NAFTA deal.  I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.  We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.  It’s not just our economy that’s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.  The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.  No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.  Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.  Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.  Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]  Hillary Clinton’s State Department refused them all.  She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.  To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]  Here is what one of the victim’s mothers had to say:  “I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don’t want this person to be president.”[16]  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.  Libya was cooperating.  Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.  Syria was under control.  Iran was being choked by sanctions.  Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.  ISIS wasn’t even on the map.  Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed  to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.  Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.  Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.  Hillary Clinton’s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]  She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora’s box of radical Islam.  Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.  ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.  In short, Hillary Clinton’s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.  It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]  Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]  But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn’t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.  She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.  In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:  “She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve  in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn’t changed a bit.”[21]  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.  In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.[22]  Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]  Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]  The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]  I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.  Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.  Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]  Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.  Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:  A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28]  Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29]  Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.[30]  Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31]  Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32]  Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33]  To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.  Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.[34]  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can’t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.  National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.  Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.  She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]  The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.  Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.  She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]  Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.  Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza’s letter:  “Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms’ way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.”  Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.  For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.  Hillary’s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can’t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.  Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:  Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton’s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.  Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs  Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many  Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas  Lift restrictions on energy production  Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.  Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.  Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.  There is one common theme in all of these reforms.  It’s going to be America First.  This is why the stakes in November are so great.  On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.  The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don’t need or want another Clinton or Obama.  Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.  They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.  Hillary Clinton’s message is old and tired. Her message is that can’t change.  My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that’s not who we are.  Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.  We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.  Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.  Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.  Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.  The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary’s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.  We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.  I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.  Our country is going to start working again.  People are going to start working again.  Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.  Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.  We are going to make America rich again.  We are going to make America safe again.  We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE .      [1] (“Sen.

E237,0,Was Michael Myers' Halloween Mask William Shatner's Face?,"Pretty much everyone knows the Halloween franchise's connection to Star Trek connection: The mask Michael Myers, the infamous Halloween villain, wears throughout the series is William Shatner's face.  It had been rumored for decades that the mask the killer Michael Myers wore in the Halloween films was in fact based on Shatner's face. Not just his face, but specifically a Captain Kirk death mask created for Star Trek. As it turns out, the anecdote is very true.  Rick Sternbach, an illustrator/designer on Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Nemesis (and a DST 2019 guest!) posted the following on his Facebook page a few years back, writing:  Red Alert!

""There are a number of historical threads through various production people over the years that validate that; I've got one of those threads here (I've told this story once or twice before). I was hired as an illustrator on Halloween 2 in 1981, working for production designer J. Michael Riva. In a supply cabinet at Pumpkin Pie Productions, we had one mask left from the original Halloween, and no idea where to get any others for the sequel. It appeared that we'd need to go check out some of the toys stores and such, but I noticed that there was some wording molded into the neck area. There was a model number, and 'Don Post Studios.' I made a call, read off the model number, and the word came back 'It's our Captain Kirk mask.' I asked if we could buy a number of them, and was told 'We'll give you a box, just give us credit.' With that, I turned the official dealings over to the higher-ups. Brush with greatness.""  As if that weren't enough to confirm that Shatner's mug indeed became that of the masked serial killer, here's an old video we found of Shatner himself discussing it — and even revealing that he went trick or treating with his daughters one Halloween wearing a Michael Myers mask.  Terrifying, right?"
E96,0,"Powdered Wig Society Barack Hussein is planning to send 250,000 Muslim refugees to the Navajo reservations of AZ and ND. Moronic!!","By Thomas Madison  UPDATE: I’m not sure where the claim that most of the wave of 250,000 Muslim refugees will be dumped on the Navajo came from. According to Roy Hobbus in the article below, the claim came directly from the State Department.  WND is reporting the same story, except they don’t mention Arizona, North Dakota, or the Navajo. WND reports that “the refugees will soon be dumped on American cities throughout the U.S.”  Whether they are being sent to Arizona, North Dakota, or a neighborhood near you, the critical question is why are they coming here at all? To become welfare parasites, forcing hard-working Americans to pay their way?  Bullsh!t, Barack Hussein! They can stay in their home countries, revolt and kick out the tyrants, and claim the oil wealth for the people. Thus they will become prosperous and content.  Step #1 is summoning the courage to stand up and fight. That’s the way we did it!  From Roy Hobbus, Real News Right Now  WINDOW ROCK, Az. – The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will grant upwards of two-hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees temporary amnesty in the United States. Over the next four months, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will begin processing and transporting the refugees to sparsely populated parts of Arizona and North Dakota.  “Due to the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the Middle East, the United States has agreed to facilitate the transfer of a number of Syrian refugees to the Navajo and Standing Rock reservations where they will be provided with food, shelter, and medical treatment,” Cathy Pieper, a spokesperson for the Department of State, said Friday.  Pieper said the tribal leadership of the Navajo and Standing Rock territories respectively, will hold sole responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of the refugees. “Due in part to shared experiences, we believe Syrian refugees will find it relatively easy to assimilate themselves into the native culture,” Pieper said.  Ahmed Alsouki, who, along with his wife and two children, was one of the first Syrians to be granted temporary amnesty by the United States, told Vice News he feels very fortunate about the situation. “Before the war I was an entrepreneur,” Alsouki said. “I traveled many times to New Delhi on business, so I am very familiar with the Indian way of life.”  The Obama administration’s decision to accept the refugees comes amid concerns that ISIS could use the refugee crisis as a means to infiltrate the West. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest dispelled such fears yesterday, saying the refugees will spend “very little time on American soil” prior to being placed on the reservations. “These tribal habitats are very remote,” said Earnest, who added that federal authorities are stepping up efforts to monitor all reservations within the United States for suspicious activity."
E343,0,Jewel Shuping Blinds Herself with Drain Cleaner,"""I went blind on purpose, but I don't feel it was a choice,"" Jewel Shuping said of her decision to blind herself  Woman Claims She Blinded Herself with Drain Cleaner to Fulfill Her Life-Long Dream of Being Disabled: 'I Should Have Been Blind from Birth'  Ever since she was a little girl, Jewel Shuping dreamed of being blind. The North Carolina resident was born perfectly healthy, but she became so obsessed with losing her sight that at age 21, she took matters into her own hands.  Shuping claims that she had a psychologist pour drain cleaner in her eyes, then waited to seek medical attention. Afterwards, she gradually lost her eyesight and is now almost completely blind, she says.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I really feel this is the way I was supposed to be born, that I should have been blind from birth,” the 30-year-old says.  Shuping has Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) – a rare condition causing able-bodied people to believe they are supposed to be disabled. She has long fantasized about being blind.  “When I was young, my mother would find me walking in the halls at night. When I was 3 or 4 years old,” Shuping recalls. “By the time I was 6 I remember that thinking about being blind made me feel comfortable.”  Shuping acquired a white cane in her teens and could read Braille fluently by the time she was 20. As the years progressed, so did her desire to be blind.  So, she decided to take matters into her own hands. In 2006, Shuping claims she found a sympathetic psychologist who agreed to pour drain cleaner into her eyes (the two first met for a few weeks to make sure Shuping was ready).  “It hurt, let me tell you. My eyes were screaming and I had some drain cleaner going down my cheek burning my skin,” Shuping says. “All I could think was, ‘I am going blind, it is going to be okay.’ ”  The two waited for 30 minutes before going to a hospital, where doctors worked to save Shuping’s eyesight. But the permanent damage was already done and, over the next six months, Shuping’s eyesight gradually faded.  Shuping has refused to name the psychologist who she says helped her blind herself.  “I was so happy, I felt that this was who I was supposed to be,” Shuping explains.  Shuping’s decision to blind herself put a strain on her relationship with her family. She initially told them she lost her eyesight in an accident, but upon learning the truth, Shuping’s mother and sister cut off contact with the her, she claims.  However, Shuping says she has never been happier and does not regret her decision – although she does not recommend her drastic method to others.  “Don’t go blind the way I did. I know there is a need, but perhaps someday there will be treatment for it,” Shuping said. “People with BIID get trains to run over their legs, freeze dry their legs or fall off cliffs to try to paralyze themselves.  “It’s very dangerous. And they need professional help.”  Now Shuping, who is studying education, wants to both raise public awareness of the condition and help other blind people live independent lives.  She admitted that she understands why some people would be angry about her deliberately blinding herself. But, she says, “the way I became disabled doesn’t really matter.”"

E370,0,Oxford Junior Dictionary’s replacement of ‘natural’ words with 21st-century terms sparks outcry,"“A” should be for acorn, “B” for buttercup and “C” for conker, not attachment, blog and chatroom, according to a group of authors including Margaret Atwood and Andrew Motion who are “profoundly alarmed” about the loss of a slew of words associated with the natural world from the Oxford Junior Dictionary, and their replacement with words “associated with the increasingly interior, solitary childhoods of today”.  The 28 authors, including Atwood, Motion, Michael Morpurgo and Robert Macfarlane, warn that the decision to cut around 50 words connected with nature and the countryside from the 10,000-entry children’s dictionary, is “shocking and poorly considered” in the light of the decline in outdoor play for today’s children. They are calling on publisher Oxford University Press to reverse its decision and, if necessary, to bring forward publication of a new edition of the dictionary to do so.  The likes of almond, blackberry and crocus first made way for analogue, block graph and celebrity in the Oxford Junior Dictionary in 2007, with protests at the time around the loss of a host of religious words such as bishop, saint and sin. The current 2012 edition maintained the changes, and instead of catkin, cauliflower, chestnut and clover, today’s edition of the dictionary, which is aimed at seven-year-olds starting Key Stage Two, features cut and paste, broadband and analogue.  “We recognise the need to introduce new words and to make room for them and do not intend to comment in detail on the choice of words added. However it is worrying that in contrast to those taken out, many are associated with the interior, solitary childhoods of today. In light of what is known about the benefits of natural play and connection to nature; and the dangers of their lack, we think the choice of words to be omitted shocking and poorly considered,” the authors have written to OUP.  “When, in 2007, the OJD made the changes, this connection was understood, but less well publicised than now. The research evidence showing the links between natural play and wellbeing; and between disconnection from nature and social ills, is mounting.”  The 28 signatories to the letter, who also include Sara Maitland, Helen Macdonald and Ruth Padel, say their concern is “not just a romantic desire to reflect the rosy memories of our own childhoods onto today’s youngsters”.  “There is a shocking, proven connection between the decline in natural play and the decline in children’s wellbeing,” they write, pointing to research which found that a generation ago, 40% of children regularly played in natural areas, compared to 10% today, with a further 40% never playing outdoors. “Obesity, anti-social behaviour, friendlessness and fear are the known consequences,” they say.  The campaign has been pulled together by Laurence Rose, who works for the RSPB and who provided a list of words taken out, including hamster, heron, herring, kingfisher, lark, leopard, lobster, magpie, minnow, mussel, newt, otter, ox, oyster and panther.  “Will the removal of these words from the OJD ruin lives? Probably not,” say the authors. “But as a symptom of a widely acknowledged problem that is ruining lives, this omission becomes a major issue. The Oxford Dictionaries have a rightful authority and a leading place in cultural life. We believe the OJD should address these issues and that it should seek to help shape children’s understanding of the world, not just to mirror its trends.”  They tell the publisher “that a deliberate and publicised decision to restore some of the most important nature words would be a tremendous cultural signal and message of support for natural childhood”, and ask it to “take that opportunity, and if necessary, bring forward the next edition of the OJD in order to do so”.  Macfarlane, whose forthcoming book Landmarks, which looks at the relationship between nature and language, was originally inspired by the OJD’s changes, pointed to the response in 2008 from the head of children’s dictionaries at OUP, who said the changes had been made because: “When you look back at older versions of dictionaries, there were lots of examples of flowers for instance. That was because many children lived in semi-rural environments and saw the seasons. Nowadays, the environment has changed.”  “There’s a realism to her response – but also an alarming acceptance of the ideas that children might no longer see the seasons, that all childhoods are urban, that all cities are denatured, and that what exists beyond the city fringe or the edge of the computer screen need not be named,” said Macfarlane. “We do not care for what we do not know, and on the whole we do not know what we cannot name. Do we want an alphabet for children that begins ‘A is for Acorn, B is for Buttercup, C is for Conker’; or one that begins ‘A is for Attachment, B is for Block-Graph, C is for Chatroom’?”  Motion, the former poet laureate, said that “by discarding so many country and landscape-words from their Junior Dictionary, OUP deny children a store of words that is marvellous for its own sake, but also a vital means of connection and understanding.  “Their defence – that lots of children have no experience of the countryside – is ridiculous. Dictionaries exist to extend our knowledge, as much (or more) as they do to confirm what we already know or half-know,” said Motion.  A spokesperson for Oxford University Press said: “All our dictionaries are designed to reflect language as it is used, rather than seeking to prescribe certain words or word usages. We employ extremely rigorous editorial guidelines in determining which words [can] be included in each dictionary, based on several criteria: acknowledging the current frequency of words in daily language of children of that age; corpus analysis; acknowledging commonly misspelled or misused words; and taking curriculum requirements into account.  “The Oxford Junior Dictionary is very much an introduction to language. It includes around 400 words related to nature including badger, bird, caterpillar, daffodil, feather, hedgehog, invertebrate, ladybird, ocean, python, sunflower, tadpole, vegetation, and zebra. Many words that do not appear in the Oxford Junior Dictionary are included in the Oxford Primary Dictionary; a more comprehensive dictionary designed to see students through to age 11. Words included in this title include mistletoe, gerbil, acorn, goldfish, guinea pig, dandelion, starling, fern, willow, conifer, heather, buttercup, sycamore, holly, ivy, and conker.  “We have no firm plans to publish a new edition of the Oxford Junior Dictionary at this stage. However, we welcome feedback on all our dictionaries and feed this into the editorial process.”"
E97,0,Bill Bennett: They will kill Trump before they let him be a president.,"Interesting take on Trump  They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump. Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media.It's one for all and all for one.It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies.The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before.Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club.. . .These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone. There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don't you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don't you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama's clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right? First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists . . . so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat?you've got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth certificate. He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he's doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He's questioning our relationship with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.Good question! I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?. They recognize this could get out of control . If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked booksand Obama's records, the game is over. The gig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails, or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.That's why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump. Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one telling the truth.or(for some reason only works if you copy ^ and paste)"
E411,0,California Ranchers Discover Pig with Florescent Blue Fat,"The ranchers plan to send samples of the cotton candy-colored pork to scientists at UC Davis.  When ranchers in Morgan Hill, CA shot and cut open a wild hog, they realized what they had in front of them was much more than your average swine. The pig’s insides were a cotton-candy blue color.  A writer named GlendiTEK posted the photos of the fluorescent pig over on the website ArtBell.  GlendiTEK, who claims he is a relative of the California ranchers who found the pig, says that the animal is healthy and normal in every way—except for its blue-colored colored fat, which runs throughout its entire body.  The farmers are unsure what caused the odd-colored fat, but plan on sending samples to scientists at UC Davis to try and better understand what contributed to the otherworldly hue.  But this isn’t the first time someone has discovered odd-colored pork.  Back in 2011, ChinaSmack reported a case of glowing blue pork—but in this instance, it was the muscle and not the fat that was blue. The Chinese reporter that went to check out the glow-in-the-dark pork chops reported that the meat was still blue even after being washed, and that the color could be seen on the hands of those that handled the meat.  https://twitter.com/stompsingapore/status/578421154110550016  After a second case of the glowing blue pig meat was found in China, scientists tried to explain the phenomenon, and eventually settled on Secondary Bacterial Contamination as the cause. The same scientists concluded that the meat was safe to eat after being cooked properly.  While it’s possible that the pig in California also had bacterial contamination, the way the blue color was isolated in the pig’s fat leaves us looking for answers. Could the fat’s color be a result of a genetic defect? That was the case with Skyler, the Maine lobster pictured below.  Photo: Facebook  We’ll be waiting to hear the results from UC Davis, but until then, we’re thinking blue eggs and ham could be the next big breakfast trend.  [via ArtBell, ChinaSmack]"

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Senator Judd Gregg just blasted the president's budget director, Peter Orszag, about President Obama's proposal to use TARP funds to help community banks lend to small businesses.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. JUDD GREGG, R-N.H., BUDGET COMMITTEE: The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money, it would -- because we were borrowing it from our -- from Americans and from the Chinese -- and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt. Now that's not going to happen. We're going to -- it's become a piggy bank.  PETER ORSZAG, OMB DIRECTOR: Well, Senator...  GREGG: It's a piggy bank which adds to our deficit, adds to our debt and gets put (INAUDIBLE) tax.  ORSZAG: The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity. And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets. One of the -- and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses. It's why in this budget, we're...  GREGG: No, no, no! You can't make that type of statement with any legitimacy!  ORSZAG: OK.  GREGG: You cannot make that statement! This is the law!  ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) they're not suffering from (INAUDIBLE)  GREGG: Let me tell you what the law says!  ORSZAG: ... lack of access...  GREGG: Let me read it to you again because you don't appear to understand the law! The law is very clear! ""The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt."" It's not for a piggy bank because you're concerned about lending to small businesses...  ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) requirement (INAUDIBLE)  GREGG: ... and you want to get a political event when you go out and make a speech in Nashua, New Hampshire. That's not what this money's for! This money is to reduce the debt of our children!  (END VIDEO CLIP)  VAN SUSTEREN: Ouch! Well, for the inside story on that showdown, we went to Capitol Hill and Senator Gregg went ""On the Record.""  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, nice to see you, sir.  GREGG: Greta, thank you for having me. Thank you very much.  VAN SUSTEREN: Well, thank you for letting us come to your office.  GREGG: Appreciate you coming in.  VAN SUSTEREN: All right, today you had quite a showdown with the -- with Peter Orszag.  GREGG: Well, you know, they've sent up a budget which by their own terms is unsustainable. It puts us on a path which is basically going to lead us to fiscal insolvency as a nation, in my opinion, and I think in a lot of other people's opinion. It's a huge deficit machine, is what they've proposed, and that leads to debt. And the debt is not sustainable. It gets passed on to our kids, and basically, will lower the quality of life of our children, and that's not fair.  I feel very strongly that when you send a budget like that up, you should also send up some fairly big ideas for how you're going to address it in the out years, how you're going to keep us from going off the road, how you're going to keep us from passing on to our kids a nation that can be afforded. And there are no big ideas in this budget on the issue of fiscal discipline. None. There are some -- there are some ideas, and I support their freeze concept. But the freeze is $10 billion. Compared to a $1.6 trillion deficit, it's really not going to get us there.  VAN SUSTEREN: Well, one of the things that he brought up that, obviously, you were quite heated about, was the whole idea of taking some of the returned TARP money and giving it to community banks to the tune of $30 billion for lending. You say that that's not legal or not authorized by the statute.  GREGG: No. The way TARP was set up, you know, we borrowed this money -- we borrowed it from Americans and we borrowed it from the Chinese, and we took it and we used it to stabilize the financial industry during a severe crisis which would have basically bankrupted Main Street, had all these banks failed.  VAN SUSTEREN: So (INAUDIBLE) just set aside some cash...  GRAHAM: No, this is not in a drawer somewhere. We had to go out and borrow it. And as part of that decision, there is very clear language put in the bill -- I wrote it, that's why I know it was clear -- that said when the money comes back -- and we expected it to come back, and in many cases, coming back with interest, so we're actually making money on it -- the money has to be used, shall be used to reduce the debt. That's what the law says. That's what TARP says. That was intentionally put in there so that the money could not be used as a piggy bank for whatever the initiative is, no matter how good an idea it is.  Now the president is suggesting that he wants to take $30 billion of the paid back funds and use it for some other initiative. Well, that's not consistent with the law and it's not consistent with what we should do, basically. We should reduce the debt with this money. If we -- if we terminated TARP today, which we should, we would reduce the debt over the next couple of years by $200 billion $300 billion. That's a big chunk of debt reduction. And it -- and that's exactly what we should be doing with this TARP money. We shouldn't be using it to create a new program here, a new program there, depending on which way the wind is blowing on some given day.  VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the word that I seized upon in listening to the exchange today is ""shall."" And when I was in law school, that wasn't a word that gave you any sort of wiggle room. It just must be. How does the -- how does the White House, the administration, justify saying that they can take the returned TARP money and send it out to these community banks, this $30 billion for loans? How do they justify it?  GREGG: Well, the word is ""shall,"" and they can't do it legally.  VAN SUSTEREN: So what happens?  GREGG: So Mr. Orszag, to his credit, said they're going to change the law. You know, I mean, well, that makes no sense at all! I mean, the whole purpose here was to borrow money, put it out, stabilize the financial markets. When it gets paid back, pay down the borrowing so our kids didn't get stuck with the debt. What they're going to do is change the law so that they borrow the money, send it out to the stabilized financial institutions. When it gets paid back, they're going to spend it on something else so the debt is still out there and our kids still have to pay for it.  VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he knew the word ""shall"" was there before he showed up today?  GREGG: No.  VAN SUSTEREN: Or did you surprise him with ""shall""?  GREGG: I'm not sure whether he knew it or not, but he pretty quickly confirmed that they were going to change the law. So he probably did know, yes. I guess I probably would have to give him credit for knowing it, yes.  VAN SUSTEREN: So I take it you're not a big fan of the president's proposed budget.  GREGG: No, the budget is a disaster. It really is. It's more government, more spending and more debt. But the real problem isn't the short run. The short run's a problem. But the real problem is in the out years, there's no compression of the delta. Spending continues to go up, and taxes can never catch it because the spending is going up so fast. They're taking the size of the government from 20 percent of the Gross National Product up to 25, 26 percent of the Gross National Product. That's simply not affordable. That means you're adding a trillion dollars of debt to our kids' backs every year for the foreseeable future. And at the end of 10 years, not only is it not coming down, it's still going up!  VAN SUSTEREN: So what -- so if we were having this conversation 10 years from now, what would the economy look like, according to your prediction, assuming the president's proposed budget got passed?  GREGG: I personally think we'll hit the wall long before 10 years. I think within 5 to 7 years...  VAN SUSTEREN: What does that mean, ""hit the wall""?  GREGG: It means that people have -- the people stop buying our debt or making it very difficult for us to sell debt, that the value of the currency is affected and that you either end up with a significant inflationary event or an event where you have to so significantly raise taxes that you reduce the productivity of the entire economy and you're no longer creating jobs.  The simple situation -- the simple comparison is this. It's like a family that's been living beyond its means for many, many years and its income can never catch up with its debts. And at some point, the world community says to us, I'm sorry, we're not going to fund your debts any longer. We're simply not going to lend you the money you need.  I mean, we're not operating off our own economy's ability to support us, we're operating because China is willing to lend us money and other nations are willing to lend us money. Well, they're putting up some fairly significant red flags right now that says, We're a little concerned about all your borrowing. And if we continue this borrowing, they're going to put up very severe red flags and say, Hey, maybe we're just not going to lend you anymore, or if we do lend to you, we're going to put a price on the lending which is so expensive that it makes it very hard for you to do much else with your government besides pay down your interest.  VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, thank you, sir.  GREGG: Thank you, Greta.  (END VIDEOTAPE)"
E416,0,"Climate change denier Rupert Murdoch just bought National Geographic, which gives grants to scientists","The National Geographic magazine has been a nonprofit publication since inception in 1888, but that ends today. The long-running American publication becomes very much for-profit under a $725 million dollar deal announced today with 21st Century Fox, the entertainment company controlled by the family of Rupert Murdoch.  Murdoch is a notorious climate change denier, and his family's Fox media empire is the world's primary source of global warming misinformation. Which would be no big deal here, I guess, were it not for the fact that the National Geographic Society's mission includes giving grants to scientists.  Or had you forgotten? Here's a refresh for you, a fun little interview with Murdoch on his climate change views.  From today's deal coverage in WaPo:  The partnership, which will also include the National Geographic cable channel and the National Geographic Society's other media assets, will be called National Geographic Partners. Fox will own 73 percent of the partnership, and Washington-based National Geographic Society will own the balance. Fox will pay $725 million to the Society for its stake in the partnership. This will push the Society's endowment to more than $1 billion.  Let the ""National Geographic Covers Designed by Rupert Murdoch"" Photoshop Wars begin.  More coverage: New York Times, Variety.  20-year Nat Geo vet Declan Moore becomes CEO. Gary Knell, president-CEO of the Society, will serve as the first chairman. Buried in the press announcement:  ""The value generated by this transaction, including the consistent and attractive revenue stream that National Geographic Partners will deliver, ensures that we will have greater resources for this work, which includes our grant making programs that support scientists and explorers around the world,"" Knell said. ""As media organizations work to meet the increasing demand for high quality storytelling across multiple platforms, it's clear that the opportunity to grow by more closely aligning our branded content and licensing assets is the right path. We now will have the scale and reach to continue to fulfill our mission long into the future. The Society's work will be the engine that feeds our content creation efforts, enabling us to share that work with even larger audiences and achieve more impact. It's a virtuous cycle.""  So Rupert Murdoch will be to some large extent controlling a $1 billion organization whose stated mission includes giving grants to scientists.  Rupert Murdoch is a raging asshole, but he is also a very much on-the-record climate change denier. A climate change denier with now even more power and influence over science grants in the United States."
E246,0,Piece of space debris WT1190F on collision course with Earth in November,"Don’t worry folks… it won’t look like this (Picture: Alamy)  It’s not a catchy name, but a piece of space debris called WT1190F is on a collision course with Earth.  The unidentified piece of junk is between one and two metres in length, ready to enter earth’s atmosphere on November 13.  It’s expected to fall thorough our skies at 6.19am to the south of Sri Lanka, with any bits that don’t burn up upon entry crashing into the Indian Ocean.  The bright speck in the centre of the picture is the space junk  The junk – which could actually be from an Apollo mission – has a rather ironic name… take out the numbers and you’re left with the same question that scientists are currently trying to answer: WTF?  Some think it may be hollow – a fuel tank or some such – or of low density while others can’t wait for it to arrive so that they can carry out observations.  The object was first spotted in February 2013 but it’s been lost a couple of times, only to be re-discovered earlier this month.  Johnathan McDowell, astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said it was ‘a lost piece of space history that’s come back to haunt us.’"
E362,0,George Zimmerman retweets picture of Trayvon Martin’s corpse,"The former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman has sparked outcry after he allegedly retweeted a photograph of the unarmed black teenager he gunned down three years ago.  A Twitter user — under the handle @SeriousSlav — wrote “@TheRealGeorgeZ Z-Man is a one man army” to go with a picture of a mortally wounded Trayvon Martin.  Mr Martin was the Florida 17-year-old who was shot and killed by Mr Zimmerman on February 26, 2012. Mr Zimmerman, who was acquitted of second-degree murder, then retweeted @SeriousSlav’s picture to his 11,000 Twitter followers. The picture — which was used as evidence in the trial that ended with Zimmerman’s acquittal — shows Martin’s body lying on grass as investigators stand over it.  A poster of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was killed in Sanford, Florida in 2012 (Getty Images)  Mr Zimmerman’s retweet sparked outcry online. Twitter removed the image on Sunday, the New York Daily News reported, but the handle used by Mr Zimmerman and the person who originally posted the photograph, remain active.  “George Zimmerman is online posting pics of Trayvon Martin’s dead body right now,” rapper Talib Kweli tweeted.  Since his acquittal in the summer of 2013 over the teenager’s killing, Mr Zimmerman has had a string of run-ins with the authorities.  This summer, when someone online threatened to slap Mr Zimmerman, he tweeted: “We all know how it ended for the last moron that hit me. Give it a whirl cupcake.”"
politifact339,0,The Fact Hub,"Fact Check: Hillary’s Iowa Remarks  After months of character attacks from her opponents, Hillary responded with the facts. The following is a rundown of some of the contrasts that Hillary highlighted in her speech today in Iowa:  Hillary: “A couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. They’ve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns.”  Sen. Obama attacked Hillary. [Fact Hub, 12/3/07]  Sen. Edwards criticized Hillary for using doubletalk in the debate. ""The Democratic debate on Tuesday was a defining moment in this election. From my perspective it is important for the next president of the United States to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with Bush over the last seven years. Instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from Senator Clinton on some of the most important issues facing the American people."" [Edwards Statement, 11/3/07]  Hillary: “When it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes it’s acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I don’t think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. That’s why my health care plan covers everyone.”  Sen. Obama’s health care plan would leave 15 million uninsured. [Fact Hub, 11/19/07]  Hillary: “When it comes to social security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I don’t think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Social Security, I have always stood up against privatization and as president, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep Social Security as a sacred promise to our seniors.”  Sen. Obama refused to rule out raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for social security. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]  Sen. Obama conceded that his plan on raising the cap for social security could impact middle income people. Sen. Obama said, “Well, when I—I am going to be listening to any ideas that are presented, but I think that the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax.” When pressed on how he would structure the tax increase, “Well, it—you know, I have not specified exactly how we would structure it. Conceivably, you might have the equivalent of a doughnut hole, although this one would be a good one, as opposed to the bad doughnut hole that Bush set up for, for prescription drugs where you have a gap between people who are of middle income and very wealthy people.” [Meet the Press, 11/11/07]  Hillary: “When it comes to Iran, I took a stand for aggressive diplomacy. One of my opponents made a different choice: He didn’t show up for the vote. He didn’t speak out during a presidential debate that night. And finally, he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed – a vote for diplomacy – was really a vote for war. Well if he really thought it was a rush to war, why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote?”  Sen. Obama missed vote, and failed to speak out during a presidential debate. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07]  Sen. Obama criticized Hillary for voting to give George Bush the green light for Iran. Sen. Obama wrote, “Even worse, the Bush administration could use the language in Lieberman-Kyl to justify an attack on Iran as a part of the ongoing war in Iraq…I strongly differ with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was the only Democratic presidential candidate to support this reckless amendment.” [New Hampshire Union Leader, 10/11/07]  Hillary: “Now, there’s been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people don’t know that for legislators who don’t want to take a stand, there’s a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but ‘present’ – which is kind of like voting ‘maybe.’ Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted ‘present,’ instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women’s right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violence—one of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds.”  As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on seven abortion bills, including a ban on 'partial birth abortion,' two parental notification laws and three 'born alive' bills. [HB382, Passed 49-3-4, 5/13/1997; SB230, Passed, 44-7-5, 3/18/1997; HB1900, Passed 38-10-9, 5/16/2001; SB562, Passed 39-7-11, 4/6/2001; SB1093, Passed 34-6-12, 3/30/2001; SB1094, Passed 33-6-13, 3/30/2001; SB1095, Passed 34-5-13, 3/30/2001]  As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would increase penalties for the use of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school: The bill called for the mandatory adult persecution of a minor at least 15 years of age being tried for using a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. [SB759, Passed 52-1-5, 3/25/1999]  As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would reduce the penalty for carrying a concealed weapon from a felony to a misdemeanor. [Concurrence in House Amendments 1 and 2 to SB71, Passed 36-14-9, 5/21/1997]  Hillary: “A president can’t vote ‘present.’ A president can’t pick and choose which challenges he or she will face. My opponent’s campaign said that voting ‘present’ was a strategy to provide political cover. The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass. Well, instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass, we need a president who will take a stand. And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country.”  Chicago Tribune: Sen. Obama’s explanation for 'present' votes is questionable; 'few of the other Democrats who voted ‘present’ on abortion bills recall such a strategy' as Sen. Obama did. Sen. Obama ""said he worked out an arrangement with abortion-rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote ‘present’ on some bills if they feared a ‘no’ would look insensitive and endanger their re-election. But few of the other Democrats who voted ‘present’ on abortion bills recall such a strategy. And, like Obama, they weren't politically vulnerable."" [Chicago Tribune, 05/03/07]"
politifact13193,0,Philando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.  He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.  Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?  The answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.  The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.  The Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”  Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.  Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.  The records show no convictions for more serious crimes.  No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.  But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.  The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.  The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.  It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.  Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.  Valerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.  The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.  “Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.  But the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.  “When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”  Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.  Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.  The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.  The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.  “Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”  (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

E457,0,"Wes Craven, ‘Scream’ and ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ Director, Dies at 76","Legendary horror director Wes Craven, known for the “Scream” films and the “Nightmare on Elm Street” series, died Sunday in his Los Angeles home of brain cancer. He was 76.  Known for creating the iconic Freddy Krueger character from “Nightmare on Elm Street” and Ghostface in “Scream,” the versatile filmmaker also wrote and produced features, directed for television and wrote novels.  Craven was a humanities professor before leaving academia to work in post production and on porn movies, using a pseudonym. His first credited feature was the controversial shocker “The Last House on the Left,” which he wrote, directed and edited in 1972. He followed with the blackly comic “The Hills Have Eyes” and “Swamp Thing,” an early entry in the comic book genre.  He wrote and directed “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” with Robert Englund as Krueger and an early Johnny Depp performance, in 1984. The surreal slasher pic is credited with having started the “dream reality” style of 1980s horror filmmakers and helped launch independent film studio New Line Cinema.  “In 1984, Wes Craven brought ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ to New Line, and in so doing, altered the course of the studio’s history. We are eternally grateful to our friend and partner, and are proud to be ‘The House That Freddy Built,'” New Line said in a statement.  Bill Pullman starred in 1988’s “Serpent and the Rainbow,” which was based on a non-fiction book about voodoo. Craven tried his hand at non-horror fare between “Scream 2” and “Scream 3” with “Music of the Heart” in 1999, for which Meryl Streep was Oscar-nommed for best actress. He also wrote a novel, “The Fountain Society,” that year.  In the 1990s he pioneered the meta horror movie with film-within-a-film “Wes Craven’s New Nightmare,” then followed with “Scream” in 1996. He directed all four installments of the satirical scarer; the first grossed more than $100 million domestically. Starring Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, it became a cultural phenomenon and inspired the “Scary Movie” spoof series.  He mixed it up again with 2005 psychological thriller “Red Eye” and with a romantic comedy segment in “Paris Je t’aime,” then produced remakes of his earlier films “The Hills Have Eyes” and “The Last House on the Left.”  Craven was still actively developing projects, having recently signed an overall television deal with Universal Cable Productions. He had television projects in development including “The People Under the Stairs” with Syfy Networks, “Disciples” with UCP, “We Are All Completely Fine” with Syfy/UCP, and “Sleepers” with Federation Entertainment. He was also executive producing the new “Scream” series for MTV. His most recent films were 2010’s “My Soul to Take” and “Scream 4” in 2011.  He had recently written and was to direct the “Thou Shalt Not Kill” segment for the Weinstein Company/WGN’s “Ten Commandments” television miniseries, and had also been working on a graphic novel series based on his original idea “Coming of Rage” for Liquid Comics, in collaboration with Steve Niles. He was exec producer of “The Girl in the Photographs,” which will premiere in Toronto.  Born August 2, 1939, in Cleveland, Ohio, the longtime bird lover served as a longtime member of the Audubon California Board of Directors.  “I am heartbroken at the news of Wes Craven’s passing,” Bob Weinstein, co-chairman of the Weinstein Company and Dimension Films, said in a statement. “We enjoyed a 20 year professional relationship and more importantly a warm and close friendship. He was a consummate filmmaker and his body of work will live on forever. My brother and I are eternally grateful for all his collaborations with us.”  Craven is survived by his wife, producer and former Disney Studios VP Iya Labunka; sister Carol Buhrow; son Jonathan Craven; daughter Jessica Craven; stepdaughter Nina Tarnawksy and three grandchildren."

E178,0,"Starbucks Unveils Hanukkah, Kwanza, Church of Satan Holiday Cups","SEATTLE, WASHINGTON — Starbucks held a press conference early Monday afternoon to debut three new holiday cups that will start making their way to the coffee monolith’s stores this week. During the presser, the coffee company acknowledged the outrage among some evangelical Christians display on an annual basis, each time Starbucks’ holiday cups are unveiled.  “Yes, it’s unfortunate that we’ve angered them by taking away one of the approximately 2.3 million retailers who constantly bombard consumers with Christmas-themed messaging,” Starbucks junior media liaison Cathy Caspar said, “but we hope they’ll be suitably impressed with our new line of holiday cups as well.”  - Advertisement -  Citing a desire to “be more inclusive, no matter what certain Fundamentalists might say,” Caspar unveiled a Hanukkah, Kwanza and Church of Satan version of each Starbucks holiday cup.  “These cups will make their way to our stores this week, so no matter what you celebrate, you’ll be in the festive mood after paying $12.99 for one cup of coffee.”  Caspar said that she hopes “angry Christians will heed what their Bible says and come to the holiday season with a spirit of grace and forgiveness” and that they’ll “hoist back a $22.00 cup of coffee with their Jewish, black, or Satan worshiping friends” at their nearby Starbucks.  “Starbucks has always had a very inclusive corporate atmosphere,” Caspar said of the controversy over the standard holiday cups as well as the newly minted ones, “so I’m not really sure why all the Christians are suddenly up in arms. I mean, we are big supporters of marriage equality and we have a policy of no guns in our stores. So you’d think that eventually they’ll either all get the hint or go start a Christian-owned coffee company…Koffee-Fil-A or whatever the shit. But in the meantime, I hope they’ll stop getting shocked every time we do something that doesn’t coddle their conservative beliefs.”  - Advertisement -  Caspar said the additional coffee cups were designed in-house by various employees who are either black, Jewish, or worship Satan.  “You know it’s funny, the Jewish employees, the black employees and the Satan worshiping employees would collaborate on each other’s cups, and they’d all be laughing and having a good time,” Caspar told reporters, “and then over in a corner, all alone, were the Christians working on their own cups. I don’t know what that says or anything, but just you know, thought I’d toss that out there.”  The new cups are expected to do well in non-rural, blue states, but Caspar thinks “most people will get where Starbucks is coming from on this” and “pony up their $56.50 for their cup of coffee and be on their way.”  James‘ satire is found on: The Political Garbage Chute; HuffPost, Alternative Science, Alternative Facts, Not Really.News, The Pastiche Post, Satirical Facts, and Modern Liberals.

E86,0,"North Korean ghost boats, in deadly hunt for fish, wash up in Japan","By Ju-min Park and Kaori Kaneko SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - Fishing boats carrying decomposed corpses have washed ashore in Japan in recent weeks, leading to speculation they are rickety North Korean vessels that have strayed dangerously far from port under the impoverished nation's push to boost its catch. There has been no mention from secretive North Korea of any missing boats, but its leader, Kim Jong Un, has put a high priority on fishing as a way of earning foreign currency and providing a sustainable food source that is not reliant on harvests and weather. The Japanese coast guard and police reported 12 incidents of wrecked wooden boats, including some that were in pieces, on the country's shores and waters since October, containing 22 dead bodies, including five skulls. Japanese authorities declined to comment on the origins of the boats or the possible identities of the dead, but a hand-written sign identified one boat as belonging to unit 325 of the North Korean army, according to footage from Japan's NHK Television. Tattered cloth was found aboard the vessel that appeared to come from the North Korean flag, the video showed. Defectors and experts say fishing boats under the command of the Korean People's Army may have succumbed under pressure from Kim to catch more fish, drifting off course and ill-equipped for rough seas. TV images of some of the boats showed relatively large but otherwise primitive-looking motorized craft and the coast guard said they did not have GPS navigation systems. Those aboard could have died of starvation and exposure to the cold after getting lost. Although Japan's Meteorological Agency said there was not unusually bad weather in the Sea of Japan this November, the waters are rougher at this time of year due to the onset of cold, northwesterly winds. October through February is also prime season for squid, sandfish and king crab off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, and it is not unusual that there would be high numbers of boats at sea, said Kim Do-hoon, a professor of fisheries science at Bukyong National University in Busan. ""Kim Jong Un has been promoting the fisheries, which could explain why there are more fishing boats going out,"" he said. ""But North Korean boats perform really poorly, with bad engines, risking lives to go far to catch more. Sometimes they drift and fishermen starve to death,"" he said. DEADLY INCENTIVE SYSTEM Over the years, North Korean boats seeking the rich fishing grounds of the Sea of Japan have washed ashore in Japan as well as on the deserted beaches of the Russian Far East. North Koreans looking to defect, on the other hand, typically flee by land into China, or, less often, via coastal waters to neighboring South Korea. Fishing is a vital industry in a country where millions cannot find enough to eat. North Korea's 1.2 million-strong army is heavily engaged in food production, including fishing. ""Some of the boats belong to Korean People's Army fishery stations, possibly operating to catch sailfin sandfish,"" said An Chan-il, who served in the North's army as a junior officer before defecting to South Korea in 1979 and now heads a private think tank on North Korea in Seoul. ""Kim Jong Un is pushing hard to produce more fish. So these boats must have been stranded after overworking,"" he said. Kim, North Korea's young leader, has made boosting food production a priority for the isolated country since taking office after his father died in late 2011, and recently visited a KPA fishing station on North Korea's east coast, calling for the facility to be upgraded, the official KCNA news agency said. ""Modernization of the station will help it catch more fish, (Kim) said, adding: The station should be turned into an up-to-date fishery base which can be boasted of in the world, thus making our ongoing efforts produce good results for the service persons and civilians,"" the Nov 25 report said. Lee So-yeon, a North Korean army defector who arrived in Seoul in 2008, said fish products are a key export for North Korea's army, which hires civilian fishermen to make money. ""North Korean army units and security agencies are running many businesses to earn foreign currency from mining gold to catching fish on the west and east coasts,"" said Lee. Lee Jong-won, professor of international relations at Japan's Waseda University, added: ""The North is introducing an incentive system for producers. Fish is one of the main export products to China, which can be a way to get foreign currency…There is a possibility this incentive system led people to take more risks.""

E482,0,Did the National Cancer Institute ‘Finally Admit’ That Marijuana Kills Cancer?,"An August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a “quiet” admission that marijuana “kills cancer”:  In just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy. In fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.  That PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a “Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer” clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.  The “report” in question is the NCI’s Physician Data Query (PDQ) on “Cannabis and Cannabinoids.” The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:  The PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.  Perplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as “marijuana kills cancer.”  The earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the “overview section”:  Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)  The mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells — including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.  Since the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet “admission” of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added “quietly” in 2015 is complete fiction.  Equally made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ “prove” that cannabis “kills” cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not “prove” anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be “cured” by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:  The organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.  A major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has “no currently accepted medical use,” which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.  Further, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Government’s official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:  PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.  Because the article making the claim that the NCI “admitted” that “cannabis kills cancer” uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy, and because that information does not in any way “prove” that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer, we rank this claim as false."

E434,0,"Boy, 11, kills teen at St. Louis County home; break-in alleged","Schellman said police believe the two suspects had tried to break into the home in the Castle Point neighborhood in north St. Louis County several times Thursday.  Police said Thursday afternoon they believe the door to the home was unlocked, as there were no signs of forced entry.  Once the suspect got inside, Schellman said, the 11-year-old fired one shot and it struck the teenager in the head, fatally wounding him. His body was found in the front foyer of the home.  Schellman said the second suspect might have not have entered because the shot scared him away.  But that narrative doesn’t square with Donna Jackson, who lives across the street.  She said she saw the 11-year-old shoot the 16-year-old point-blank in the head as the two were talking on a half brick wall near the home’s front door. “It was not a break-in,” said Jackson, 45. “He shot him in the head.”  She said it was traumatic to see something like that. “There wasn’t a reason why it happened like it happened,” she said. “It was really sad.”  Another neighbor two doors down from the shooting offers a similar account."
E191,0,This Painting Of Ben Carson And Jesus in Ben Carson's Home Is The Blackest Thing I've Ever Seen This Week,"CBS Baltimore screenshot  So many questions from this picture, discovered during a recent tour of Ben Carson's home, including…  Advertisement  1. Who painted this? Do you think the people at the portrait store laughed when Ben Carson walked in and asked if someone could paint him and Black Klingon Jesus hanging out in a YMCA sauna, or do the people at the portrait store get so many requests like this that they have an artist on retainer who specializes in Black Klingon Jesus in the YMCA sauna paintings?  2. Why is Jesus a Klingon? Don't we all know that Ben Carson kinda doesn't believe in science? Or science fiction. Or history. Shouldn't this Black Klingon Jesus be, I don't know, Black Morgan Freeman Jesus, since Ben Carson likely believes the Earth is 3000 years old and Morgan Freeman is approximately that age?  Also, why does Black Klingon Jesus have hands the size of Shaq's? Even with his fingers bent, Black Klingon Jesus's hands are as big as Ben Carson's face. When he's done hanging out in the sauna with Ben Carson, Black Klingon Jesus should try out for the Sacramento Kings.  3. Did Black Klingon Jesus order his super silky Yaki lacefront on the internet, or does he have a guy deliver it to him? Asking because I know Black Klingon Jesus definitely didn't cop that in the store. The grade is too fine; the sheen is too shiny. That is some special order shit. (My guess? He had it delivered. This is Jesus after all. My Jesus aint on Ebay.)  4. Isn't a YMCA sauna one of the most boring places to stage of portrait of you and Black Klingon Jesus? If you really want to drive home the point about Jesus being your homeboy, how about a painting of Black Klingon Jesus in line at Chick-fil-A, getting eight chicken strips for you because you drank so much at brunch you're too drunk to stand in line yourself? Or that time you and Black Klingon Jesus went to Caribana, and all the hotels were booked, so he convinced one of his cousins in Toronto to let you crash for the weekend? Or that time you and Black Klingon Jesus were riding around in your car, and you got pulled over by the cops, and he told the cop the gun in the glove box was his instead of yours because he knew you already had two strikes? I'm spitballing here, but these would be much more compelling pictures than a Rondo-handed Klingon Jesus in a Brookstone robe talking to you about towels and mutual bonds.  That said, having an actual painting created of you and Black Klingon Jesus, and then hanging that picture in your home, is pretty damn Black. Kudos Ben Carson. Now take this Blackness thing to its natural extreme and catch a severe case of the itis after dinner tomorrow; an itis that makes you too tired to continue to run for president."

The advertisement promoted Daisy brand airguns (i.e., pellet rifles and BB guns) and featured several products such as the Spittin’ Image line that were not available until the 1960s.  While it’s possible that such an ad appeared in the Sears catalog at sometime in the 1960s, the only published version we’ve been able to uncover came from a 1966 issue of Boys’ Life magazine, the monthly publication for members of the Boy Scouts of America:"
E26,0,Toddlers Killed More Americans than Terrorists in 2015,"On 16 December 2015 the Facebook page “Go Left Forever” published the above-reproduced meme holding that in 2015, toddlers were responsible for the deaths of more Americans than “foreign terrorists.” The claim appeared widely in various forms of media, and its primary source being a 14 October 2015 Washington Post “Wonkblog” article that culled statistics from a manual search of news reports.  A little kid finds a gun, fires it, and hurts or kills himself or someone else. These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone, like a parent, ends up dead … But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think. After spending a few hours sifting through news reports, I’ve found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger. In 31 of those 43 cases, a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself.  As noted on the graph, the paper manually located instances in which a toddler (defined by the author as “[three] or younger”) killed someone, a task complicated by the lack of centralized records of shootings involving toddlers. The author stated that the victims (including toddlers themselves) used in compiling the numbers were shot or killed, though that information was clearly broken down visually in the graph excerpted above. By the Washington Post‘s count, as of mid-October 2015 fifteen people had died at the hands of a toddler with a gun, and at least 28 more were injured (including other toddlers).  One potentially mutable variable involves the definition of “toddler.” As with our earlier article regarding the claim that more preschoolers were shot and killed than police officers, the definition of the term “toddlers” is not universal, although it is generally accepted to encompass children between the ages of one and three.  On 29 November 2015, the Huffington Post published a follow-up article that possibly introduced more information (an additional nine toddler-involved shootings occurred by their count, bringing the total from 43 to 52 as of that date). Huffington Post also introduced the contrast of terrorism victims to toddler victims:  When that article was published on Oct 14th, there had only been 43 toddler shooting incidents. Since then, there have been 9 more, with an average of one toddler involved shooting a week  That second article complicated the data. Who had been counted by Washington Post, and who had been counted by Huffington Post? Would a similar manual search of records lead to double-counting?  We searched news reports from 14 October 2015 forward, finding several “toddler-involved shootings” with a variety of outcomes. Young children in Acworth and Jackson, Georgia found guns and shot themselves after the publication of the Washington Postpiece (neither survived); a boy in Rock Hill, South Carolina shot his grandmother but did not kill her; two-year-old Abigail Newman was shot in the neck and killed in North Carolina in late October; and a three-year-old was shot and killed by his six-year-old brother in Chicago.  Another data complication showed up in the Huffington Post‘s presentation. Their article emphasized a parallel with terrorism-related deaths and compared toddler-involved shootings with the July 2015 Chattanooga mass shooting that killed six (including the gunman). The deceased suspect in that mass shooting was in fact an American citizen (born in Kuwait) so whether an individual who was by all accounts a U.S. citizen counts as an “Islamic terrorist” is a factor of some debate that affects the compilation of data.  Huffington Post described the Chattanooga shooting as “the only” incident involving “Islamic terrorists” in the United States in 2015. At the time, that description was partly true: Suspect Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez was American but also a Muslim, and he was believed to be the sole shooter (not one of more “terrorists.“) As our earlier article indicated, law enforcement agents considered the incident under investigation and incomplete as of mid-November 2015:  On 13 November 2015, the Associated Press reported that investigators remained circumspect about Abdulazeez’s motive: “We’re still trying to make sure we understand Abdulazeez, his motivations and associations, in a really good way,” FBI Director James Comey told reporters during a visit to Nashville’s FBI field office on Friday. Comey said he understands the public interest in the shooting, but he did not know whether there would ever be a public report on it. “Sometimes the way we investigate requires us to keep information secret. That’s a good thing. We don’t want to smear people,” he said.  Thus, by November 2015 the relative body counts of foreign terrorists to toddlers were by all accounts murky and dependent on individual definitions of several terms. On 2 December 2015, a mass shooting in San Bernardino left 14 civilians and two attackers dead. By the time the meme reproduced at the top of this page was published on 15 December 2015, the shooting was still considered an active investigation and details remained fluid.  Initially, investigators adamantly asserted the motives for the shooting were unclear. Federal law enforcement agents took over the investigation within a few days, and at that point mentions of “self-radicalization” and “ISIS sympathizing” officially entered media reports.  By 16 December 2015, some of those initial reports were walked back: The Blaze reported that there was no evidence the shooters were involved in a “terror cell.” Wikipedia, which has served as a compendium of multiple reports, classified the incident as “terrorism, mass shooting, [and] workplace shooting.”  What’s more, on 16 December 2015 The Hill reported that initial claims one of the shooters publicly supported “jihad” on Facebook had been inaccurate:  The FBI said that suspected San Bernardino, Calif., shooters Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik did not express their support for jihad publicly on social media, potentially undercutting efforts to ramp up surveillance of foreign travelers’ online presences. FBI Director James Comey told reporters that there was “no evidence of a posting on social media by either of them” to reflect that they had been radicalized. The communications instead were “direct, private messages,” the FBI head said during a news conference in New York. “I’ve seen some reporting on that and that’s a garble.”  FBI Director James B. Comey said at the time that although the investigation had shown that Farook and Malik were radicalized and possibly inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, there was no indication that the couple were directed by such a group or part of a broader cell or network.  Like Abdulazeez, Malik and Farook were Muslims. But also like Abdulazeez, Farook was American, born in Chicago. Malik was Pakistani and lived in Saudi Arabia before marrying Farook, but lived in the United States as a permanent resident.  On 17 December 2015, we contacted Christopher Ingraham, the Washington Post journalist whose article inadvertently sparked all the comparison memes. Ingraham confirmed that he continued compiling information on toddler-involved shootings after publishing his October 2015 article and provided us with updated data.  Noting that “in most cases, the toddlers are killing or injuring themselves,” Ingraham counted 58 total toddler-involved shootings in 2015 as of 17 December of that year. In 19 instances toddlers shot and killed themselves, and in two others toddlers shot and killed other individuals. That brought the total of toddler-involved shooting deaths in the United States in 2015 to 21.  By contrast, if we counted both the Chattanooga shootings and San Bernardino as instances of Islamic terrorism, that would mean 19 Americans were killed in instances of suspected, reported, or potential Islamic terrorism in 2015. Counting American victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks brought that number up to 20.  Even using the broadest leeway in counting U.S. victims of “Islamic terrorism” leads to the same mathematical conclusion: More Americans were shot and killed by toddlers in 2015 than were killed by Islamic terrorists."
E115,0,GOP Ups Threats To Halt Syrian Refugees After Paris Attacks,"Bill Clark via Getty Images Heading toward a Dec. 11 government funding deadline, Republicans increased threats to attach a measure defunding Obama's refugee resettlement program to the must-pass legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks.  WASHINGTON -- Three days after terror attacks hit Paris, top Republicans in Congress threatened to exhaust all legislative tools at their disposal to stop the resettlement of thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S.  Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he would consider attaching a measure to halt the flow of refugees to an omnibus government funding bill that needs to pass Congress by Dec. 11. Doing so would complicate efforts to meet the deadline, and increase chances of a government shutdown just days before Congress plans to recess for the holidays.  Citing the Paris attacks as a reason to re-evaluate the administration’s policy on Syrian refugees, Ryan talked about one of the assailants in particular, who appeared to have traveled through Greece in October on his way to France. Reports indicate that the passport of a Syrian refugee was found near the body of the attacker, and the Greek government confirmed it was used by someone to pass through Leros, Greece.  “We’ve always been a generous nation taking in refugees, but this is a unique situation. This is a situation where you have single men coming over,” Ryan said in an interview on Bill Bennett’s “Morning in America.”  Ryan said he is directing all of the relevant committees in the House to “come up with recommendations” on how they can “immediately” address the situation.  “So we are looking at all of our options,” Ryan said, including attaching a measure restricting the administration’s plans to admit Syrian refugees to the year-end government funding bill. “What matters to me is not only do we prevent people from coming in, but we don’t bring them in. We've got to make sure we are protecting ourselves and so that is what we are looking at, what is the best option -- which is making sure that we are not complicit or even facilitating of having someone come in who would come to do us harm from Syria.”  Obama stood by his plan despite the increasing pushback from Republicans in the wake of the Paris attacks -- which the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, took credit for -- charging that “slamming the door in [refugees'] faces would be a betrayal of our values.”  But in Washington, calls for House leadership to act piled up. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said it’s “critical” the State Department “reconsider its plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the country at this time.”  Obama has said the U.S. plans to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. All would have to undergo security screenings that take 18 to 24 months.  “If the State Department fails to halt the program at this time, Congress must take measures to at least temporarily restrict funds to block the refugee program,” Meadows said in an email to The Huffington Post.  Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) echoed that sentiment, urging Ryan and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), to block funding for refugees in the upcoming budget battle.  “As you know, the president recently announced that he intends to annually allow 100,000 individuals into America through this program, many of them radical Muslims from the Middle East,” Jones wrote in a letter to Ryan on Monday. (The administration has said it would admit 85,000 refugees total for the fiscal year, 10,000 of which would be Syrian.)  Jones added that given the recent “terrible slaughter of innocent civilians” by terrorists in Paris, he “will not vote for any bill that provides funding for the Obama administration’s dangerous” resettlement plan.  On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is pushing a similar agenda, encouraging his colleagues to make sure the omnibus spending bill includes a provision requiring congressional approval for the president's refugee resettlement program.  Sessions also wants to require that the administration fully offset the costs, and identify foreigners admitted into the U.S. as refugees since 2001 who have since been involved in crime or terrorism.  “The barbaric attacks in Paris -- an assault on civilization itself -- add immense new urgency,” Sessions wrote in a letter to the Appropriations Committee on Monday.  All the senators running for the Republican presidential nomination -- Rand Paul (Ky.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), and Ted Cruz (Texas) -- also called for a stop to admitting Syrian refugees due to the Paris attacks.  Leaders on Capitol Hill are facing additional pressure from Republican governors who came out one by one on Monday against admitting refugees to their states.  Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) wrote to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, asking them to take “immediate and aggressive” action to block funding for the refugee program.  “It is our understanding that the state does not have the authority to prevent the federal government from funding the relocation of these Syrian refugees to Florida even without state support,” Scott admitted.  Piling on, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called out the new House speaker on Twitter.  If @SpeakerRyan will not lead & reject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East he needs to step down today & let someone else lead. — Gov.

E176,0,Warning: Don’t Reboil Water Ever Again!,"This happens to me at least once a week: I fill my electric kettle up with water to let it boil for my evening tea and then… well, anything can happen. I was in the middle of working on something, or the TV show I’m watching just got really good and now what?  The perfectly hot water is now regrettably cold. The solution may seem simple; just turn the kettle back on and reboil it to be enjoyed in a couple more minutes.  But what happens to water when we reboil it?  It’s something they never taught us in chemistry class but really should have. When we boil water, the chemistry of it changes, which is usually a good thing as it boils out volatile compounds and dissolves gasses. This is why boiling water mostly ensures that it’s safe to drink.  If water is left boiled too long or is reboiled, the chemical compounds change for the worst. By leaving your water to boil down, you’re actually concentrating many harmful chemicals instead of getting rid of them.  The same thing happens when you reboil water, as the compounds concentrate and increase the risk of ingesting certain chemicals.  These chemicals could include arsenic, nitrates, and fluoride. Even the minerals that are healthy for us can become dangerous when concentrated, such as calcium salt, which can lead to kidney stones and gallstones when taken excessively.  According to Dr. Anne Marie Helmenstine, she states that you can drink reboiled water in certain situations, “if you reboil water, it’s better to do it once or twice, rather than make it your standard practice. Pregnant women and persons at risk for certain illnesses may wish to avoid reboiling water rather than risk concentrating hazardous chemicals in the water.”  The Destructive Effects of Reboiled Water  1. Arsenic  “Drinking-water poses the greatest threat to public health from arsenic,” states the World Health Organization (WHO).  Exposure to arsenic may lead to arsenic toxicity, which can develop physical effects slowly over a number of years, depending on the level of exposure.  Dangers of arsenic toxicity include peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, diabetes, renal systems effects, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.  2. Nitrates  Nitrates are found naturally all over earth, in the soil, water, and air. However, the chemical can become harmful when used as a food preservative, such as in deli meats, or when exposed to high heat, such as boiling water.  When nitrates are exposed to high temperatures, they convert to nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  Nitrates have been linked to many diseases such as leukemia, non-Hodkin lymphoma, and different cancers, including colon, bladder, ovarian, stomach, pancreatic, and esophageal cancer.  3. Fluoride  Many studies have been done over the controversial chemical fluoride and its presence in drinking water. The fact is, it’s there and it could pose a threat to your health. Despite the proof of the dangerous effects of fluoride, the government insists to keep it in our water.  Harvard University took data from over 27 studies that were carried out for 22 years and linked fluoride exposure to neurological and cognitive function in children.  The results were published in the journal of Environment Health Sciences and concluded that fluoride found in drinking water resulted in lower IQ scored among children.  A more recent study completed in 2013 links fluoride to lower infertility rates in male mice."
E88,0,Leonardo DiCaprio May or May Not Get Raped by a Bear Twice in ‘The Revenant’ (UPDATE),"When the first trailer for Birdman director Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest visual experiment The Revenant dropped earlier this year, it became immediately clear that our guy Leonardo DiCaprio had achieved a new career high in terms of being a confirmed god of acting. In fact, Leo pretty much said so himself: ""It was the most difficult film, I think, that any of us have ever done,"" he said during a recent post-screening Q & A session.  Based on imagery alone, Leo would appear to be speaking the truth. Everyone looks dirty. There's a lot of screaming. And, oh yeah, there's a gigantic bear. Though pre-release clips have hinted at some sort of a violent duel between Leo and the bear, the Drudge Report is now reporting predictably anonymous claims that it's actually much worse than that:  The new movie 'REVENANT' features a shocking scene of a wild bear raping Leo DiCaprio! The explicit moment from Oscar winning director Alejandro Inarritu has caused maximum controversy in early screenings. Some in the audience escaped to the exits when the Wolf of Wall Street met the Grizzly of Yellowstone.  According to these quickly challenged reports, the bear ""flips Leo over and thrusts and thrusts during the explicit mauling,"" raping him twice. During a later scene, Leo reportedly rips open a horse and sleeps nude inside the carcass. Other cinematic scholars, however, disagree. Sleeping nude inside a horse? Yeah. Raped by a bear? Not so fast:  Quickly feeling the wrath of the bear rape rumor, a Fox spokesperson reached out to Entertainment Weekly to promptly squash the whole thing:  As anyone who has seen the movie can attest, the bear in the film is a female who attacks Hugh Glass because she feels he might be threatening her cubs. There is clearly no rape scene with a bear.  Either way, Leo: the Oscar is yours. Just reach out and grab it."
E201,0,‘I thought I was going to die:’ Arson in Sweden targets asylum seeker center,"An arson attack on accommodation for asylum seekers occurred in the small town of Munkedal in southwestern Sweden on Tuesday. The act, already condemned by the Prime Minister, is the latest in a string of similar attacks across the country.  The arsonists targeted a building housing 14 refugees. While, no one was injured in the attack, several people suffered from smoke inhalation.  “I thought I was going to die, it was horrible, but now it’s OK, I’m safe,” a Somalian refugee named Ahmet told Swedish public radio SR, as cited by AFP.  The incident provoked an outcry among Swedish politicians.  “It is very serious,” Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven told reporters, as cited by the Local. “It is not the Sweden we want to see,” he added.  Foreign Minister Margot Wallström also condemned the attack. “A civilized country like Sweden cannot accept that housing centers for asylum seekers should become prey to arsonists,” she wrote on her Twitter on Tuesday.  Amid the growing threat, Swedish authorities decided earlier on Tuesday to keep the location of refugee homes secret.

As Sweden has one of the most generous welfare systems in Europe, more asylum seekers have chosen it as their destination of choice this year, owing to the current refugee crisis, than in any year in the past. Prime Minister Löfven said on Friday that the number could exceed 150,000 by the end of the year.  LISTEN MORE:"

politifact201,0,"New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal","""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""  The politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers.  ""So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal,"" Mr. Cuomo said.  Because of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it.  Illegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup. So the racism that often compounds anti-immigrant sentiment is not as stark in New York."

E39,0,"School principal bans Santa, Thanksgiving and Pledge of Allegiance","Santa Claus is banned. The Pledge of Allegiance is no longer recited. “Harvest festival” has replaced Thanksgiving, and “winter celebrations” substitute for Christmas parties.  New principal Eujin Jaela Kim has given PS 169 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a politically correct scrub-down, to the dismay of teachers and parents.  “We definitely can’t say Christmas, nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa,” PTA president Mimi Ferrer said administrators told her. “No angels. We can’t even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.”  Kim, 33, did not return a call or email seeking comment.  A memo last month from assistant principal Jose Chaparro suggested a “harvest festival instead of Thanksgiving or a winter celebration instead of a Christmas party.” He urged staff to “be sensitive of the diversity of our families. Not all children celebrate the same holidays.”  Ninety-five percent of the 1,600 kids at PS 169 are Asian or Hispanic.  In a recent directive to all schools, the city Department of Education said it permits holiday symbols including Christmas trees, kinaras (candleholders for Kwanzaa), dreidels, Hanukkah menorahs and the Islamic star-and-crescent. Displays that “depict images of deities, religious figures or religious texts” are prohibited.  In a memo to staff this month, PS 169 business manager Johanna Bjorken added: “In case you are wondering about grey areas: Santa Claus is considered an ‘other religious figure.’ ”  But a DOE spokesman told The Post that Santa is allowed as a secular figure.  Santa was a part of the holidays at PS 169 for years. Joseph Iorio, a longtime assistant principal and the acting principal who preceded Kim, recalled state Assemblyman Felix Ortiz visiting the school dressed as Santa “many times.”  Iorio also said he tapped student leaders to lead the Pledge of Allegiance every Monday morning. When Kim arrived, the school-wide pledge ended.  ​A DOE spokesman said classrooms can recite the pledge “at the teacher’s discretion.” But PS 169 teachers said that Kim never told them they could do so.  Kim has other wacky priorities, school sources say. Soon after joining PS 169 in May 2014, her first time as a principal, she ordered the faculty to clear their classrooms of “clutter.” She moved hundreds of books and loads of supplies into the gym, where parents and other community members took what they wanted. The rest was tossed in the trash.  She also dumped boxes of newly purchased reading books in the basement because she preferred another curriculum, staffers said.  Kim bought seven 70- to 80-inch Sharp flat-screen smart TVs, which retail at about $3,000 each. After painting over and removing historic murals, she had the TVs mounted in the auditorium — three over the stage and two on each side.  “It was ridiculous,” Ferrer said. “They have never been used.”  Kim holds a lottery for students to get academic assistance after school or on Saturdays. She also started a “professional learning period” in which teachers observe each other in class, but it eliminates one period of core instruction a week for students, staffers said.​  ​​Kim recently told staff that Chancellor Carmen Fariña ​praised PS 169 at a town hall meeting."
E281,0,Marty McFly Returns!,"NEWS: Finally, after years of online hoaxing over the date, the day on which Marty McFly arrives from the past via the time-traveling DeLorean automobile in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II upon us — 21 October 2015:  In celebration of Marty’s arrival from 1985, several events are scheduled to mark “Back to the Future Day” in the U.S. on Wednesday, October 21. That day will see the premier of Back in Time, a documentary on the making of the Back to the Future trilogy, in Los Angeles and on iTunes. Fans and enthusiasts plan to visit Southern California for a retro tour of locations where Back to the Future was filmed. The town of Reston, Virginia, will rename itself Hill Valley (after the film’s fictional setting) for five days. The first Back to the Future comic book will be issued, explaining how Marty and Doc met. And some 1,700 theaters across the U.S. will host screenings of one or more of the trilogy’s films.  Universal Pictures Home Entertainment has already launched a 30th anniversary Back to the Future: The Complete Adventures limited edition set on Blu-ray and DVD, and HarperCollins has published the book Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History, chronicling of the complete story of the making of these hugely popular movies.  As noted at the Hollywood Reporter, the Back to the Future trilogy will also be screened at theaters all over the world on “Back to the Future Day,” including venues in Germany, Spain, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile.  Incidentally, the future of date of 21 October 2015 to which Marty travels supposedly does have some significance, having to do with a number of baseball predictions attributed to the film:  The reason [Marty] sets the DeLorean to Oct. 21, 2015? It’s the day 30 years in the future when the Cubs are predicted to win the World Series. Bob Gale, who scripted the 1985 original with Robert Zemeckis, said that he tried to figure out when the final game of the Series would have played: “I did my homework as a baseball fan.”  Having been swept in the 2015 National League Champion Series by the Mets, the Cubs won’t be appearing in the 2015 World Series, much less winning it."

On Tuesday, police gave an update on their status:  A 75-year-old female: gunshot wound to the shoulder — stable condition.  A 52-year-old female: gunshot wound to the foot — stable.  A 43-year-old female: gunshot wound to the leg — stable.  A 39-year-old male: minor facial injury due to gunshot – treated at hospital and discharged.  A 35-year-old pregnant female: assessed for health and welfare purposes — stable.  A 30-year-old pregnant female: assessed for health and welfare purposes — stable.  Police stormed the café in the heart of Sydney's financial district shortly after 2 a.m. local time after they heard a number of gunshots from inside, ending a siege that lasted almost 16 hours.  ""They made the call because they believed that at that time, if they didn't enter, there would have been many more lives lost,"" said New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione.  ""Until we were involved in this emergency action, we believed that no one had been injured. That changed. We changed our tactic.""  Scipione wouldn't say whether the two hostages who were killed were caught in crossfire or shot by the gunman.  Harper calls siege 'barbaric act of depravity'  [The gunman] had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. - Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott  Local media identified the hostage-taker as 50-year-old Man Haron Monis, and a police official confirmed his identity. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman ""was well known to state and Commonwealth authorities"" and had been prosecuted for sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.  ""He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" Abbott said at a news conference in Canberra Tuesday morning local time.  Abbott said Monis also posted ""graphic, extremist material"" online.  Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks at a press conference in Parliament House in Canberra early Tuesday. (Xu Haijing/Xinhua/Associated Press) ""As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL-death cult,"" Abbott said referring to the extremist group ISIS, also known as ISIL or Islamic State. ""Tragically, there are people in our community ready to engage in politically motivated violence.""  Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, issued a statement expressing condolences to the friends and families of those who died and a ""speedy recovery"" to those injured.  ""While Canada mourns with the people of Australia, we are also outraged by this barbaric act of depravity on innocent civilians who were merely going about their daily routine,"" the statement said. ""Canada and our allies will stand firm and will stand together against those who would threaten peace, freedom and democracy and all of the values we so cherish.""  No bombs found  The standoff, which began around 9:45 a.m. local time Monday, ended when a loud bang was heard from the café and five people ran out. Shortly after, police swooped in, amid heavy gunfire, shouts and flashes. A police bomb disposal robot also was sent into the building, but no explosives were found.  There were originally 17 people inside the café when the siege began.  Police said an investigation is underway because police were involved in an incident in which people died.  Monis came to Australia as a political refugee from Iran and was granted asylum. He has long been on officials' radar. Last year, he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service for using the postal service to send what a judge called ""grossly offensive"" letters to families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009.  At the time, Monis said his letters were ""flowers of advice,"" adding: ""Always, I stand behind my beliefs.""  He was later charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. Earlier this year, he was charged with the sexual assault of a woman in 2002. He has been out on bail on the charges.  One-off act, says lawyer  ""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""It's a damaged-goods individual who's done something outrageous.  ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.""  The siege began around 9:45 a.m. local time in Martin Place, a plaza in Sydney's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Many of those inside the café would have been taken captive as they stopped in for their morning coffees.  Flag in window displayed Shahada  Hundreds of police blanketed the city as streets were closed and offices evacuated. The public was told to stay away from Martin Place, site of the state premier's office, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the headquarters of two of the nation's largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away, and the landmark Sydney Opera House also is nearby.  Throughout the day, several people were seen with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the window of the café, with two people holding up a black flag with the Shahada, or Islamic declaration of faith, written on it.  The Shahada translates as ""There is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger."" It is considered the first of Islam's five pillars of faith and is similar to the Lord's Prayer in Christianity. It is pervasive throughout Islamic culture, including the green flag of Saudi Arabia. Jihadis have used the Shahada in their own black flag.  Channel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage in the café had relayed the gunman's demands. The station said police requested they not broadcast it, and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police.  A number of Australian Muslim groups condemned the hostage-taking in a joint statement and said the flag's inscription was a ""testimony of faith that has been misappropriated by misguided individuals.""  Australians show solidarity with Muslims  In a show of solidarity on Twitter, many Australians offered to accompany people dressed in Muslim clothes who were afraid of a backlash after the café siege. The hashtag #IllRideWithYou had been used more than 90,000 times by late Monday evening local time.  Seven Network television news staff watched the gunman and hostages for hours from a fourth-floor window of their Sydney offices, opposite the café.  The gunman could be seen pacing back and forth past the café's windows. Reporter Chris Reason said the man carried what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun, was unshaven and wore a white shirt and a black cap.  Some of the hostages were forced up against the windows.  ""The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,"" Reason said in a report from the vantage point. ""One woman we've counted was there for at least two hours — an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.""  ""When we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,"" he added.  Reason later reported that staff brought food from a kitchen at the rear of the café and the hostages were fed.  Lindt sends sympathies on Facebook  As night set in, the lights inside the café were switched off. Armed police guarding the area outside fitted their helmets with green-glowing night goggles.  ""This is a very disturbing incident,"" Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. ""It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.""  Lindt Australia thanked the public for its support.  ""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident, and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company wrote in a Facebook post.  There haven't been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country. - Charles Knight, lecturer, Macquarie University  Australia's government raised the country's terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the militant group ISIS, also known as Islamic State. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities — Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an ISIS leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.  ISIS, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, the group's spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, issued an audio message urging so-called lone-wolf attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all ""disbelievers,"" whether they be civilians or soldiers.  One terrorism expert said the situation appeared to be that of a ""lone wolf"" making his own demands, rather than an attack orchestrated by a foreign jihadist group.  ""There haven't been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country — that is quite positive,"" said Charles Knight, lecturer in the Department of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Australia's Macquarie University.  ""The individual or individuals involved didn't kill early, which is part of the pattern of some recent international attacks. ... It seems to be shifting more into the model of a traditional hostage situation, rather than the sort of brutal attacks we've seen overseas."""
pheme_295,0,Sydney Siege – Recap,"Heavily armed Australian police stormed a central Sydney café where a self-proclaimed cleric was holding hostages at gunpoint, ending a siege lasting more than 16 hours that had shut down large parts of the city’s business district.  It wasn’t immediately clear if any of the hostages were killed or seriously injured by two separate volleys of bullets, which followed loud explosions at around 2:15 a.m. Tuesday and several people fleeing the Lindt Chocolate Café, where the siege began Monday morning. Paramedics in ambulances arrived at the café within minutes of the standoff ending.  In a sign that authorities remained concern about the security of the site, bomb squad police entered the building with a robot in an attempt to detect possible explosives. Earlier in the siege, the gunman forced some of the hostages to film videos outlining his demands and to warn authorities that a number of bombs had been placed around Sydney. Police said earlier Monday that they were focused only on the area around the café.  The end to the standoff came about an hour after the gunman in the café was named as Man Haron Monis, a Sydney man whose website rails against perceived oppression by the U.S. and allies including Australia against Muslims.  On a website purportedly to be Mr. Haron’s, he is described as a Sydney-based Muslim cleric and activist unaffiliated with any organization or party. The website details a string of incidents involving Mr. Haron and Australian authorities.  Australian had spent hours negotiating with Mr. Haron, trying to end the tense siege. Over the course of Monday, five hostages managed to escape from the cafe. At least six more fled the building just before the outbreak of gunfire and the end of the siege.  Martin Place is a pedestrian area that connects some of the city’s main shopping areas—and isn’t far from big attractions such as the Sydney Opera House and the main ferry terminal. The incident led to the closure of a number of streets and buildings before the Christmas holiday, when the area gets especially busy.  Afroz Ali, an imam based in the predominantly Muslim suburb of Bankstown in western Sydney, described Mr. Haron as a dangerous man who had possibly snapped because of his repeated disagreements with Australian authorities.  Mr. Ali said Mr. Haron was of Iranian descent but was seen as a maverick within Sydney’s Shia community. “He is not recognized by the Shia community at all—he has been operating pretty much underground,” said Mr. Ali, who runs a series of online courses for students seeking a deeper understanding of Islam and the Quran. He was speaking just before the siege ended.  Muslim leaders and antiterror experts said Mr. Haron was likely acting alone and using global movements such as Islamic State as a cloak for his own grievances. Such attacks are worrying governments because they can be hard to track and prevent. In October, a man fatally shot a soldier at Canada’s National War Memorial before being killed inside the country’s parliament building, in a terror attack that shut down the capital city.  Throughout Monday night and into Tuesday, police continued to negotiate with Mr. Haron. Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn from the New South Wales police said negotiators were hoping “to bring about a peaceful resolution to this situation.”  In the meantime, four YouTube videos, quickly deleted by Google Inc., appeared online, showing a number of female hostages making various demands on behalf of the hostage taker in front of a black flag inscribed with the Shahadah, a profession of Muslim faith. The list of demands included for an Islamic State flag to be delivered to the cafe and for a live media interview to be arranged with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.  It wasn’t clear what prompted the police to storm the building under a hail of gunfire. Experts had predicted a drawn-out negotiation process, with negotiators alert to any sign the assailant is willing to give himself up to authorities. Still, Adam Dolnik, a professor at the University of Wollongong who has helped train New South Wales police in hostage negotiations, said police wouldn’t hesitate to use force if there was a sign the attacker might harm any of the hostages.  Australia has experienced sweeping terrorism raids recently, in addition to the police shooting of an 18-year-old Islamic State sympathizer in September. Muslim leaders fear the latest development risks igniting community tension,and may lead to acts of random retaliation. Around 70 men have had their passports confiscated in recent months due to suspicions they planned to leave the country to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, authorities say.  Early Monday, federal police arrested a 25-year-old man from a northern Sydney suburb on suspicion of financing terrorism, but police later said there was no link to the later siege.  Nail Aykan, general manager of the Islamic Council of Victoria, worried that the siege could have a “domino effect” in wider society. Australia is home to about 476,000 Muslims, many of whom fled violence in Lebanon in the 1970s and ’80s. Many built prosperous lives and worked to promote assimilation in mosques and community centers, inviting politicians to speak and holding open houses for people of other faiths.  Mr. Abbott urged people to remain calm. “The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,” he said. “We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, that there are people who would wish to do us harm. That’s why we have police and security organizations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations.”"

The last-minute announcement came amid the emergency in Ottawa, where several shootings occurred on or near Parliament Hill.  Mr. Harper was to moderate an afternoon question-and-answer session with Ms. Yousafzai at a Toronto high school.  Story continues below advertisement  He was then scheduled to head to a downtown hotel, where the 17-year-old from Pakistan was to receive honorary Canadian citizenship.  A spokesman for the Prime Minister said both events have been cancelled.  Mr. Harper sat down with Ms. Yousafzai in New York in September, 2013, while world leaders were gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.  On Tuesday, she accepted the Liberty Medal in Philadelphia, an award that is meant to honour those who strive to secure freedom for people around the world.  ""She serves as a model and an inspiration to all Canadians and to the world in her fight for universal education,"" Mr. Harper said in a motion this week to make Ms. Yousafzai an honorary Canadian citizen. The Conservative government first announced plans to make her an honorary citizen in last year's Throne Speech.

Uber briefly charged its users in downtown Sydney a minimum $100 to escape an armed hostage crisis, a result of automatic surge pricing meant to get more drivers online.  An executive in the city's Central Business District (CBD) sent Mashable screenshots of the Uber app that showed the company was charging up to four-times the normal rate because ""demand is off the charts.""  Price surging was implemented in Sydney, Australia on Dec. 15th, 2014, during a hostage siege in the CBD. Image: Mashable  ""I have never, ever seen it at four-times [the normal rate] and I'm a 1% top Uber user,"" said Matthew Leung, the user in contact with Mashable. ""I understand the way the business works — higher the demand, higher the charge — but four-times at $100 minimum is ridiculous. Almost price gouging at its worst.""  Another customer shared a screenshot of their ""wack"" fare estimate that showed a trip from an area just blocks from the siege to the airport would cost $145-185. That journey would normally cost less than $100, according to Uber's website. ""This is price surging,"" he wrote in a comment to Mashable.  After Mashable published a story on the price hikes, the company reversed course and announced that all riders in the area would be free, and that anybody who had been charged the higher amount would be refunded.  ""We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,"" Uber spokesperson Katie Curran told Mashable in a statement. ""Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely.""  Image: Uber  Any riders who were charged the higher amount may email supportsydney@uber.com to get their refund, she said, adding that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.  Uber, the company said, will now pick up the tab.  Uber Sydney's Twitter account tweeted the info.  Uber rides out of the CBD today are free for all riders to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm for more info. — Uber Sydney (@Uber_Sydney) December 15, 2014  The crisis involves at least one hostage taker and about 13 hostages, all being held in a cafe in downtown Sydney, Australia.  At present, little is known about the assailant, other than the fact that an Islamic flag was shown in the cafe window, leading some to suspect that the incident may be a terrorist attack. Police have evacuated most of the area.  Following the police evacuation, many locals have reported difficulty in finding transportation as they attempt to exit the area.  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously said the company's pricing algorithms will be ""capped"" during situations like what's unfolding in downtown Sydney. ""For each market, the state of emergency price will be set after excluding the 3 highest-priced, non-emergency days of the preceding 2 months,"" he said, adding that the policy ""intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters.""  Last July, New York's attorney general announced that Uber agreed to put a cap on prices during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” meaning natural disasters and emergencies, to comply with the state's price gouging regulations. It isn't clear if a similar agreement is in effect in Australia.  Uber launched in Australia in Oct. 2012.  Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report. Have something to add to this story?

pheme_350,0,Sydney Siege Ends: Police Storm Cafe Where Man Haron Monis Held Hostages,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner.

politifact1161,0,Topic A: How Can President Obama Regain His Political Footing?,"With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground, The Post asked political experts what he could do to regain the initiative. Below are contributions from Scott Keeter, Michael S. Berman, Newt Gingrich, Donna Brazile, Robert J. Blendon, Christine Todd Whitman, Dan Schnur, Ed Rogers, Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Gillespie.  SCOTT KEETER  Director of survey research at Pew Research Center  President Obama had a better honeymoon with the public than either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But it's over now. His ratings are approaching his electoral margin.  This summer slump is a product of his own actions and political forces outside his control. Obama campaigned for strong government action on the economy and health care, and most of his voters agreed with this direction. But Obama's efforts to expand the role of government have alienated many of those who did not vote for him but nonetheless gave him high marks when first he took office.  Pew Research's political values survey this spring showed no surge in public demand for more government. Indeed, anti-government sentiment, which had been building for years, was heightened by the financial bailout and stimulus program. Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few ""green shoots"" -- remains grim.  The health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party. Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care. Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating. Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's 1994 experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care could also be costly.  MICHAEL S. BERMAN  President of the Duberstein Group; former counsel and deputy chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale  First, the president should not over-read or over-rely on polls. To get some perspective, check out the Aug. 26 piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research entitled ""A Pollster's Advice: Don't Trust the Polls on Health Reform's Demise.""  Second, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential crisis in their personal financial ""systems."" And that he has heard the concerns raised by affected Americans nationwide. While the media attention to various town halls was in the best tradition of ""if it bleeds it leads,"" most of the people who came out did so out of a real need and interest to learn more about health-care reform proposals.  Third, invite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid to a meeting, just the three of them, and work through with them a plan for going forward. Work ""with"" the congressional leadership to come up with a single bill that represents the doable, sans the wish list of every idea for changing health care that has been suggested in the past several decades. And get to that bill before the process kind of stumbles on to it.  Finally, choose a dramatic forum, perhaps a joint session of Congress, to lay out a bill that includes core changes but reflects having heard what is bothering the people he was elected to lead.  NEWT GINGRICH  Former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives  When he returns from vacation, the president's most important assignment should be to take a deep breath and get a long-term view of the country's reaction to his policies.  Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama. His economic policies are not creating jobs. His energy tax is unlikely to pass the Senate. There is an overwhelming rejection of his spending policies.  On the international front, Afghanistan is proving much harder than expected. Iran is showing no signs of giving up its nuclear program and North Korea is still unyielding.  In this setting, the left's health program is bitterly dividing the country. Several polls have shown that more Americans expect their personal health-care situation to get worse than to get better under the plan being considered in Congress.  Still, Obama's left-wing advisers want him to undertake the revolutionary act of ramming through massive change for 17 percent of the economy under a narrow budgetary provision. This would be a statement of absolute defiance of the vast majority of Americans.  Obama faces a choice: He can attempt to run a left-wing government against the American people. Or he can govern from the center with a large majority of Americans supporting him. He can have either his left angry or the American people angry. We will know in September which choice he has made.  DONNA BRAZILE  Author and political commentator; manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign  President Obama must reset the national debate and narrow his focus on passing health-insurance reform with or without Republicans. To do this, the president must convince deficit-weary voters that reform will not send the national debt soaring and that higher taxes on the middle class are not just around the corner.  With everything in his inbox still marked urgent, the president needs to prioritize more and stop trying to do everything at once without also reminding Americans of the sacrifices involved. He should repeat: ""Remember, we're all in this together.""  Obama must also take a chapter from his campaign and begin to work on the ""new politics"" that would allow him to reach bipartisan consensus on a host of major challenges.  Much of the real anger we are seeing is economic anxiety that ordinary people are experiencing in this jobless recession. The economy is doing better, according to statistics, but nobody feels it yet. That makes for a lot of fear and worry.  The administration should also keep an eye on the stimulus spending: target funds, track job creation, rebuild the safety net, and eliminate waste and duplicity. With money so tight, no one wants to see the government spending frivolously.  ROBERT J. BLENDON  Professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's School of Public Health and its Kennedy School of Government  Most Americans do not see the president's economic policies as having been particularly successful for people like themselves, and this is leading to some skepticism about health-care reform. In fact, recent polls show most Americans do not anticipate any aspect of their health care improving if the president's health-reform proposals were enacted.  To shift this thinking requires two things: The administration's message has to change sharply, focusing on more concrete, practical aspects of reform and how it will improve typical Americans' experiences with health care. Obama needs to present over and over again five specific changes in the legislation that will help the average family, and how they will be paid for. For example, explain why changing the system so families cannot lose their insurance coverage and enacting tough insurance reforms helps families who have coverage today.  Second, the president needs to make a clear decision this fall about whether he supports a public option competing with private insurance. If so, he must explain how it would function in practice. Americans in the political center are turned off by ideological debates. After all these months, they want him to explain if it is essential and then move on to other issues they see as important.  CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN  Chair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001  If he wants to regain ground on the health-care debate, climate change and the other legislative initiatives he has identified, President Obama needs to start by rebuilding some bridges within his party. The squabbling among Democrats is bitter, with the attacks from the more liberal end of the party on the more moderate ""Blue Dog"" Democrats reaching a fever pitch. Obama might keep in mind the legacy of Sen. Edward Kennedy and reach out to those Blue Dog Democrats as well as moderate Republicans to find common ground. Kennedy was an ardent partisan with a 90 percent liberal lifetime voting rating from the liberal watchdog group Americans for Democratic Action. No one questioned his commitment to the liberal agenda or his party. Yet few senators have ever authored more bipartisan bills and were known for so consistently reaching across the aisle. The president should refuse to push through legislation on strictly partisan votes and should seek the types of bipartisan compromise he promised to broker.  DAN SCHNUR  Director of the University of Southern California's Unruh Institute of Politics; communications director for John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign  Everyone is drawing political lessons from the life and legacy of Ted Kennedy. But there is one missed opportunity in particular from Kennedy's career that Barack Obama can reflect on to get himself and his administration back on track.  Kennedy famously cited his decision to reject President Richard Nixon's health-care reform package as his greatest regret. Although Nixon's proposal was not nearly as ambitious as Kennedy would have preferred, the senator realized over the years that working with Nixon would have led to significant advancements toward his larger goals.  Fast-forward to today's battle over health care. It's clear that Obama deserves credit for moving the debate forward and achieving consensus on a number of previously intractable issues. Set aside, for now, the brawls about end-of-life counseling and a publicly funded option. If Obama signed a bill that allows individuals who change jobs to keep their insurance, forbids the denial of coverage for preexisting conditions, and deals with a lifetime cap on benefits, people will throw rose petals at his feet.  Important progress can be made now on health care; after the most significant reforms in a generation are signed into law, he can still come back to the negotiating table and continue to move forward.  ED ROGERS  Chairman of BGR Group; White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush  While the president's effectiveness is eroding, the situation is not dire. He can regain the initiative, but an eloquent speech won't do it. I assume he will not convert to conservatism and abandon his flawed plans, but he should cut his losses and get back to reality.  Occasionally all White Houses contort themselves into situations where they begin to say things they know are not true. The more you say such things, the more you have to keep saying them to try and make them true. But the Obama administration needs to face it: The president's energy bill is not a jobs bill! His health-care plans will lead to government bureaucratic decisions about individuals' heath care and will cost a fortune. The deficit is not under control. The administration should not deny the obvious or defend the indefensible. White House officials know they are losing the public debate on these issues and must scale back to what is possible and credible given America's economic circumstances -- or use brute force in Congress to pass unpopular, harmful and vast new programs.  Even if he did use his congressional majorities to win these battles, the president would lose the war by slowing economic growth, only resulting in more political pain for himself and his party. Obama doesn't have any political problems that a couple of years of 4 percent GDP growth won't solve. But he has to want it, and he needs honest policies to achieve it. Now, though, he is on a course that terrifies his political handlers and his party's candidates.  HAROLD FORD JR.  Chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council  Every president faces a time when poll numbers slide. It's easy to advise a president to ignore the numbers and plow ahead. It's not wise for a president to heed that advice blindly. Thankfully, President Obama knows that politics is about the art of the possible.  Obama is battling a stubborn recession, a Republican Congress hell-bent on defeating health reform and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. When he returns to Washington the president should forge a consensus in Congress to pass what ""is possible"" on health reform, redouble his efforts to stimulate job creation, clearly articulate our mission objectives in Afghanistan, and redefine and revive energy and financial services reform.  First he needs to win on health reform. Obama has been patient, committed and focused on leading Congress to a consensus. At his core, this president is a pragmatist. In the spirit of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, Obama should work toward winning a compromise here before taking on new reform challenges.  The compromise should be built around insurance reform, such as prohibiting companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, and guaranteeing coverage for every child in America. Such substantive health reform would put us firmly on path to solving the uninsured problem in this country when our economy gets back on track.  ED GILLESPIE  Counselor to President George W. Bush  Barack Obama faces a fundamental decision about the direction of his presidency: Try to muscle through with Democratic votes a much more liberal agenda than many of his voters expected of him, or seek more consensus-oriented policies that attract at least a slice of the House and Senate Republicans by sacrificing core liberal elements of his policies.  If he chooses the former, he risks spectacular failure or a victory that eliminates the ""postpartisan"" persona that is a critical component of his personal approval ratings. This would make it much more difficult to achieve future legislative goals, in the same way the rushed, forced passage of the stimulus bill has made his health-care policy harder to achieve. And once that critical attribute is lost, it's all but impossible to get back.  To pull his young presidency back from the brink, and protect his greatest asset, President Obama would be wise to tack back to the center and pull his congressional leadership with him. He can then return his focus to the central issue on which voters are looking to him for leadership -- turning our economy around."
E486,0,"No Asteroid Is Threatening to Hit Earth Next Month, NASA Says","There's no reason to fear a devastating asteroid strike next month, NASA experts say.  For the last few months, rumors have circulated on the Internet that a big asteroid will slam into Earth near Puerto Rico between Sept. 15 and Sept. 28, wreaking widespread destruction throughout coastal regions of the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and northern South America.  Don't believe the hype.  ""There is no scientific basis — not one shred of evidence — that an asteroid or any other celestial object will impact Earth on those dates,"" Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a statement. ""If there were any object large enough to do that type of destruction in September, we would have seen something of it by now.""  Astronomers based at the Near-Earth Object office and other institutions around the world use a variety of telescopes to hunt for potentially hazardous asteroids and comets, and they haven't observed anything that poses a serious threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, NASA officials said.  ""Again, there is no existing evidence that an asteroid or any other celestial object is on a trajectory that will impact Earth,"" Chodas stressed. ""In fact, not a single one of the known objects has any credible chance of hitting our planet over the next century.""  Experts such as Chodas must increasingly wade into the Internet's murky waters to debunk the myths swirling there.  In 2011, for example, rumors grew that the harmless comet Elenin was a ""doomsday"" object that would inflict severe damage upon the Earth. And some conspiracy theorists claimed that a cosmic impact would wipe out humanity on Dec. 21, 2012, the day that one cycle of the Mayan long-count calendar came to an end.  Just this year, fears were raised about the near-Earth asteroids 2004 BL86 and 2014 YB35, which flew harmlessly past the planet in January and March, respectively — just as NASA scientists had predicted the asteroids would.  All of this is not to claim that Earth won't get hit by a cosmic object next month. The planet is pelted by dust and chunks of space rock all the time, but almost all of this material is so small that it burns up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere.

pheme_56,0,Paris hostages run for their lives as 'at least four' in siege are dead,"Coulibaly had told police he would kill his hostages should police attempt to storm the brothers  The two brothers' hostage situation further north today ended in a similarly dramatic fashion  It comes two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi massacred 12 people at the satirical magazine offices in Paris  Advertisement  This is the dramatic moment terrified hostages ran for their lives after the siege at the Paris kosher deli ended with four other captives and the gunmen killed during the melee.  The Islamic militant had taken people, including women and children, captive and was threatening to kill them if police attempted to storm the Charlie Hebdo terrorists who, at the time, were engaged in a similar standoff with police on the eastern outskirts of the city.  An Israeli government official said 15 hostages were rescued while French president Francois Hollande confirmed that four people were killed.  Today's hostage taker Amedy Coulibaly - who was killed in the raid - was also responsible for the fatal shooting of a policewoman yesterday. It has now been suggested this attack may have been an aborted attempt to attack a Jewish school.  Scroll down for video  A victim of the siege in eastern Paris today is seen lying on the floor near the entrance to the supermarket after four hostages were killed  An armed police officer with a dog stands guard close to the entrance where a man's body lies on the floor after a raid on the kosher shop  A woman runs from the Paris kosher grocery store in tears as she is led away by French police after officers stormed the building today  A man clutches a small boy close as they flee the Hyper Cacher store where they were held hostage today (left) as a woman runs from the building in tears (right)  One woman who visited the Kosher shop described its manager Michel Emsalem as a 'kind' and 'patient' man.  Latifa Benjamaa, 37, said: 'He is kind, nice and polite. He is not someone who cares about religion. I often went to shop there and I'm a Muslim,' she said.  While it remained unclear whether the manager was involved in the incident, she added: 'This has nothing to do with religion. You are not allowed to kill in my religion. These men had an objective. These people are not doing this for Allah.'  Mrs Benjamaa said she feared people would begin rioting in the street.  She said: 'Now they are going to be repercussions. There will be war on the streets. Everyone is going to fear everyone. Before, things were fine.'  Police crowd one of the entrances to the supermarket before a burst of flames explodes, while officers hold up their riot shields as protection  Running for the lives, the hostages holed up in the grocery store for most of today included young families, women and children  A mother can only express her relief as she clutches her young son as a partner puts up his thumb to signal that the young family are okay  One of the injured hostages is carried from the supermarket on a stretcher as medics quickly attempt to treat them for their injuries  Paramedics are on the scene to treat injured hostages following the raid where it is believed at least four hostages have been killed  Police officers protect themselves with riot shields as a fiery blast explodes at the entrance to the supermarket in Porte de Vincennes  It is reported that at least one of the police officers was injured in the blast and six explosions were heard at the Jewish supermarket today  Armed police swarm the entrances and exits to the Hyper Cache in eastern Paris after several shoppers were held hostage for several hours  Officers stormed the supermarket minutes after two brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre were killed at a second siege on the outskirts of Paris  A man carrying a small child is seen fleeing from the ordeal moments after police stormed the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris  The hostages, pictured as they escape the building, were just two of many who were seen to have survived the ordeal  The man is pictured in another shot carrying the small child in his arms, while the kosher grocery behind him remains illuminated  Members of the French special forces escort a number of hostages from inside the store moments after a series of explosions were heard  Hostages are pictured piling out of the building after terrorist Coulibaly was left dead in the dramatic confrontation  Pictured is a person being taken away from the scene on a stretcher after four hostages were killed in the incident  The streets surrounding the siege are filled with ambulances and police cars in the minutes following the dramatic raid  Flash bangs and explosions explode inside the building, which is pictured moments before police (bottom right) charged inside  French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly (right). Police also named Hayat Boumeddiene (left) as helping him. However, it is no longer clear whether she was involved  Earlier today, as news of the hostage situation broke, police ordered all shops in Paris' famed Jewish district to be immediately closed.  The mayor's office in Paris announced the closures of shops along the Rosiers street in Paris' Marais neighbourhood, in the heart of the tourist district and about a kilometre away from the offices of newspaper Charlie Hebdo where 12 people were killed on Wednesday.  A 20-year-old student was among the hostages taken at the kosher shop in Paris. The young woman, whose name remains unknown, called her uncle who works nearby from the basement of the building where she was being held.  Earlier reports that there was a serious incident developing near the Trocadero in central Paris were incorrect - it remains open and running after what was a false alarm.  The siege at the grocery store occurred after the Charlie Hebdo killers in Dammartin-en-Goele found themselves holed up with a hostage at a business premises further north - and were believed to have made contact with an associate.  Police immediately scrambled phone signals in the area – but not before the killers were able to make their call.  It was feared that Said Kouachi and his brother Cheriff contacted Amedy Coulibaly – and possibly ordered him to take hostages in a bid to force police to allow them to escape.  Police officers stop two people on a scooter at gunpoint as they arrived near the scene of the hostage taking earlier today  The pair are aggressively wrestled to the ground by police officers who were tasked with preventing anyone coming and going from the scene  A building is evacuated by members of the French special forces teams after at least six people were taken hostage by the gunman  A police officer is dressed in body armour as the hostage-taker was believed to be armed with assault rifles  A police officer takes aim upwards as he mans his position at the siege in eastern Paris  Police officers take aim as they huddle behind a car after there were reports the gunman was armed with heavy weapons  Police forces were stretched as they dealt with two hostage situations across Paris simultaneously  Rows of police vans sit parked at the side of the road while a solitary officer stands guard at the outskirts of the cordon  It is not known whether Boumeddiene was in the Kosher store with Coulibaly.  As the two sieges by suspected Islamic terrorists today played out at the same time, fears grew that the jihadis were looking to cause another bloodbath.  Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, was unarmed and directing traffic in Montrouge, in south Paris, when she was gunned down by Coulibay on Thursday.  A 20-YEAR-OLD STUDENT HOSTAGE: 'SHE WAS SHOPPING AT THE TIME' A 20-year-old student was among the hostages taken at the kosher shop in Paris. The young woman, whose name remains unknown, called her uncle who works nearby from the basement of the building where she was being held. Jean-Marc Sellam, the business partner of her uncle Patrick Tuile told MailOnline that she had called her uncle 'panicked'. He said: 'The niece of my associate was taken hostage. I think there were five people taken. 'His niece is about 20 years old. She was shopping at the time. She was allowed to speak to her uncle on the phone. She said she was scared and panicked. Police have now let her uncle go to the scene.' Mr Sellam added: 'I am shocked. I have been for 48 hours. As long as they keep letting these barbaric people come back from Syria it will keep happening.' The woman taken hostage was Jewish. Advertisement  French police wearing body armour and carrying rifles stand guard at the cordoned off scene  Reports first claimed Coulibaly took at least six people hostage in the kosher grocery store but it was nearer to 20 by the time police stormed it  A hooded police officer armed with an assault rifle crosses the ring road that circles Paris at its point east, near the hostage situation  A police officer instructs residents of the Paris suburb after the area ground to a standstill when shooting broke out  A special forces team member lead residents out of the area (left) while two others patrol the cordon (right)  Two of Coulibaly's relatives were arrested in nearby Grigny during a police raid this morning.  Like the Kouachi brothers, he is known to have been radicalised by an Islamic preacher in Paris, before expressing a wish to fight in Iraq or Syria. Both Said Kouachi, 34, and his brother, Cherif Kouachi, 33, were first arrested in 2005.  They were suspected members of the Buttes Chaumont – a group operating out of the 19th arrondissement of Paris and sending terrorist fighters to Iraq.  Cherif was convicted in 2008 to three years in prison, with 18 months suspended, for his association with the underground organisation.  He had wanted to fly to Iraq via Syria, and was found with a manual for a Kalashnikov – the automatic weapon used in Wednesday’s attack.  Dozens of police officers (pictured) surrounded the kosher bakery, where a gunman took many people hostage in a raid that ended in the deaths of four innocent people  Police cordons (pictured) were established to surround the kosher bakery, where women and children were among those held captive  Three officers mobilise in the Port de Vincennes area after what is France's second hostage situation to break out in the same day  A large shield and a pole used for breaking down doors are wheeled to the scene  Said was freed after questioning by police, but – like his brother – was known to have been radicalised after the Iraq War of 2003, when Anglo-American forces deposed Saddam Hussein.  Both brothers were said to be infuriated by the killing of Muslims by western soldiers and war planes.  Vincent Olliviers, Cherif’s lawyer at the time, described him as initially being an ‘apprentice loser - a delivery boy in a cap who smoked hashish and delivered pizzas to buy his drugs.  But Mr Ollivier said the ‘clueless kid who did not know what to do with his life met people who gave him the feeling of being important.’  After his short prison sentence, Cherif was in 2010 linked with a plot to free Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, the mastermind of the1995 bombing of the St Michel metro station in Paris that killed eight people and wounded more than 100 more.  Belkacem was a leading members of the GIA, or Armed Islamic Army – an Algerian terror outfit responsible for numerous atrocities.  The Kouachi brothers, who are orphans, were radicalised by an Iman operating in northern Paris.  They were raised in foster care in Rennes, in western France, with Cherif training as a fitness instructor before moving to Paris.  They lived in the 19th arrondissement and were radicalised by Farid Benyettou, a janitor-turned-preacher who gave sermons calling for jihad in Iraq and suicide bombings.  His Buttes-Chaumont recruitment group, named after a Paris park, sent at least a dozen young men to fight in Iraq.  The Kouachis share similar backgrounds to Mohammed Merah, the 23-year-old French Algerian responsible for murdering seven people, including four Jews and three Muslim soldiers, in the Toulouse area in 2012.  Merah, who was himself shot dead by police, had also been left to operate as a terrorist in France, despite the authorities knowing he had trained with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.  Last year Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old French Algerian, was arrested in Marseille in connection with an attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels which left four people dead. He denies any crimes, and is currently on remand in Belgium.  SUSPECTED HOSTAGE TAKER A 'CLOSE ASSOCIATE' OF THE KOUACHI BROTHERS The hostage taker of the Paris terror attack is a close associate of the Kouachi brothers, who killed 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo massacre two days ago and died earlier today in a shootout with police. Sources in the Paris police said the suspected murderer Amedy Coulibay, 32, was wearing body armour and brandishing two Kalashnikov automatic weapons. It's thought that he was of Senegalese origin and attended the Addawa Mosque in Paris with the Kouachi brothers. As part of a jihadist cell with Said and Cherif Kouachi, he was involved in the failed prison break attempt of Smain Ait Ali Belkacem - the mastermind behind a wave of bombings in France in 1995 which killed eight people and wounded 120. Coulibay, who was himself jailed in 2010 for his involvement in the plot, had a long history of both petty and serious crimes. The only boy born in a family of 10 in Juvisy, Essonne, he first came to police attention as a 17-year-old delinquent. Convictions for theft and drug offences followed. In September 2002 in Orleans, Loiret, he was arrested for the armed robbery of a bank. It's believed he became involved with the younger of the Kouachi brothers, Cherif, when he was part of a jihadist recruitment ring in Paris that sent fighters to join the conflict in Iraq. Kouachi was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison. Coulibaly is thought to have become radicalised when he came under the influence of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian convicted of terrorism. Beghal was once accused of being Osama Bin Laden’s main European recruiter and has been linked with Cherif Kouachi. Coulibaly admitted to police he saw Beghal every three weeks but purely for ‘religious instruction.’ It is understood that he married Hyat Boumeddiene in a religious ceremony after she waited four years for him to come out of jail following his conviction for armed robbery. The couple were never married in a civil ceremony – the only marriage legally accepted in France.

Click here to connect to part two or part three.    Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards answered questions from CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Joe Johns and Suzanne Malveaux in a debate sponsored by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Monday night.  Hillary Clinton, left, Barack Obama, center, and John Edwards answer questions on Monday night.  JOE JOHNS, CNN: Senator Clinton, good evening.  The number-one issue for Americans of both parties is the economy, and today the news is simply not good. Markets around the world are in a tailspin because of fears of a U.S. recession. So far this year, the Dow has lost nearly 9 percent.  How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?  SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Joe, I'm glad you started with the economy, because that is the number-one issue. What's been happening in the markets, what's been happening with the home mortgage crisis, $100-a- barrel oil, so many of the issues that are really at the kitchen tables of Americans today and what they're talking to me about.  We have to stimulate the economy. I began calling for some kind of economic action plan back at the beginning of December. I have a package of $110 billion; $70 billion of that would go towards dealing with the mortgage crisis, which, unfortunately, I don't think that President Bush has really taken seriously enough.  I would have a moratorium on home foreclosures for 90 days to try to help families work it out so that they don't lose their homes. We're in danger of seeing millions of Americans become basically, you know, homeless and losing the American dream.  I want to have an interest rate freeze for five years, because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, the problem will just get compounded. And we need more transparency in the market.  Then, I think we need to give people about $650, if they qualify -- which will be millions of people -- to help pay their energy bills this winter. You know, there are so many people on fixed incomes and working people who are not going to be able to afford the spike in energy costs.  We need to make sure that we start jumpstarting the jobs in this country again. That's why I want to put money into clean energy jobs, green-collar jobs, and also make sure we have a fund that will help communities deal with the consequences of the home foreclosure crisis and make sure the unemployment system is up to the task.  And then we will have money for rebates, but let's make them the right rebates. Everything we know about President Bush's plans would leave 50 million to 70 million Americans out, because a lot of our seniors on fixed incomes don't pay income taxes. But that doesn't mean they're immune from the energy costs and the health care costs and everything else that's going up around them.  And we have a huge number of working people who thankfully don't pay income tax. They pay payroll tax. They pay a lot of other taxes. President Bush's plan would do nothing to help them.  But thankfully we've got leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus here who are going to make sure that we get the right kind of stimulus. And that's what the Democrats are going to support.  It's imperative we do it. It's a part of economic justice, which on Dr. King's holiday is part of his unfinished legacy.  WOLF BLITZER, CNN: All right.  Senator Obama?  (APPLAUSE)  SEN. BARACK OBAMA: Well, we do meet on the King holiday. And I think it's important to remember that, in the march on Washington, where Dr. King always talks about -- or it's always repeated, the dream speech that is so famous -- that march was for jobs, as well as justice.  And, unfortunately, we have not made the kind of progress that we need in having a balanced economy, and George Bush has made it worse.  George Bush has consistently skewed our tax code to the wealthy. He has squandered billions of dollars in a war that I believe should never have been authorized and should have never been waged.  (APPLAUSE)  We have not made the investments that are needed in our school system. You travel around South Carolina along the corridor of shame, and you've got children who are going to schools that were built in the 1800s. And they are not able to compete in an international economy.  So it is absolutely critical right now to give a stimulus to the economy. And Senator Clinton mentioned tax rebates. That wasn't the original focus of her plan. I think recently she has caught up with what I had originally said, which is we've got to get taxes into the -- tax cuts into the pockets of hard-working Americans right away.  And it is important for us to make sure that they are not just going to the wealthy. They should be going to folks who are making $75,000 a year or less, and they should be going to folks who only pay payroll tax, but typically are not paying income tax.  If we do that, then not only can we stimulate the economy, those are the folks who are most likely to spend money right away.  BLITZER: Do you agree with her, $650 is a good number for a tax rebate?  OBAMA: Well, I think that we are going to have to get some immediate money. What I do is I say, for a typical family, $500 for a tax rebate per family.  But also, for senior citizens, get a supplement to their Social Security check, because they get that every month. We know exactly how to do it. And that would provide seniors all across the country right away some money to help pay for their heating bills and other expenses that they've got right now.  BLITZER: Correct me if I'm wrong, Senator Edwards. Your plan does not call for a tax rebate, does it?  FORMER SEN. JOHN EDWARDS: No, that's exactly right. Can I start by saying how proud I am to be here tonight, a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus on Dr. King's holiday?  And particularly on this night, when we're honoring the legacy of Dr. King, central to his work was the idea of fighting for real equality between the races, fighting to end poverty in America, his famous Poor People's Campaign, which he was engaged in at the time of his death, fighting for garbage workers, actually, in Memphis.  And the chasm between the rich and the poor in America is wide. It is getting worse. The rich are get richer. And we've added five million people to the poverty rolls in just over the course of the last seven years, which is...  BLITZER: But what about the stimulus package?  EDWARDS: Here's what we should do. That's why I'm getting to this. What Bush does is he leaves 50 million -- as Hillary pointed out -- 50 million Americans. They're low-income Americans and moderate-income Americans. They are completely left out of the stimulus package.  If we're actually going to deal with the legacy of Dr. King, if we're going to deal with this issue of poverty -- and I have a comprehensive plan to do that, it is the cause of my life, to end poverty in this country -- we also have to include all Americans in this stimulus plan.  Now, one difference between what I have proposed and what my two colleagues have proposed is I have done something that not only stimulates the economy, but creates long-term benefits, investment in green infrastructure, which creates jobs.  Instead of just getting money out in the short term, this will actually create jobs over the long term, create green infrastructure.  Yes, we need to do something about the mortgage crisis. I want to mention one last thing.  There is one other issue that was mentioned in passing by the two of them, which is the issue of jobs. And there is a difference between myself and my colleagues on this issue of jobs, because they both supported the Peru trade deal.  My view is the Peru trade deal was similar to NAFTA. And this is crucial to the state of South Carolina...  BLITZER: But...  EDWARDS: ... no, no -- and crucial to the state of the South Carolina and jobs in South Carolina. South Carolina has been devastated by NAFTA and trade deals like NAFTA.  BLITZER: I just want to be precise. What you're proposing are really long-term objectives. In terms of a short-term stimulus package, you disagree with them on an immediate tax rebate.  EDWARDS: No, no. What I'm saying is if we do what we should do to green the economy, if we change our unemployment insurance laws, modernize them to make them available to more people, to more Americans, if we in fact give help to the states, which gets money straight into the economy and we deal with the mortgage crisis in a serious way with a home rescue fund to provide transitional financing for those people who are about to lose their homes, all those things will stimulate the economy.  BLITZER: I'll let both of you respond, but let me let Senator Obama respond first.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Let me just respond to a couple of things. I think the idea of bringing jobs is important, which is why that's central to my energy plan. But, Wolf, you're exactly right, that is a long-term agenda. That is not going to deal with the immediate crisis we have right now.  You've got the European markets dropped 5 percent. The expectation is that the Dow Jones tomorrow may do the same. We could be sliding into an extraordinary recession unless we stimulate the economy immediately. That's point number one.  Point number two, on trade, John is exactly right that you travel around South Carolina and you see the textile mills that John's father worked in closed, all over the region. And it is absolutely true that NAFTA was a mistake.  I know that Hillary on occasion has said -- just last year said this was a boon to the economy. I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal.  But the only thing I want to differ on John is this whole notion of Peru. The Peru trade deal had labor and environmental agreements in it. Peru is an economy the size of New Hampshire. Over 90 percent of the goods coming from Peru already come in under various free trade agreements.  And, John, you voted for permanent trade relations with China, which I think anybody who looks at how we structure trade in this country would tell you has been the biggest beneficiary and the biggest problem that we have with respect to trade, particularly because they're still manipulating the currency.  BLITZER: I'll let you respond, but, Senator Clinton, I want to get back to the issue of an immediate stimulus for the economy.  CLINTON: That's what I want to get back to.  BLITZER: Because who knows what the markets are going to be like tomorrow and there are a lot of people out there who are suffering already. But go ahead and respond.  CLINTON: Well, I want to just clarify a couple of points. My original plan was $70 billion in spending with a $40 billion contingency that was part of the original plan, in order to have that money available for tax rebates.  I hope that we could do it through spending, and here's why: I don't want to necessarily open up the tax code while we've got Republicans in the Senate who are going to try to come back and open up making Bush's tax cuts permanent.  (APPLAUSE)  I understand that that's a real risk. So I was hoping to be able to do it through spending, but the crisis has gotten too deep, and what happened in the markets globally today is a huge wakeup call.  The president should convene the working group on financial markets. He should ask the secretary of treasury to do this immediately. I know that there's been talking going on, but the president's proposed stimulus package is not adequate. It is too little too late and it doesn't give enough money to the people who are hardest hit by the increased costs in energy and everything else.  (APPLAUSE)  As a further point, I do believe that the green-collar job piece of this is important. That's why I have $5 billion to do it. There are programs already. Oakland, California, Mayor Dellums is working to have a green-collar job program. We could put hundreds and hundreds of young people to work right now, putting solar panels in, insulating homes.  That would give them jobs and it would move us more quickly to a green economy. And I think that if you look at this from a jobs and justice, a stimulation and long-term planning effort, we need to lay down the markers now. And that's why the Congress, under the leadership of a lot of the people who are chairs of committees and subcommittees who are here today are going to play a major role in this. And we've got to hold the line against President Bush with his ill-advised approach to stimulating the economy.  BLITZER: All right. We're staying on topic. We're staying on this subject, but I want to ask Suzanne Malveaux to ask a question and then all of you will be able to weigh...  EDWARDS: You have to give me a chance to respond to Senator Obama.  BLITZER: All right, go ahead, respond quickly and then Suzanne.  EDWARDS: Thank you.  Well, first of all, what I have proposed for green-collar jobs will create jobs within 30 or so days, so we will have an immediate impact on the economy and stimulate the economy. Second, no one has to explain to me what these trade deals have done to South Carolina, to North Carolina. My father, who's sitting right out there in the audience, worked in the mills for 36 years and we have seen what these trade deals have done to people who have worked hard all their lives.  EDWARDS: And the problem with Peru, Barack, is you are leaving the enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in the hands of George Bush.  I wouldn't trust George Bush to enforce anything, certainly no trade obligations.  (APPLAUSE)  BLITZER: All right. Ten seconds, go ahead.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Well, the only point I would make is that in a year's time, it'll be me who's enforcing them.  (APPLAUSE)  And so we're going to make sure that the right thing is being done. And, John, you tell an extraordinarily powerful story. I mean, you understand what's happened with respect to trade here and I think it is powerful when you talk about it.  But keep in mind, I first moved to Chicago to be a community organizer with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed in that region. And so I spent 3.5 years working alongside folks who had lost their jobs.  And I know what it's like for families to have put their life and their heart and soul into a company, building profits for shareholders, and then suddenly they had the rug pulled out from under them. Not only have they lost their job, they've lost their health care, they've lost their pension benefits.  And it is absolutely critical for us to understand that NAFTA was an enormous problem. The permanent trade relations with China, without some of the enforcement mechanisms that were in there, that you voted for, was also a significant problem.  And we've got to all move forward as Democrats to make sure that we've got trade deals that work for working people and not just for corporate profits.  BLITZER: All right. Suzanne Malveaux, go ahead.  (APPLAUSE)  SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN: I'd like to follow-up with Senator Obama. It was just a few days ago that Senator Clinton asserted that she was the strongest candidate when it comes to fiscal responsibility.  She says that the new programs that she proposes she essentially can pay for. She says that you have failed in that regard in the tune of some $50 billion worth of new programs that you cannot account for.  How do you respond to that charge?  OBAMA: What she said wasn't true. We account for every single dollar that we propose.  Now, this, I think, is one of the things that's happened during the course of this campaign, that there's a set of assertions made by Senator Clinton, as well as her husband, that are not factually accurate.  And I think that part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody who's going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that we've seen in Washington.  (APPLAUSE)  That is something that I hear all across the country. So when Senator Clinton says -- or President Clinton says that I wasn't opposed to the war from the start or says it's a fairytale that I opposed the war, that is simply not true.  When Senator Clinton or President Clinton asserts that I said that the Republicans had had better economic policies since 1980, that is not the case.  Now, the viewers aren't concerned with this kind of back-and- forth. What they're concerned about is who's actually going to help the get health care, how are they going to get their kids...  (APPLAUSE)  ... going to college, and that's the kind of campaign I've tried to run. I think that's the kind of campaign we should all try to run.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Well, I couldn't agree more. But I do think that your record and what you say does matter. And when it comes to...  (APPLAUSE)  ... a lot of the issues that are important in this race, it is sometimes difficult to understand what Senator Obama has said, because as soon as he is confronted on it, he says that's not what he meant.  The facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the Republicans over the last 10 to 15 years, and we can give you the exact quote.  Now, I personally think they had ideas, but they were bad ideas. They were bad ideas for America.  (APPLAUSE)  They were ideas like privatizing Social Security, like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt.  And with respect to putting forth how one would pay for all of the programs that we're proposing in this campaign, I will be more than happy, Barack, to get the information, because we have searched for it.  You have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid, a very worthy program. There is no evidence from your Web site, from your speeches, as to how you would pay for it.  Now, why is this important? It's important because I think elections are about the future. But how do you determine what will happen in the future? Well, you have to look to the record, you have to look to what we say in campaigns, and what we have done during our careers.  And I want to be just very explicit about this. We are not, neither my campaign nor anyone associated with it, are in any way saying you did not oppose the war in Iraq.  CLINTON: You did. You gave a great speech in 2002 opposing the war in Iraq. That was not what the point of our criticism was.  It was after having given that speech, by the next year the speech was off your Web site. By the next year, you were telling reporters that you agreed with President Bush in his conduct of the war. And by the next year, when you were in the Senate, you were voting to fund the war time after time after time.  BLITZER: All right.  CLINTON: So it was more about the distinction between words and action. And I think that is a fair assessment for voters to make.  (APPLAUSE)  BLITZER: OK. Thank you, Senator. Senator, we're a little off topic. I have to let Senator Obama respond, then Senator Edwards, who's going to come...  OBAMA: We're off topic, but...  BLITZER: But go ahead and respond, and then I want to get back to this issue that we're talking about, fiscal responsibility. But go ahead.  OBAMA: Let's talk about it.  Hillary, I will be happy to provide you with the information about all -- all the spending that we do. Now, let's talk about Ronald Reagan. What you just repeated here today is...  CLINTON: Barack...  OBAMA: Wait. No. Hillary, you just spoke.  CLINTON: I did not say anything about Ronald Reagan.  OBAMA: You just spoke for two minutes.  CLINTON: You said two things.  OBAMA: You just...  CLINTON: You talked about admiring Ronald Reagan and you talked about the ideas...  OBAMA: Hillary, I'm sorry. You just...  BLITZER: Senator...  CLINTON: I didn't talk about Reagan.  OBAMA: Hillary, we just had the tape. You just said that I complimented the Republican ideas. That is not true.  What I said -- and I will provide you with a quote -- what I said was is that Ronald Reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get Democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda, an agenda that I objected to. Because while I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: I was fighting these fights. I was fighting these fights. So -- but I want to be clear.  So I want to be clear. What I said had nothing to do with their policies. I spent a lifetime fighting a lifetime against Ronald Reagan's policies. But what I did say is that we have to be thinking in the same transformative way about our Democratic agenda.  We've got to appeal to Independents and Republicans in order to build a working majority to move an agenda forward. That is what I said.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: Now, you can dispute that, but let me finish.  Hillary, you went on for two minutes. Let me finish.  The irony of this is that you provided much more fulsome praise of Ronald Reagan in a book by Tom Brokaw that's being published right now, as did -- as did Bill Clinton in the past. So these are the kinds of political games that we are accustomed to.  CLINTON: Now, wait a minute.  Wolf, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just a minute.  BLITZER: Senator Edwards, let them wrap up. Then I'm going to come to you.  Yes?  CLINTON: I just want -- I just to clarify -- I want to clarify the record. Wait a minute.  EDWARDS: There's a third person in this debate.  BLITZER: Wait a minute, Senator Edwards. Hold on.  There has been a specific charge leveled against Hillary Clinton, so she can respond. Then I'll bring in Senator Edwards.  CLINTON: I just want to be sure...  OBAMA: Go ahead and address what you said about...  BLITZER: We have got a long time to. You'll have a good opportunity.  CLINTON: We're just getting warmed up.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Now, I just -- I just want to be clear about this. In an editorial board with the Reno newspaper, you said two different things, because I have read the transcript. You talked about Ronald Reagan being a transformative political leader. I did not mention his name.  OBAMA: Your husband did.  CLINTON: Well, I'm here. He's not. And...  OBAMA: OK. Well, I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Well, you know, I think we both have very passionate and committed spouses who stand up for us. And I'm proud of that.  But you also talked about the Republicans having ideas over the last 10 to 15 years.  OBAMA: I didn't say they were good ones.  CLINTON: Well, you can read the context of it.  OBAMA: Well, I didn't say they were good ones.  CLINTON: Well, it certainly...  OBAMA: All right, Wolf.  CLINTON: It certainly came across in the way that it was presented, as though the Republicans had been standing up against the conventional wisdom with their ideas. I'm just reacting to the fact, yes, they did have ideas, and they were bad ideas.  OBAMA: I agree.  CLINTON: Bad for America, and I was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Resco, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: No, no, no.  BLITZER: Hold on one second. Hold on.  Senator Edwards -- Senator Edwards has been remarkably patient during this exchange. And I want him -- I don't know if you want to get involved in this, Senator Edwards.  EDWARDS: What I want to say first is, are there three people in this debate, not two?  (APPLAUSE)  EDWARDS: And I also want to know -- I also want to know on behalf of voters here in South Carolina, this kind of squabbling, how many children is this going to get health care? How many people are going to get an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this?  EDWARDS: We have got to understand -- you know, and I respect both of my fellow candidates -- but we have got to understand this is not about us personally. It is about...  (APPLAUSE)  ... what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in.  Now, fiscal responsibility, which I think was the question. It was a little hard to tell there at the end of that. But I think the question was about fiscal responsibility.  I have proposed, I think, the most aggressive, most progressive agenda of the three of us up here. And I was the first to come out with a universal health care plan, first to come out with a global warming plan, first -- and, to the best of my knowledge, only at this point -- to come out with a comprehensive, detailed plan to end poverty in America, since we are on Dr. King's day.  This is the cause of my life. Everything I have proposed, I have come up with a way to pay for it. And I've been very explicit about how it should be paid for, not abstract, not rhetoric, very, very explicit.  But I do have to say, in response to something Senator Clinton said just a minute ago, both Senator Obama and I have said Social Security needs a solution. And we have said we won't privatize, we won't cut benefits, we won't raise the retirement age. Same thing that Hillary has said.  But she has proposed nothing about how we're going to create revenue to keep Social Security alive and talked about fiscal responsibility. Here's the problem: If you don't have -- this is not complicated. The American people understand it. If you've got more money going out than is coming in, you're going to eventually run out of money.  And you've got to have a way to pay for it, which is why -- now, let me finish this. Lord knows you let them go on forever.  (APPLAUSE)  What I'm saying is we have to be consistent in what we're saying. I have said I think Hillary doesn't want to talk about raising taxes. Let's just be honest about that.  Barack and I have both said that you've got to do something about the cap on Social Security taxes, which is now capped at $97,000. It means if somebody is making $80,000 a year, every dime of their income is taxed for Social Security. But if you are making $50 million a year, only the first $97,000 is taxed.  That's not right. And people ought to be paying their Social Security taxes. But the American people deserve to know what we're going to do.  We can disagree. There's nothing wrong with that, so they can make an informed choice, but they at least deserve to know where they stand and what we'd do.  BLITZER: We're staying on the economy, but I want Joe Johns to ask another question so we can continue this dialogue.  JOHNS: All right. Well, Senator Edwards, let's dig a little deeper on the economic mess we're in currently.  In 2006, a study from the Center for Responsible Lending found that African-Americans are something like 30 percent more likely to be sold a subprime loan than white borrowers with similar credit histories and income.  The South Carolina NAACP said last month that the American dream for too many Americans, too many African-Americans is a national nightmare. The national NAACP has even filed a class-action lawsuit against 12 nationwide lenders.  So the bottom-line question really is: Do you believe that lenders have specifically targeted African-Americans? Is this subprime mess really also an issue of race?  EDWARDS: Yes, is the answer. I think they have targeted -- if they haven't been racially motivated, I don't know. There's no way for me to know what's inside their head.  But what they have done is they have targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families. And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African- American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.  This is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.  (APPLAUSE)  That history and that legacy has consequences. And the consequence has been that African-American families are more vulnerable. They're more vulnerable to payday lenders. They're more vulnerable to predatory lenders, which is why we desperately need a national law, which I have proposed, which would crack down on these predatory payday lenders.  It's not enough to do it state-by-state, because these predators just move from place to place to place.  I was in a neighborhood in Cleveland a few months ago, one-block radius, 38 houses under foreclosure, middle-class, African-American neighborhood. These people work. They put everything they had into their homes. And they were about to lose them because these predators have come into the neighborhood and taken everything they have.  So here are the solutions. Number one, we need a national predatory lending law. Number two, we've got to help low-income families save.  EDWARDS: They have nothing to fall back on. Many have no bank account. They don't deal with financial institutions. We need to teach financial literacy, we need to match what they're able to save so that they actually have something that they can fall back on in case they get in a place where they need more money.  (APPLAUSE)  BLITZER: All right. I want both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama to respond.  But, briefly, Senator Clinton, your proposal calls for a five- year moratorium on interest rates, 90-day moratorium on foreclosure, five year keeping those interest rates the same. Alan Greenspan suggested that we simply have to let this housing crisis exhaust itself. Trying to prevent the housing markets from going down merely prolongs the agony.  Does your plan, as he would seem to be suggesting, prolong the agony?  CLINTON: No. I think it helps to mitigate the agony. I mean, what I hear as I go in and out of people's homes and talk to so many who have already lost their homes, they're in foreclosure, they see these interest rates that are about to go up and they know they can't pay them, is that we take action now.  I've been calling for action since last March. When I first started calling for it, a lot of the same economists who now say don't do anything about it said, well, it won't be that bad. We'll be able to weather the crisis.  Well, the fact is, the mortgage crisis is not only destroying the dreams of Americans for home ownership, it is having a ripple effect across the world. So my moratorium for 90 days is a work-out. It's not a bailout. I want people to be able to see whether they can stay in their homes paying a rate that is affordable for them.  And the interest rate freeze is I think merited, because look at what's happening -- if you're a big bank that helped get us into this mess, you go borrow money from Abu Dhabi or somewhere. If you're a homeowner who has been at the bottom of this incredible scheme that was established, you're left holding the bag and you don't have the house anymore.  BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.  CLINTON: So I just disagree with those who say don't try to do anything to help the people who need the help right now.  BLITZER: Senator Obama.  OBAMA: I think that we need to help them. I think it is important to make sure that we're not helping out the speculators, but instead are helping out the homeowners who are actually living in their homes, who have the capacity to make the payments if they're not seeing a huge increase in their mortgage payments.  But understand this, this is not new. We have a history in this country of preying on low-income peoples because they don't have access to banks. The Community Reinvestment Act is oftentimes not enforced as it should be.  We've got to open up bank branches. We've got to give people access to financing so that they're not going to a payday loan operation.  I two years ago introduced a provision that would eliminate predatory lending, something that I had already helped to get passed at the state level. But it is important for us to understand that we've got to give ordinary working people access to financing. And it's important to understand that part of the reason that they are borrowing on their homes, they're borrowing on credit cards, is that the banks and financial institutions have dominated policy in Washington.  And this is an area where I've got a policy disagreement with Senator Clinton. When we talked a while back, just in the last debate, we talked about the bankruptcy bill, which had been pushed by the banks and the financial institutions, that said, basically, it will be harder for folks who have been lured into these teaser rates and then see their credit cards go up to 30 percent, that they would have a tougher time getting out of bankruptcy.  In the last debate, Senator Clinton said she voted for it but hoped that it wouldn't pass. Now, I don't understand that approach to legislation. I think it is important for us to stand up to these special interests consistently, all the time, and that's what I've done and that's what I will continue to...  BLITZER: I'm going to go to Suzanne...  CLINTON: Wait, Wolf, I have to answer this.  BLITZER: I'm going to go to Suzanne Malveaux in a second, but I just want to give you a chance, Senator Obama, if you want to respond. Senator Clinton made a serious allegation that you worked for a slumlord. And I wonder if you want to respond.  OBAMA: I'm happy to respond. Here's what happened: I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project. That's what she's referring to.  Now, it's fine for her to throw that out, but the larger reason that I think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say. That is important, because if we can't, then we're not going to be able to mobilize the American people behind bringing about changes in health care reform, bringing about changes in how we're going to put people back to work, changing our trade laws. And consistency matters. Truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference.  (APPLAUSE)  And that's what I've tried to do and I will continue to try to do as president of the United States.  CLINTON: Now, let me start with the claim about the bankruptcy bill. I said very clearly I regretted voting for it and I was happy that it didn't get into law.  By 2005, there was another run at a bankruptcy reform, motivated by the credit card companies and the other big lenders. I opposed that bill. I said very forcefully I opposed that bill.  There was a particular amendment that I think is very telling. It was an amendment to prohibit credit card companies from charging more than 30 percent interest.  Senator Obama voted for it. I voted against it. It was one of the biggest lobbyist victories on that very bad bill that the bankruptcy bill represented.  And I think it's important. You know, if you look at the recent article about Senator Obama's work on health care reform in the Illinois legislature, it's a very interesting piece about how he basically did the bidding of the insurance companies during that effort.  Now, I'm just saying that if we're going to...  OBAMA: That's...  CLINTON: ... be hurling these charges against one another, I'm used to taking the incoming fire. I've taken it for 16 years. But when you get into this arena...  (APPLAUSE)  ... you can't expect to have a hands-off attitude about your record. And it is perfectly fair to have comparisons and contrasts. I voted against a 30 -- I voted for limiting to 30 percent what credit card companies could charge.  Senator Obama did not. That's a fact.  (CROSSTALK)  OBAMA: Absolutely. It is a fact, because I thought 30 percent potentially was too high of a ceiling. So we had had no hearings...  (APPLAUSE)  ... on that bill. It had not gone through the Banking Committee. I don't know about a lot of folks here, most folks here, if they've got a credit card, are paying 29 percent. So under this provision, that would've been fine.  And we had not created the kind of serious...  EDWARDS: You voted against it because the limit was too high, is that what you just said?  OBAMA: That is exactly what I just said, John, because...  EDWARDS: So there's no limit at all.  OBAMA: ... there had been no discussions...  (APPLAUSE)  Hold on, John. Hold on. Listen to this. There had been no discussion about how we were going to structure this and this was something that had not gone through the committee and we hadn't talked about.  It didn't make sense for us to cap interest rates...  CLINTON: So you voted with the credit card companies.  OBAMA: No.  CLINTON: That's the bottom line.  OBAMA: Hillary, I opposed that bill and you know I did.  (APPLAUSE)  CLINTON: Well...  OBAMA: And consistently did and unlike you and John who voted for it previously.  But here's the point. What we have to do is we've got to have consistency in how we vote. You can't say one thing during the campaign trail and then apologize afterward and say it was a mistake, and that has repeatedly happened during the course of this campaign...  (APPLAUSE)  ... and I think that tells you the kind of president that folks are going to be.  CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator Obama, it is very difficult having a straight-up debate with you, because you never take responsibility for any vote, and that has been a pattern.  You, in the -- now, wait a minute. In the Illinois state legislature...  (AUDIENCE BOOING)  CLINTON: Just a minute. In the Illinois state senate, Senator Obama voted 130 times present. That's not yes, that's not no. That's maybe. And on issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you know, voted present on keeping sex shops away from schools, voted present on limiting the rights of victims of sexual abuse, voted present time and time again.  And anytime anyone raises that, there's always some kind of explanation like you just heard about the 30 percent. It's just very difficult to get a straight answer, and that's what we are probing for.  OBAMA: I feel bad for John...  BLITZER (?): I know.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: ... because I know John's not getting a lot of time here.  Let me just respond to this.  BLITZER (?): You can...  OBAMA: I feel pretty bad, I do. I feel pretty bad. But let's just respond to the example that was just thrown out.  The bill with respect to privacy for victims of sexual abuse is a bill I had actually sponsored, Hillary. I actually sponsored the bill. It got through the senate.  (APPLAUSE)  That was on the back of 12 other provisions that I was able to pass in the state legislature. Nobody has worked harder than me in the Illinois state legislature to make sure that victims of sexual abuse were dealt with, partly because I've had family members who were victims of sexual abuse and I've got two daughters who I want to protect.  What happened on that particular provision was that after I had sponsored it and helped to get it passed, it turned out that there was a legal provision in it that was problematic and needed to be fixed so that it wouldn't be struck down.  But when you comb my 4,000 votes in Illinois, choose one...  (APPLAUSE)  ... try to present it in the worst possible light, that does have to be answered. That does have to be answered.  OBAMA: And as I said before, the reason this makes a difference -- and I understand that most viewers want to know, how am I going to get helped in terms of paying my health care? How am I going to get help being able to go to college?  All those things are important. But what's also important that people are not just willing to say anything to get elected. And...  (APPLAUSE)  BLITZER: Senator...  OBAMA: ... that's what I have tried to do in this campaign, is try to maintain a certain credibility.  I don't mind having policy debates with Senator Clinton or Senator Edwards. But what I don't enjoy is spending the week or two weeks or the last month having to answer to these kinds of criticisms that are not factually accurate.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: And the press has looked at them. They are not accurate. And you need to present them as accurate.  BLITZER: We're going to be coming back.  CLINTON: Well, that law is still on the books. It was never struck down. That was there.  BLITZER: We're going to be visiting all these subjects, but I just want Senator Edwards to weigh in. Suzanne has got an excellent question coming up.  Go ahead.  (LAUGHTER)  EDWARDS: She's been wanting to ask it, too.  Can I just ask, though, before I do -- I mean, I hear the back and forth on this one particular vote, but it is -- I do think it's important, and I mentioned this about Senator Clinton earlier, to be fair, about Social Security. I do think it's important whether you are willing to take hard positions.  I mean, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus who are sitting in front of me right know they have to go to the floor of the House every day and vote on hard issues. And they have to vote up or down or not show up to vote -- one of those three choices. What I didn't hear was an explanation for why over 100 times you voted present instead of yes or no when you had a choice to vote up or down.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: I'll be happy to answer it. Because in Illinois -- in Illinois, oftentimes you vote present in order to indicate that you had problems with a bill that otherwise you might be willing to vote for. And oftentimes you would have a strategy that would help move the thing forward.  Keep in mind, John, I voted for 4,000 bills. And if you want to know whether or not I worked on tough stuff, I passed the first racial...  EDWARDS: I don't question whether you worked on tough stuff.  OBAMA: No, no, no. Hold on a second.  EDWARDS: I don't question whether you worked on tough stuff.  OBAMA: No, no. But you...  EDWARDS: The question is, why would you over 100 times vote present? I mean, every one of us -- every one -- you've criticized Hillary. You've criticized me for our votes.  OBAMA: Right.  EDWARDS: We've cast hundreds and hundreds of votes. What you're criticizing her for, by the way, you've done to us, which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that we've cast.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: No.  EDWARDS: And what -- all I'm saying is, what's fair is fair. You have every right to defend any vote. You do.  OBAMA: Right.  EDWARDS: And I respect your right to do that on any -- on any substantive issue. It does not make sense to me -- and what if I had just not shown up...  OBAMA: John -- John, Illinois...  EDWARDS: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me finish.  OBAMA: Hold on a second.  EDWARDS: What if I had just not shown up to vote on things that really mattered to this country? It would have been safe for me politically. It would have been the careful and cautious thing to do, but I have a responsibility to take a position...  OBAMA: John, you...  EDWARDS: ... even when it has political consequences for me.  (APPLAUSE) consequences. This -- most of these were technical problems with a piece of legislation that ended up getting modified.  But let's talk about taking on tough votes. I mean, I am somebody who led on reforming a death penalty system that was broken in Illinois, that nobody thought was good politics, but was the right thing to do.  (APPLAUSE)  OBAMA: I opposed legislation that now is being used against me politically to make sure that juveniles were not put in the criminal justice system as adults, even though it was not the smart thing to do politically. It was not smart for me to oppose the war at the start of this war, but I did so because it was the right thing to do.

A number of stretchers were wheeled into the building, however, it was unclear how many people may have been injured.  According to unconfirmed reports aired by Sky News, at least four people were injured.  There was no word on the fate of the gunman, earlier identified as 50-year-old self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis.  Meanwhile, a bomb disposal robot was sent into the cafe by police.  Monis was known to police and as a self-styled preacher of Islamic State on bail for accessory to murder, as the gunman who was holding 15 terrified hostages in Sydney’s Lindt cafe.  Haron was also charged this year with indecent and sexual assault of women in 2002. Monis was hit with an additional 40 charges in October.  The 49-year-old, originally from Iran who lived in southwest Sydney, had previously sent offensive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers, calling them ‘murderers’, The Daily Telegraph says.

E694,0,Legoland Child Abduction Attempt Hoax,"This story was first published on January 13, 2014  Outline  Circulating message claims that a child went missing at Legoland but was later found with a shaved head and new clothes, drugged in a stroller, and ready to be taken out of the theme park by his would-be abductors.      Brief Analysis  There are no credible reports about such an abduction attempt. In fact, the supposed warning is just one incarnation in a long-running urban legend. From time to time, new versions of the story surface with locations and other details altered. These stories have no factual basis.  Example  To everyone who have a child, please read!!! This incident happened last sunday, at legoland. My friend’s friend family went to legoland for a holiday last sunday. While queueing up for food, she took her eyes off her 6 year old son for a moment. In just a few seconds, she realise her son was missing. Quickly she report to the legoland staff and they close down the exits in the area. The whole legoland staff was alerted and a wide search was conducted for a few hours. Finally they found her son. What was horrifying is that her son has been shaved botak, changed his clothes and shoes, and was placed in a stroller being pushed out of the place. The kid was found to be in a drowsy state, believed to be given something to smell to knock him out. Please share to warn all your relatives to be careful when bringing your family out on a holiday!!!! Please spread  Detailed Analysis  This message, which is currently circulating rapidly via social media, warns parents about a child abduction attempt that it claims took place at Legoland.  According to the message, a 6-year-old boy disappeared while his family was queuing for food at the theme park. Staff closed all exits and conducted a search for the child. The child was finally found, claims the story, with his hair cut and clothes changed and drowsy after apparently being given a drug to tranquillize him. The boy was in a stroller ready to be pushed out of the park by his abductors. Or so the tale would have us believe.  However, the claims in the message are untrue. There are no credible news or media reports about such a kidnapping attempt. The message does not say which of the several Legoland theme parks it is referring to. Nor does it specify a date or time frame other than “last Sunday”, which is meaningless. This lack of concrete details is typical of such bogus messages.        In fact, the message is just one more variant in a long-running series of bogus warnings based on the same false scenario.  Note the strong similarity to the following version, which circulated far and wide back in 2011 and 2012:  Friend of Ana’s went to Wonderland (theme park) yesterday. She was with another friend too and together they had 4 children(each 2). Kids were 4-5-6 years old. While they were busy with 1 of the 4 kids one of the other kids disappeared … Literally. 5 year old girl.    After frantically searching for 2 minutes they alerted the Park’s security who then searched the Park for the next 5-6 mins. The Park then closed all exits and would not allow anyone to leave while they continued to search for the next 45 mins.    Still they couldn’t find her and the Park was forced to re-open the exits. The Police advised Ana’s friend to focus on childrens’ shoes and nothing else. So she watched the exits and mobs of people were leaving. She noticed 1 man carrying a sleeping child with a blanket over her. And the child’s hair was a different colour but she said to the police that she had noticed a child wearing the same shoes but……. it probably wasn’t her child.    The police stopped the man and it turns out that it was indeed the right child. The child had been tranquillized by injection to the neck and was sleeping. Her hair had been cut short and had been spray painted a different colour. And all her clothing had been changed except …. her shoes. They got the perp and, thank God the child is fine.  Another version claims that a kidnapping attempt using the same scenario took place at an ASDA store in the UK. That version was also false. Other versions have been set in many shopping malls, theme parks and department stores across the United States.  In fact, David Emery from About Urban Legends notes that versions of the story go back to at least the 1980’s.  Of course, parents and guardians do need to keep an especially close eye on their children when in crowded places like shopping malls and theme parks. Child abductions do occur, and sometimes predators seize an opportunity if they notice a young child alone.  Nevertheless, sending on these false warnings will serve only to cause fear and alarm in communities and sharing them will help nobody. Moreover, the continued circulation of such false messages makes it less likely that the Internet public will believe genuine abduction alerts that may come their way.  It is high time that this old hoax was laid to rest once and for all. If you receive this or another version of the hoax, please do not share it on your networks. And please let the sender know that the message is a hoax.  Legoland Child Abduction Attempt Hoax was last modified: by  Related      "
pheme_315,0,"German Airbus crashes in French Alps with 150 dead, black box found","SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa’s Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren.  Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board.  One of the plane’s black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France’s interior minister said.  In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation.  Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines.  “We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,” Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter.  Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain’s deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard.  Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said.  Barcelona’s Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner’s Siegfried at the theater.  French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms.  Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. “We are still searching. It’s unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,” regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters.  In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: “A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.”  It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets.  It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday’s crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December.  SHARP DESCENT  Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.  “The aircraft’s contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,” Germanwings’ Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday.  Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.  France’s DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.  “The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft’s descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,” a DGAC spokesman said.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground.  The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby.  STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD  As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in.  “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters.  Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a “dark day for Lufthansa”.  “My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,” Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there.  Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff.  In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. “The families knew each other,” he told Reuters. “The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.”  King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened.  In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the “awful tragedy”.  Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France’s Safran."
politifact7665,0,A Senate in the Gun Lobby’s Grip - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  SENATORS say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.  On Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms — a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.  Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.  I watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what we’re going to hear: vague platitudes like “tough vote” and “complicated issue.” I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent around $25 million on contributions, lobbying and outside spending."
E613,0,Woman from Chicago area found dead in Texas jail cell,"A 28-year-old woman with ties to the Chicago suburbs was found dead Monday in a Texas jail cell from what authorities say was suicide by hanging.    But while officials say Sandra Bland committed suicide in her cell, an online campaign led by her friends and family is questioning that account.    The woman's family will hold a news conference in Chicago's Loop at noon. A news release from a law firm representing the family says, ""The family of Sandra Bland is confident that she was killed and did not commit suicide. The family has retained counsel to investigate Sandy's death.""    Bland was arrested Friday in Waller County, northwest of Houston, by a Texas state trooper and later charged with ""assault of a public servant,"" according to Waller County Sheriff Glenn Smith.    Bland's family could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said she was ""down from Illinois"" and about to start a new job in Texas.    Bland was arraigned after her Friday arrest and held in lieu of $5,000 bond, Smith said.    The county jail has two ""tanks"" for women, Smith said, and Bland had been placed alone in one of the tanks.    She was given breakfast about 7 a.m. Monday, he said, and she spoke to staff about an hour later about making a phone call.    A female jailer found her about 9 a.m., Smith said.    Paramedics were called and CPR was administered, he said, but she was pronounced dead shortly afterward.    The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston performed an autopsy on Bland on Tuesday, with the death ruled a suicide through hanging, according to Tricia Bentley, an institute spokeswoman.    Smith said there was no indication of any issues during Bland's stay at the jail.    He said Bland had come back down to Texas for a job.    ""Any time somebody dies, it's a tragic deal,"" Smith said. ""That's exactly what this appeared to be.""    Bland was pulled over about 4:30 p.m. Friday in Waller County for failing to signal a lane change, said Trooper Erik Burse, a spokesman for the Public Safety Department.    She was outside the car and about to be issued a written warning when she kicked the officer, Burse said, and was then taken into custody.    Posts featuring ""#JusticeForSandy"" and ""#WhatHappenedToSandyBland"" have gone up on Facebook and Twitter in recent days, questioning the official account of the woman's death."
E590,0,"Obama Reverses Decision, Orders Flags Be Flown at Half-Staff to Honor Chattanooga Victims","In an abrupt reversal, the White House decided Tuesday afternoon to order that flags be flown at half-staff to honor the four U.S. Marines and one sailor killed in the attacks at two Chattanooga military facilities last week.  Fox News reported the decision, which came hours after House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) called for the flags over the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff to honor the Chattanooga victims.  President Obama received criticism from many, including Navy SEAL veteran Marcus Luttrell, when the White House refused to order flags to be flown at half-staff Monday without reason.  Following a speech in Pittsburg at the Veterans of Foreign Wars’ national convention, Obama issued a proclamation for flags to be flown at half-staff from now until July 25 in honor of the five victims of the Chattanooga attacks, according to CBS Pittsburgh.  He labeled the move a ""mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence.""  On Tuesday morning, Boehner called the shootings at the Naval Marine Corps Reserve Center and nearby Army Recruiting Center in Chattanooga a ""terror attack,"" offering prayers for loved ones of the five service members shot and killed by alleged gunman Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.  Boehner also held a moment of silence for the victims with his colleagues on the House floor Tuesday.  Federal officials have launched a full-scale terrorism investigation into the attacks."

pheme_44,0,3 Dead After Police Storm Sydney Café to End Hostage Crisis,"Heavily armed police in Australia stormed a Sydney café where a gunman had held more than a dozen people hostage early Tuesday, ending a tense standoff that lasted more than 16 hours and saw at least three people die, including the gunman.  Police could be seen entering the café at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, after a gunman held at 17 people in the central business district of Australia’s largest city. Gunshots could be heard ringing out on video feeds from the scene, and local media reports indicated injuries were sustained by both hostages and police.  The gunman died in the police raid, authorities said, and he was identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born man and a self-described cleric who has been on authorities’ radar in the past. A chaotic scene unfolded as police raided the café, with hostages running outside and an officer carrying out at least one ailing hostage.  New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said the gunman had carried out “horrendous vicious attacks.”  “We are a peaceful society which is the envy of the world,” he said in a televised news conference. “Today we must come together like never before.”  Two hostages died, five escaped and six were uninjured, police said. At least one police officer suffered a minor gunshot wound to the face, but was alive. Police wouldn’t say whether the hostages were killed by the gunman or in crossfire during the raid, the Associated Press reports.  “They believed if they didn’t enter there would have been many more lives lost,” New South Wales Police commissioner Andrew Scipione said of the officers’ decision to raid the café. “Events that were unfolding inside of the premises led them to the belief that now was the time to deploy.”  It started Monday morning, when hostages were seen displaying a black-and-white flag in the window of the Lindt café in Martin Place — a major commercial precinct usually crowded with office workers and tourists and, at this time of year, Christmas shoppers.  The flag bore, in Arabic text, what was thought to be the shahada, or Muslim testimony of faith. The flag, which is commonly flown by Islamist terrorist groups, sparked fears that a terrorist attack was unfolding. But Sydney police had not said if it is a terrorist attack, and an official later described it as an “isolated incident.” Authorities confirmed earlier they had made contact with the perpetrator and were in negotiations. Several hostages had left the scene late Monday before the chaos that unfolded early Tuesday.  U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed overnight on the crisis.  “This is a very disturbing incident,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a televised address earlier Monday. “It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.  “We are a free, open and generous people, and today we have responded to this in character,” he added. “Yes, it has been a difficult day. Yes, it has been a day which has tested us, but so far, like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge.”  Australia’s paramount figure on Islamic law, the Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, issued a statement “unequivocally” condemning the action. He said the Muslim community was “devastated” by the incident and said such actions are “denounced in part and in whole in Islam.”  Buildings in the area, including the famed Sydney Opera House and the U.S. consulate, had been evacuated, with office workers taken to nearby Hyde Park. Martin Place train station, one of Sydney’s busiest, was closed, as were major nearby roads.  “Sometimes here in Australia you think something like this would never happen so it’s pretty shocking to see,” Kristina Ryan, who works nearby at Circular Quay, said Monday. “It’s been really frustrating with the lack of information and how much longer can they expect us to just sit here without understanding why this is happening? I think that’s really adding to the fear people are feeling in the city.”  Ryan said that fear was amplified as she and her co-workers watched as authorities evacuated the Opera House.  “There are lots of government buildings around. It’s a very busy place, especially on a Monday morning,” Clarke Jones, a terrorism expert at the Australian National University’s College of Asia and the Pacific, tells TIME.  The unfolding hostage crisis comes more than two months after Australian authorities foiled a terrorist plot by local supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), who were reportedly planning to behead members of the public in Martin Place.  Days later, on Sept. 21, forces affiliated with ISIS released a 42-minute audio recording calling on followers to attack non-Muslims in Australia. The call to arms appears to have been made in retaliation for Canberra’s deployment of military personnel and fighter jets to the Middle East to fight in the international coalition against ISIS and al-Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria and Iraq.  According to Jones, officials believe that up to 60 Australian nationals and residents are currently fighting in jihadist ranks in the Middle East. Dozens are believed to have already returned to Australia.  “They haven’t been prosecuted, but we don’t know at this stage if they’ve come back with an added intent to continue the fight here in Australia,” says Jones. “It’s hard to know.”  As darkness fell on Monday evening, a crowd of around 200 people remained milling around the scene. “Everyone was quite calm,” says Victor Domni, who works at Macquarie Bank directly across from the Lindt café and was among the first to be evacuated this morning. “I wasn’t in a position to do anymore work so I was ready to go home. I’m quite hesitant to go into work tomorrow because it’s quite scary.”  “We’ve seen this on the news happening in other places and it’s finally hit home so it’s a bit shocking,” he adds.  Abbott urged his fellow Australians to remain coolheaded.  “The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves. Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society,” he said on Monday morning. “Nothing should ever change that.”  — With reporting by Courtney Subramanian / Sydney  Read next: Australians Use #IllRideWithYou Hashtag in Solidarity With Muslims During Sydney Siege  Get The Brief.

pheme_324,0,Black Flag Is Hoisted as an Armed Person Takes Hostages in a Sydney Cafe,"Read here for updates to the Sydney hostage siege.  SYDNEY, Australia — Helicopters hovered over central Sydney, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott convened a meeting with his security advisers on Monday after an armed individual took hostages in a Sydney cafe and displayed a black flag with Arabic script in white in the window.  Police officers surrounded the cafe in the central business district where the hostages were pressed against the window holding the black flag, whose writing appeared to be the shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith. Andrew Scipione, the commissioner of the New South Wales police, said at a news briefing that an unknown number of hostages were being held in the cafe by a single armed person, but that three of the hostages had been released. “We don’t yet know the motivation of the perpetrator — we don’t know whether this is politically motivated — although obviously there are some indications that it could be,” Mr. Abbott said at a short briefing in Canberra, Australia’s capital. “There are people, even in a society such as ours, who would wish to do us harm.”  “The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,” he said. “Australia is a peaceful, open and generous society and nothing should ever change that, and that is why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual.”"
pheme_374,0,"Canada's parliament attacked, soldier fatally shot nearby","OTTAWA (Reuters) - A gunman attacked Canada’s parliament on Wednesday, with gunfire erupting near where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking, and a soldier was fatally shot at a nearby war memorial, stunning the Canadian capital.  The gunman in the parliament building was shot dead, and Harper was safely removed in incidents that may have been linked to Islamic militants.  Witness accounts indicated the man who shot dead the soldier guarding the National War Memorial in central Ottawa, went on to attack the parliament building minutes later. Canadian police said however they could not “at this point” confirm it was the same person.  The shootings followed an attack on two soldiers in Quebec on Monday carried out by a convert to Islam. Two U.S. officials said U.S. agencies had been advised the dead gunman in Wednesday’s shootings was also a Canadian convert to Islam.  Witnesses said a flurry of shots were fired after a gunman entered the parliament building, pursued by police.  The assault took place very near the room where Harper was meeting with members of his Conservative party, a government minister said.  “PM (Harper) was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,” Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement told Reuters.  The incident, shocking in Canada’s normally tranquil capital, began shortly before 10 a.m. ET and was not over late in the afternoon. Parliament and buildings in downtown remained on emergency lockdown at 6 p.m.  Canadian police were investigating a man named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as a possible suspect in the shootings, a source familiar with the matter said. U.S. government sources said the suspect was born Michael Joseph Hall but later changed his legal family name to Zehaf-Bibeau.  Security in Ottawa came under criticism after the gunman was able to run through the unlocked front door of the main parliament building. Police said an operation was under way to make parliament safe.  “It caught us by surprise... If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, (RCMP) told a news conference.  It was unclear whether there was any connection between Wednesday’s shootings and an attack on Monday when a convert to Islam ran down two Canadian soldiers with his car, killing one, near Montreal, before being shot dead by police in the first fatal attack on Canadian soil tied to Islamic militants.  No group, Islamic or otherwise, claimed responsibility for either the attack in Ottawa or the one near Montreal. Monday’s attacker, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau, who converted to Islam last year, was among 90 people being tracked by the RCMP on suspicion of taking part in militant activities abroad or planning to do so.  Canada announced this month it was joining the battle against Islamic State fighters who have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria.  GUNS DRAWN IN PARLIAMENT  From witness accounts it appeared the suspect dashed into parliament, ran past the room where Harper was speaking and was gunned down outside the entrance to the library, only about 60 feet (20 meters) away.  Dramatic video footage posted by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police with guns drawn inside the main parliament building. At least a dozen loud bangs can be heard on the clip, echoing through the hallway.  Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, a former policeman, told the Toronto Sun that parliament’s head of security, Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, shot dead a suspected gunman.  Canadian cabinet minister Jason Kenney said a guard in parliament buildings was also wounded in the incident.  Harper stressed that government and parliament should continue its work, a spokesman said. “While the prime minister stated that facts are still being gathered, he condemned this despicable attack,” the spokesman said.  Harper, who was meeting with cabinet ministers on Wednesday evening, was expected to make a statement later in the day.  Slideshow ( 24 images )  Canada said on Tuesday it had raised the national terrorism threat level to medium from low because of a rise in “general chatter” from radical groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda but said there had not been a specific threat.  The RCMP’s Michaud said the threat level on Parliament Hill had been on medium for some time.  The soldier who died in the shooting at the War Memorial was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, according to his aunt.  Cirillo was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton, and was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency, a federal agency responsible for border and immigration enforcement, his aunt told The Globe and Mail.  It was not clear if Cirillo was armed or not when he was shot.  Slideshow ( 24 images )  ‘YOU ARE IN DANGER HERE’  The attack on the heart of the country’s government shook Canada’s self-image as generally non-violent, particularly compared to the United States, where gun violence is much more common. Canadian cities and towns hiked security around government buildings, schools and mass transit systems.  As the drama in Ottawa unfolded, police in dark bulletproof vests and carrying automatic rifles flooded the streets near parliament, clearing several blocks of downtown Ottawa.  Some took cover behind vehicles and shouted to people to clear the area, saying: “We do not have the suspect in custody. You are in danger here.”  When the shooting started, most members of parliament were in the two caucus rooms past which the gunman ran. Members were told to lock or barricade themselves in their rooms or offices, and stay away from the windows.  A tweeted picture sent from the room where the opposition New Democrats were holding a weekly caucus showed a pile of chairs jammed up against the main door to prevent anyone from entering.  U.S. officials said there was no specific indication of a similar attack in the United States, a strong Canadian ally, but reinforced warnings to Americans to be alert.  “As a matter of precaution due to recent events, the FBI has reminded our field offices and government partners to remain vigilant in light of recent calls for attacks against government personnel by terrorist groups and like-minded individuals,” U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman Paul Bresson said.  Canadian and U.S. stock markets declined after the shootings in Ottawa. The Toronto Stock Exchange's TSX index .GSPTSE dropped 1.6 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX gave back 0.7 percent.  Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the United States, and the regulations at one point included a national registry of rifles and shotguns. Legislation was passed in 2012 to scrap the registry.  Ottawa also has a low murder rate. There were nine homicides in 2013 and seven in 2012, in a city of 885,000 people. Compared with Capitol Hill in Washington, security on Parliament Hill is also fairly low key. Anybody could walk right up to the front door of parliament’s Centre Block with arms and explosives without being challenged before entering the front door, where a few guards check accreditation.  Centre Block is the main building on Parliament Hill, a sprawling complex of buildings and open space in downtown Ottawa. It contains the House of Commons and Senate chambers as well as the offices of some members of parliament, senators, and senior administration for both legislative houses.  A construction worker who was on the scene in Ottawa when the shooting began told Reuters he heard a gunshot, and then saw a man with a scarf over his face running towards parliament.  “He was wearing blue pants and a black jacket and he had a double barreled shotgun and he ran up the side of this building here and hijacked a car at gunpoint,” construction worker Scott Walsh told Reuters.  The driver got out safely, then the man drove the car to the Centre Block, where construction work is under way, Walsh said.  The Canadian military closed its bases across the country to the public following the events in Ottawa, CBC TV said.  The attacks in Ottawa and Quebec took place as the Canadian government prepared to boost the powers of its spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney said last Thursday the new legislation would let the agency track and investigate potential terrorists when they travel abroad and ultimately prosecute them.  Outside Washington, unspecified extra security was authorized at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, where ceremonial guards mount a constant watch, a U.S. Defense Department official said."
politifact939,0,"For Education Secretary, Stimulus Means Dollars and Risk","“Teeny, teeny,” said Amy Wilkins, who as vice president at the Education Trust, a civil rights group, has studied the budgets of several of Mr. Duncan’s predecessors. “Margaret was looking for quarters in her pencil drawer.”  Mr. Duncan said he understood the unusual circumstances.  “There’s going to be this extraordinary influx of resources,” he said in an interview. “So people say, ‘You’re going to be the most powerful secretary ever,’ but I have no interest in that. Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.”  Mr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement  “islands of excellence,” he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.  The stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union.  Image Upon meeting department employees last month, Arne Duncan, the new education secretary, asked them to call him by his first name. My name is Arne, he said. Its not Mr. Secretary. Credit... Veronika Lukasova for The New York Times  The positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort.  “I want all of us to work hard enough and smart enough to take full advantage of this, because it’ll never happen again,” Mr. Duncan said last month in his first speech to hundreds of civil servants at department headquarters, as the outlines of the huge stimulus package were taking shape in Congress."
pheme_150,0,"Sydney siege: Hostage taker demands ISIS flag, warns of four bombs in city","SYDNEY (AFP) - A man holding hostages in a Sydney cafe on Monday has demanded that a flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group be delivered to him and warned that four bombs have been planted around the city, a report said.  New South Wales deputy police commissioner Catherine Burn told reporters she cannot confirm the demands reported by media outlets. ""We have to deal with him on the level of police negotiation. We cannot engage in speculation.""  A major square in the heart of the Australian city is in lockdown with hundreds of armed police surrounding the Lindt chocolate cafe, where a flag - black with white Arabic writing - was held to a window by customers.  It appears to be the shahada, or profession of faith in Islam, and says: ""There is no god but Allah; Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah."" Channel Ten said it had spoken to two of the hostages inside the cafe and the man holding them had made a series of demands.  ""Our #TenNews team have spoken directly to 2 hostages inside the café... They are confirming 2 demands from the perpetrator,"" the network tweeted.  ""He needs the ISIL flag to be directly delivered to the cafe; And his 2nd request is to speak to the Prime Minster.  ""They also state there are 4 bombs... two inside the Lindt café at Martin Place - and two further in the Sydney CBD.""  There was no confirmation from police. ISIL is an alternative name for ISIS.  Five people have so far fled the cafe, three men some six hours into the siege and two women about an hour later.  Australia has been on high alert after the government raised concerns that citizens who have fought alongside jihadists in Iraq and Syria could return home radicalised and capable of carrying out attacks.  The government in September raised its terror threat level and police conducted large-scale counter-terror raids across the country."
pheme_55,0,Five people flee from Sydney cafe amid hostage drama,"Story highlights At least five people have fled the cafe, Seven Network video shows  Police negotiators are in contact with a hostage taker, the official says  Australia's PM says it's unclear whether the violence is politically motivated  Local media carry images of people holding a black flag with Arabic writing  Five people have fled from a cafe in the heart of Sydney where a dramatic hostage taking is unfolding Monday.  But an unknown number of people remain in the cafe, held by at least one armed hostage taker.  Hundreds of police officers have shut down a usually bustling area in Australia's most populous city amid the crisis.  Chilling images from local media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the glass of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district.  Footage showed them holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it that reads: ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God.""  Three people who were seen running out of the cafe ""are now out of the building and they are now with police,"" said New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn, declining to give details about whether they escaped or were let go.  Video from CNN affiliate Seven Network later showed two more people running out of the cafe.  Authorities said many of the details about the situation remained unclear, including the number of people inside the cafe and the motivations of the hostage taker.  ""We don't know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters.

Australia, which is part of the international coalition fighting the terrorist group ISIS in the Middle East, said in September that it had foiled a plot by Islamic militants to carry out a public execution.  New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said it wasn't yet clear whether the situation at the cafe was a terrorist event but that police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert.""  Burn said police negotiators are now in contact with a hostage taker, who appears to have taken staff and customers captive as people were heading to work on Monday morning in the Martin Place area.  Chris Kenny, an editor at The Australian newspaper, said he was at the cafe Monday morning. He left shortly before the siege started.  ""As police quickly swarmed and cleared the area, I turned to see a man against the window, facing out with his hands raised,"" he wrote in his account of the incident. ""At first I was relieved thinking this was the gunman responding to police -- but soon the awful realisation the customers were being forced against the windows.""  Seven Network reported that at least 13 people are being held at the cafe, but Scipione declined to say how many were in there.  Police barricaded off streets and evacuated buildings near the cafe, bringing an eerie quiet to a district typically buzzing with pedestrians and vehicles.  MAP: Sydney CBD  The Martin Place train station was shut down, according to police. They urged people to stay away from the area, but some local office workers gathered at the scene to try to find out what was going on.  The buildings evacuated included the U.S. Consulate General, said Alicia Edwards, a spokeswoman. All personnel have been accounted for, although it's not known whether there are any U.S. citizens among the hostages. U.S. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation."
pheme_35,0,Paris: 12 dead in attack on satirical paper that poked fun at Mohammed,"Twelve people were killed in a shooting Wednesday after masked gunmen shouting ""Allahu akbar!"" stormed into the Paris offices of a Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper which had been firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons in 2011 joking about Muslim religious leaders.  Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter    Reports said two of the dead were police officers, and that there 20 people wounded, at least four seriously; the dead include the editor and the cartoonist of the paper. It was France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades.  Satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo (Charlie Weekly) has on several occasions depicted Islam's prophet in an effort to defend free speech and defy the anger of Muslims who believe depicting Mohammad is sacrilegious.  Video: Reuters (צילום: רויטרס)  X  ""This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,"" President Francois Hollande told reporters after rushing to the scene of the attack. His government raised France's security level to the highest notch and scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting.  The gunmen fled towards the eastern Paris suburbs after holding up a car, police officials said.  The moments of the shooting  X  ""There is possibility of other attacks and other sites are being secured,"" Police union official Rocco Contento said, telling reporters that three attackers got into a getaway car driven by a fourth man upon fleeing the building and drove to Port de Pantin in north-east Paris, where they abandoned the first car and hijacked a second – throwing the driver out into the road.  Meanwhile, France raised its terror alert to the highest level. Le Monde newspaper reported that Parisian newsrooms, including their own, were placed under police protection after the attack.  GRAPHIC VIDEO: The gunmen escaping and shooting a police officer (צילום: youtube)  X  ""About a half an hour ago two black-hooded men entered the building with Kalashnikovs (guns),"" Benoit Bringer told the station. ""A few minutes later we heard lots of shots,"" he said, adding that the men were then seen fleeing the building.  ""It's carnage,"" a police official, Luc Poignant, told BFM TV.  Photo: AFP  French media are reporting that cartoonist “Charb”, whose real name is Stephane Charbonnier and who was chief editor of Charlie Hebdo, was among those killed in the attack.  Earlier this week, the magazine published a cartoon mocking the Islamic State by showing a jihadist beheading the Prophet.  Cartoon published earlier this week  ""The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement on his official Twitter feed.  ""All the White House is in solidarity with the families of those who were killed or injured in the attack,"" said Josh Earnest, spokesman for US President Barack Obama on MSNBC.  France last year reinforced its anti-terrorism laws and is already on alert after calls from Islamist militants to attack its citizens and interests in reprisal for French military strikes on Islamist strongholds in the Middle East and Africa.  Photo: AFP  The attack, as yet unclaimed, comes amid what a number of commentators have identified as rising xenophobia in Europe, with thousands of protesters in several German cities rallying earlier this week against Muslim immigration. France's five-million-strong Muslim population is Europe's largest.  ""I am extremely angry. These are criminals, barbarians. They have sold their soul to hell. This is not freedom. This is not Islam and I hope the french will come out united at the end of this,"" said Hassen Chalghoumi, imam of the Drancy mosque in Paris's Seine-Saint-Denis northern suburb.  In 2012, two men were arrested in France on suspicion of plotting to behead the editor of the satirical journal. The threat came after a September issue included a front cover that depicted an Orthodox Jew pushing a turban-wearing figure in a wheelchair and also had several caricatures of the Prophet throughout the pages of the issue, including some of him naked.      The September 2012 cover  In 2011 Charlie Hebdo's offices were hit by a firebomb and its website was pirated after publishing an edition titled ""Charia Hebdo"" featuring several Mohammed cartoons.  The newspaper is headquarted in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, in the east of the capital."

pheme_208,0,"'Canada will never be intimidated,' Harper says after shootings in Ottawa","Two “despicable attacks” on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country’s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.  Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.  The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.  Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.  “This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.  “We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.  “But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”  Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”  National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”  The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.  Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""  But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”  RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.  Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.  Panic on the Hill  The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.  When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.  A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.  Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.  Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.  Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.  Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.  Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.  ""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.  ""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""  Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.  Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.  “This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.  He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.  “If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.  The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.  Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.  “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”  The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.  On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.  Security beefed up  The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.  Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.  U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.  Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.  The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”  “We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.  A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”  With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press  An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

E665,0,Black Churches Are Burning Again in America,"Two other predominantly black churches have been the target of possible arson in the past fornight: Glover Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Warrenville, South Carolina, which caught fire on Friday, and College Hill Seventh Day Adventist, which burned on Monday in Knoxville, Tennessee. Investigators in Knoxville told a local news station they believed it was an act of vandalism, although they aren’t investigating the incident as a hate crime. (There have also been at least four other cases of fires at churches in the past fortnight. At Fruitland Presbyterian Church in Gibson County, Tennessee, and the Greater Miracle Temple Apostolic Holiness Church in Tallahassee, Florida, officials suspect the blazes were caused by lightning and electrical wires, respectively, but investigations are still ongoing. A church that is not predominantly black—College Heights Baptist Church in Elyria, Ohio—was burned on Saturday morning. The fire appears to have been started in the sanctuary, and WKYC reports that the cause is still under investigation. The town’s fire and police departments did not immediately return calls for confirmation on Sunday.* And a Monday, June 29, fire at Disciples of Christ Ministries in Jackson, Mississippi, was ruled accidental.)  These fires join the murder of nine people at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church as major acts of violence perpetrated against predominantly black churches in the last fortnight. Churches are burning again in the United States, and the symbolism of that is powerful. Even though many instances of arson have happened at white churches, the crime is often association with racial violence: a highly visible attack on a core institution of the black community, often done at night, and often motivated by hate.  As my colleague David Graham noted last week, the history of American church burnings dates to before the Civil War, but there was a major uptick in incidents of arson at black churches in the middle and late 20th century. One of the most famous was the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four girls. Three decades later, cases of church arson rose sharply. In response, in 1995, President Bill Clinton also set up a church-arson investigative task force, and in 1996, Congress passed a law increasing the sentences for arsonists who target religious organizations, particularly for reasons of race or ethnicity. Between 1995 and 1999, Clinton’s task force reported that it opened 827 investigations into burnings and bombings at houses of worship; it was later disbanded.  In recent years, it’s been harder to get a clear sense of the number of church fires across the country. The National Fire Protection Association reports that between 2007 and 2011, there were an average of 280 intentionally set fires at houses of worship in America each year, although a small percentage of those took place at other religious organizations, like funeral homes. One of the organization’s staffers, Marty Ahrens, said that tracking church arson has become much more complicated since reporting standards changed in the late ‘90s. Sometimes, fires that are reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System are considered “suspicious,” but they can’t be reported as arson until they’re definitively ruled “intentional.” Even then, it’s difficult to determine what motivated an act of arson. “To know that something is motivated by hate, you either have to know who did it or they have to leave you a message in some way that makes it very obvious,” she said. “There are an awful lot of [intentionally set fires] that are not hate crimes—they’re run-of-the-mill kids doing stupid things.”"
E458,0,American Airlines to drop Phila.-Tel Aviv service,"American Airlines will discontinue flights between Philadelphia and Tel Aviv, Israel, in January because the route was losing money with intense competition from the New York-area airports.  American will close its station in Tel Aviv. The airline does not fly to Israel from another city.  ""At the six-year mark, we have yet to turn a profit on this route,"" said Rhett Workman, American's managing director of government and airport affairs.  ""We really tried to make a go of it. We were hoping that with the merger"" of US Airways and American in December 2013, ""and, more recently, with the significant reduction in fuel prices, the route would turn to the black. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.""  The Nutter administration called on Philadelphia's largest airline, with 76 percent of the market, to reevaluate the decision, saying it was ""very disappointed."" The mayor has made two economic development trips to Israel in recent years.  ""In the future, this business decision may be viewed as shortsighted as more Israeli businesses express interest in Philadelphia,"" the administration said. ""Indeed, we're now seeing a trend where Israeli firms have decided to locate their operations in Philadelphia.""  Halting the flights ""sends the wrong message about our city and region as an open and business friendly locale and damages American Airlines' reputation as an international business,"" the mayor's office said.  Workman said: ""We've kept the route in the market longer than we have other routes, even though it was underperforming, because of all the significant business and community links associated with it.  ""It's a very tough decision,"" Workman said. ""We have 19 employees on the ground in Tel Aviv. We have colleagues and friends on that side, and a lot of strong partnerships with the Tel Aviv and Israel community.""  More than 70 percent of the passengers on the Tel Aviv flights were connecting from elsewhere, Workman said. American could not raise the fares enough to cover its costs because those customers would connect through another city.  Richard Bendit, president of the Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, said the nonstop daily flight between Philadelphia and Israel in July 2009 was ""heralded as a 'game-changing' move, expected to boost both commerce and tourism between Israel and the Greater Philadelphia region.""  Since 2009, the Philadelphia area has ""become a gateway for U.S.-Israeli trade,"" with about 25 percent, or an estimated $5 billion, ""of all Israeli exports to the U.S. passing through our region,"" Bendit said.  Passengers on the inaugural flight to Tel Aviv on July 2, 2009 said they were appreciative to have another option for flying directly to Israel, and said the fares were cheaper than those from other cities.  Previously, Philadelphians bound for Israel flew out of Newark or New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Israel's El Al Airlines had dominated the market, although Delta Air Lines and United Airlines fly to Tel Aviv from the New York area.  ""We looked at every single option with every single aircraft that we have,"" Workman said. ""The reason we've had the route in place for six years is because of the tremendous support we've had from the city,"" including political leaders and the business community.  The 5,700-mile flight is about 12 hours to Israel and 13 hours back, and was the longest in the US Airways' network and its first to the Middle East.  The route required two aircraft. US Airways used Airbus A330-200 planes with 258 seats. ""The flights were full for the most part,"" Workman said.  ""But that's not an indicator of profitability. It depends on what yield you are getting from your customers,"" he said. ""Any airline can fill any flight full if you drop your price low enough. We were not getting the revenue from the passenger side of the aircraft that we needed to make this flight profitable.""  215-854-2831@LoydLinda"
pheme_18,0,Scene in Sydney: Grenades and gunfire,"Story highlights Explosions and gunfire heard as police storm Sydney cafe, ending siege  Police move in after more hostages escape  High-profile attack in Sydney's central business district unprecedented  Streets usually bustling with city workers, tourists and shoppers  Dramatic scenes ended a tense hostage situation early Tuesday in Sydney, with sounds of an explosion and gunfire as Australian police stormed a cafe where a gunman had hours earlier taken more than 10 people hostage.  ""The whole moment seemed to begin by the escape by our count of six or seven hostages; they ran out from the right-hand side of the cafe and flew down the steps and into the arms of the waiting police,"" Channel 7 reporter Chris Reason told CNN.  ""At that point there were a couple of minutes of silence, a police unit moved in; we could see them in dark uniforms, night-vision goggles on, looking toward the door. There was a shot fired -- we think that at that point that it was the gunman firing a shot. We heard from one police officer saying that a hostage was down and at that point the police moved in,"" Reason said.  ""We saw a lot of explosive material -- flash bangs as they're called, stun grenades to try to disrupt and startle the gunman as police units moved in from both sides of the cafe to try to get him before he could do any further damage.""  Live footage from the scene later showed heavily armed police running toward the Lindt Chocolate Cafe before at least four people were carried away on stretchers.  Channel 7 reporter Sean Berry said the scene had been quiet for several hours before police swarmed the area.

On any ordinary workday, the scene in Sydney would have been packed with people crisscrossing Martin Place on their way to work, home and shops.  But this week before Christmas, the inner-city streets fell silent.  ""It is eerily quiet for the center of the city, which is normally humming with traffic and pedestrians. ... People would be normally walking the streets. They've roped off several blocks around Martin Place,"" said CNN's Anna Coren, who was about a block from the scene.  Martin Place is a paved traffic-free zone, a pedestrian-friendly promenade a few blocks from the ferry terminal at Sydney Harbor. It's where people go to meet, have coffee and catch a train.  Heavily armed police  Outside the Lindt shop, heavily armed police, some in camouflage gear and armed with sniper rifles, had taken positions as negotiators attempted to talk to the man inside, since identified as Man Haron Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, a self-styled Muslim cleric.  Passers-by were herded back behind police barriers, while surrounding buildings were evacuated.  Opposite the Lindt shop is the entrance to the Martin Place underground train station, where trains stopped running during the siege.  Beyond the train station are the studios of Australian network Channel 7, whose huge glass windows act as the backdrop for early-morning programming, and where crowds are encouraged to gather.  In the early hours of the standoff, the network, a CNN affiliate, turned its cameras around to film across the street. It captured the images that Channel 7 producer Patrick Byrne described as ""shocking and chilling.""  ""People were putting their hands up against the panes of glass at the cafe. This was just extraordinary,"" Byrne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  Moments later a black flag bearing white Islamic writing was pressed against the window, drawing gasps from the newsroom, he said.

'Surreal' scene  Few live images of the cafe were broadcast amid police warnings not to disclose operational matters.  Macquarie Radio Network reporter Glenn Wheeler described the scene as ""very surreal.""  ""There are literally hundreds or thousands of people wandering around with this expression of bewilderment,"" he told 2GB radio station. ""We can't believe this is happening.""  He said hundreds, if not thousands, of people had assembled in nearby Hyde Park after being told to leave the area around Martin Place.  Wheeler recounted a conversation he had with two German tourists who said, ""We thought Sydney was safe.""  It was a sentiment that was apparent in the street and on social media.  While Australia's operating under a ""high"" terror alert, a high-profile attack in Sydney's central business district was unexpected and unprecedented.  Authorities are not explicitly referring to the incident as a ""terror attack,"" but New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert.""  Sydney residents expressed their shock and dismay.  ""It's probably the first time in Australian history that something this major in regards to a terrorist threat has happened,"" Joshua Martin told Reuters.  'High' terror alert  The hostage situation follows dozens of police terror raids in the city that have strained relations with the local Muslim community.  Amid reports that as many as 100 Australians had left the country to support ISIS' quest to create a so-called Islamic State, authorities introduced tough new terror laws.  The new regulations give authorities the power to imprison people for ""advocating terrorism."" They also criminalize travel to areas deemed by Australia's foreign minister as ""no-go"" zones, and impose stiff penalties for Australian citizens who leave the country to engage in foreign wars.  In September, Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised the country's terror threat level to ""high"" but said there had been ""no specific intelligence of particular plots."""
pheme_267,0,Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton identified as soldier gunned down in Ottawa attack,"OTTAWA — The Canadian soldier who was shot and killed as he stood guard on a bright and chilly morning at the National War Memorial is identified as Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, family and military sources say.  A Parliament Hill security guard was wounded in the chaotic attack Wednesday just before 10 a.m. in the nation’s capital that police believe involved more than one assailant.  Cirillo, of Hamilton, was one of two Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada reservists standing guard in front of the monument when a gunman opened fire Wednesday morning. The shooter was killed inside the Parliament buildings after firing at least 20 shots.  Ottawa police would not confirm a CBS News report that has identified the dead shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. A high-ranking federal officer confirmed his identity to The Canadian Press. He was born in 1982 and is believed to be Canadian, the American news outlet reported, quoting U.S. officials.  Court and property records show a man named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau had a last known address in Montreal and a 2004 arrest for possession of marijuana and phencyclidine, also known as PCP or angel dust.  After the CBS report, pictures of a man named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian, began to circulate, including one depicting a man by that name with long, dark hair, wearing a scarf around the lower half of his face and holding a primitive-looking long rifle.  Police cars at the scene of a shooting on Parliament Hill.              One of those photos was posted on an ISIS media outlet on Twitter and shows the same image.  Social media accounts and online photos paint a picture of Cirillo as a loving father to his young son, animal lover and fitness buff. Pictures depict him smiling, cuddling a dog, working out at the gym, and playing guitar.  Cirillo was part of a large family and attended Sherwood Secondary School.  Alleged locations of shooting in Ottawa  Messages of condolences and grief were posted online, including on the Argylls’ Facebook page, where a photo of Cirillo and another soldier proudly guarding the monument was posted Oct. 19.  Col. Geordie Elms, the Hamilton mayor’s senior adviser of military heritage and protocol and a former commanding officer of the Argylls, said they are a close-knit group, shocked by the death.  “This kind of duty is something they look forward to; it’s a treat,” he said.  The shootings occurred at the National War Memorial and Parliament Hill. Contrary to early reports, no shooting occurred near the Rideau Centre mall, Ottawa police said.  In the area around Parliament, the lockdown that had been lifted earlier in the day was reinstated Wednesday evening, parliamentary security officials said, explaining the situation was still fluid.  Witnesses described seeing the soldier, who was serving as a ceremonial guard at the foot of the cenotaph, shot at point-blank range before the gunman ran off in the direction of Parliament Hill.  Sirens blared and buildings in the area went under lockdown as police and soldiers continued the manhunt into Wednesday afternoon.  Police said in a news release Wednesday afternoon that nobody had been arrested. Police were then going on the assumption there was more than one shooter.  The Ottawa Hospital said it has received three patients, two of whom are listed in stable condition.  Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove films shooting in Parliament Hill building  An Ottawa woman driving beside the War Memorial noticed a beige car parked in a lane near the monument where no car would normally be parked.  As she watched, a short man with shoulder-length hair and an open jacket got out of the car on the driver’s side.  “As I’m wondering what the heck is this, the driver opens the back door to his car and pulls out what looks to be a bunch of blankets or a rolled-up sleeping bag, and he runs, dashes, to the War Memorial,” she told the Star.  A few moments later, she saw the man coming back. “And I see that he’s carrying a shiny object that, from afar, looked like a pipe, like a silvery-coloured pipe, which I now know was a long gun,” she recalled.  She asked not to be identified.  Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said in an interview with the Star he was in his office when he was advised by Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau what was unfolding.  “First thing that went through my mind was this more than one person or is it more than one. Obviously as the moments went on it appeared it was more than one person. It was a very frightening situation because there are thousands if people in the downtown.”  He said an emergency response plan kicked into gear.  Police cars and emergency vehicles were clustered at the foot of the Peace Tower and the Centre Block was evacuated. RCMP warned that anyone in downtown Ottawa should stay away from windows and roofs.  Police set up an ever-expanding cordon around the Hill, shutting down streets and pushing pedestrians and journalists further back as additional police vehicles and officers flooded into the scene. A police command post was set on Metcalfe St. across from Parliament Hill.  Tens of thousands of public servants in buildings around Ottawa and across the river in Gatineau, Que., were told to stay where they are.  Witness Alain Merizier said one suspect was carrying a hunting rifle. The suspect had dark hair, was wearing civilian clothes and driving a black car, Merizier said.  Reporters and parliamentary staff reported dozens of shots in the hallways. It was caucus day for the federal parties, so members of Parliament and senators were locked down in the hallways near the Commons.  Spokespeople for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said all were safe and in secure locations.  Joshua Johnston, co-owner of Atwill-Morin, a stone masonry company, was being hailed as a hero after he shepherded as many as 25 Parliament Hill workers to safety.  “One woman froze, some were infirm and didn’t move very quickly, but ultimately they listened and it went smoothly,” Johnston said.  One woman opened a window and punched out a screen and was prepared to jump nine metres before Johnston and co-workers built a rudimentary scaffold and carried her to safety.  With as many as six police sharpshooters massed outside, they clambered to safety and took shelter behind rocks.  “We didn’t know where (the shooter) was or how many there were there,” he said.  “But it sounded like he was just down the hall.”  Toronto Liberal MP John McKay had arrived for morning caucus in Centre Block when he heard shots. Security staff evacuated the group to the rear of the building where they took shelter behind a monument.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  There he met an employee from the Library of Parliament who related how she a gunman outside the library in Centre Block. She said he was wearing a hoodie and had what appeared to be a gun.  He was in the corridor containing the meeting rooms where Harper was meeting with his caucus on one side and the NDP meeting on the other.  New Democrat MP Charlie Angus said he and his colleagues heard several rounds of heavy gunfire he said sounded as if it was coming from right outside the door.  Angus said MPs and staffers tried to barricade the door with tables and lay down on the floor as they heard what he said was at least two rounds of gunshots followed by another few shots.  “People put up furniture. We put tables against the door. We lay down. You’ve never been through this before. You don’t know what the routine is other than what you have seen in the movies, so we didn’t know if someone was going to be able to try and get in,” Angus said.  “We were on the floor and then security came and they were very, very, very serious,” Angus said by telephone from his office on Sparks St., after having evacuated the building.  “They told us to run, to stay down and to stay along the walls,” Angus said.  NDP MP Craig Scott also described hearing two bursts of rapid-fire shots just outside the caucus room.  “It sounded like it was literally on the other side of the wall where I was sitting at the back of the room,” Scott said Wednesday.  “I grabbed a table to barricade one of the three doors leading into our room and a colleague (NDP MP Hoang Mai) and I stood to either side of the door, so as not to be shot through the door to reinforce the table if it got pushed from the outside,” Scott said, adding that NDP MP Nathan Cullen was doing the same at another door.  He said other MPs were hiding under tables.  Conservative MP Maurice Vellacott says his staff was told by Commons security there were as many as three gunmen.  Vellacott was escorting a group of parents and children through security one floor below main entrance when he heard a gunshot.  Security staff quickly hustled the group out of the building through a tunnel to East Block. He said several of the group remain under lockdown in East Block.  A shaken Marc-Andre Viau, spokesperson for the NDP, saw the suspect run into the main doors of Centre Block, chased by a Mountie. Soon after he heard a volley of shots from inside the building.  “As soon as the police officer walked in, there were a lot of shots, multiple shots fired. There was a pause then I heard another round of shots,” Viau said.  He was just outside the building at the time and a police officer had just told people to take cover. That’s when he saw the suspect run by.  The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over — and one of them killed — in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.  The incident on Parliament Hill was an unprecedented breach of security, according to eyewitnesses.  The White House said Wednesday afternoon that President Barack Obama had spoken to Harper by telephone “to express the American people’s solidarity with Canada” following the attacks on Canadian soldiers both Wednesday in Ottawa on Monday in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que.  “President Obama condemned these outrageous attacks, and reaffirmed the close friendship and alliance between our people. The president offered any assistance Canada needed in responding to these attacks. Prime Minister Harper thanked the president and the two leaders discussed the assault and agreed to continue coordination between our governments moving forward,” the White House said in a statement.  Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said they have increased patrols around Parliament House and at the Canadian High Commission.  Gov. General David Johnston said he and his wife, Sharon, were “shocked and deeply saddened” to learn of the attacks.  “At this most difficult time, we wish to express our deepest sympathies to the family of the Canadian Armed Forces member who was killed in this crisis. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to those who were injured today,” Johnston said in the statement issued Wednesday.  “As governor general and commander-in-chief of Canada, I am grateful for the professionalism and courage of our security personnel and emergency responders,” he said.

E666,0,"Philae comet could be home to alien life, say scientists","  The comet landed on by the spacecraft Philae could well be home to an abundance of alien microbial life, according to leading astronomers.  Features of the comet, named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, such as its organic-rich black crust, are most likely explained by the presence of living organisms beneath an icy surface, the scientists have said.    Rosetta, the European spacecraft orbiting the comet, is also said to have picked up strange clusters of organic material that resemble viral particles.  A photo illustration of the Rosetta probe and Philae lander above the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet, during November’s historic landing. Photograph: ESA/ESA via Getty Images  The European Space Agency pulled off a sensational feat of engineering and captured the imagination of space-travel enthusiasts across the world when Philae landed on the comet in November. Since then, the lander has undergone a period of hibernation from which it awoke in June, having recharged its solar panels.  Neither Rosetta nor Philae are equipped to search for direct evidence of life after a proposal to include this in the mission was allegedly laughed out of court. Maverick astronomer and astrobiologist Prof Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was involved in the mission planning 15 years ago, believes people should be more open to the possibility of alien life.  Wickramasinghe said: “Five hundred years ago it was a struggle to have people accept that the Earth was not the centre of the universe. After that revolution our thinking has remained Earth-centred in relation to life and biology. It’s deeply ingrained in our scientific culture and it will take a lot of evidence to kick it over.”  Prof Wickramasinghe’s views are regarded as several steps outside the scientific mainstream. He has previously suggested that the SARS virus arrived to Earth from space and that airborne spores that caused rainfall in Kerala to turn a reddish hue had an extraterrestrial origin.  He and colleague Dr Max Wallis, from the University of Cardiff, believe 67P and other comets like it could provide homes for living microbes similar to the “extremophiles” that inhabit the most inhospitable regions of the Earth.  Comets may have helped to sow the seeds of life on Earth and possibly other planets such as Mars, they argue.  The scientists have carried out computer simulations that suggest microbes could inhabit watery regions of the comet. Organisms containing anti-freeze salts could be active at temperatures as low as -40C, their research shows.    The comet has a black hydrocarbon crust overlaying ice, smooth icy “seas” and flat-bottomed craters containing lakes of re-frozen water overlain with organic debris.  Wickramasinghe said data coming from the comet seems to point to “micro-organisms being involved in the formation of the icy structures, the preponderance of aromatic hydrocarbons, and the very dark surface”.    “These are not easily explained in terms of prebiotic chemistry. The dark material is being constantly replenished as it is boiled off by heat from the sun. Something must be doing that at a fairly prolific rate.”  The astronomers present their case for life on 67P at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno, Wales."
pheme_314,0,,"William M. Welch  USA TODAY  Five people escaped from a cafe in downtown Sydney where at least one armed person held an undisclosed number of hostages, Monday.  New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn confirmed to the Associated Press that three people ""emerged from the location"" more than six hours after the hostage crisis began.  About an hour later, two women wearing aprons with the Lindt chocolate logo fled the Lindt Chocolat Cafe into the arms of heavily armed police officers.  ""The first thing that we are doing is making sure that they are OK. We will then establish who they are and then we will continue to work with them,"" Burn said.  Burn said police had made contact with the gunman. Police have asked that media outlets do not report the gunman's demands, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  A flag with Arabic script was displayed through the cafe window and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the events may be ""politically motivated.''  The standoff gripped downtown Sydney, shutting down government offices, public transit and schools as it dragged through the day.  The normally busy and crowded business district of the city was on virtual lockdown, with hundreds of officers on the scene.  New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said at an afternoon news conference that ""an undisclosed number of hostages'' were being held by ""an armed offender.'' Some media reports said 13 people were being held hostage, but there were conflicting reports of larger numbers.  ""We have moved to a footing of a terrorism event,'' Scipione said.  Television and still images from the scene showed several people inside the cafe holding their hands up in the air, pressed against windows, with a visible black flag bearing what appeared to be Arabic script.  ""It's a flag that we've had people looking at. We're still trying to work out what it stands for,'' the police commissioner said.  ""We do not know the motivation of the perpetrator,'' Abbott said in a televised address. He called it ""very disturbing.''  ""We don't know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,"" he said in the nation's capital, Canberra. ""We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, there are people who would wish to do us harm.""  St. Vincent's hospital spokesman David Faktor said a male hostage was in the hospital's emergency department. He was the only one of the freed hostages to be taken to a hospital.  ""He's in a satisfactory condition, so he's sitting up and that's all we can give out. We can't talk about the reason for his presentation,"" Faktor said.  Abbott earlier said in a statement that local and federal police were responding to the ""reported hostage-taking incident in Martin Place in Sydney.'' He called it ""obviously a deeply concerning incident'' and said the national security committee of his cabinet was meeting on the situation at the cafe in Martin's Place in the city's central business district.  The U.S. Embassy in Australia's capital, Canberra, confirmed a ""security incident involving at least one armed person at the Lindt Chocolate Café in Martin Place.''  The embassy in a notice posted on its Facebook page urged U.S. citizens to avoid the area and ""maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.""  The Daily Telegraph newspaper of Sydney and Sky News reported it was believed there were 13 hostages being held in the cafe. Sky News reported there was at least one armed man holding the hostage and perhaps more.  The Daily Telegraph quoted the CEO of the company that owns the Lindt Cafe as saying there could be as many as 40 people being held.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe said ""we are deeply concerned over this serious incident"" in post on the cafe's Facebook page and offered thoughts and prayers for the hostages and their loved ones.  The Sydney Opera House was evacuated. The New South Wales parliament was shut down to the public, the Daily Telegraph reported. Streets in the area of the cafe were closed, as was a major expressway into the city, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Public transportation was shut down, and courts in the area were locked down. Motorists were urged to avoid the downtown area.  The Daily Telegraph reported that the hostages were being forced to pace inside the cafe, and that there were reports the gunman had asked to speak to the prime minister.  Zain Ali, the head of the Islamic Studies Research Unit at the University of Auckland, told the Associated Press that it was difficult to read the message on the flag but he believed it was the Shahada, or declaration of faith. Ali said the Shahada translates as ""There is no deity of worship except God (Allah), and Muhammad is the messenger of God."" It is considered the first pillar of Islam's five pillars of faith, and has been used by groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State but wasn't invented by them, Ali said.    A police spokeswoman said no injuries had been reported.  Contributing: Associated Press"
E696,0,Facebook Rainbow Profile Photos: The Latest Big Data Experiment?,"“It's not an experiment or test,” Nevius told me of the rainbow feature. “Everyone sees the same thing.”  But all this raises a serious question: Is Facebook doing research with its “Celebrate Pride” feature? Facebook's data scientists have attracted public scrutiny for conducting experiments on its users: tracking their moods and voting behavior. Much less attention has been given to their ongoing work to better understand collective action and social change online.  In March, the company published a paper that got little outside attention at the time, research that reveals some of the questions Facebook might be asking now. In “The Diffusion of Support in an Online Social Movement,” Bogdan State, a Stanford Ph.D. candidate, and Lada Adamic, a data scientist at Facebook, analyzed the factors that predicted support for marriage equality on Facebook back in March 2013. They looked at what factors contributed to a person changing their profile photo to the red equals sign, but the implication of their research is much larger: At stake is our understanding of whether groups of citizens can organize online—and how that collective activity affects larger social movements.  Scholars and activists have debated the effectiveness of profile-image campaigns since at least 2009, when Twitter users turned their profiles green, joined Facebook groups, and changed their location setting to Tehran in support of Iranian protesters. Experts downplayed the importance of such actions; Global Voices Iran editor Fred Petrossian argued that talk of a Twitter revolution ""reveals more about Western fantasies for new media than the reality in Iran."" Evgeny Morozov, who was a Yahoo fellow at the time, called it “slacktivism,” a “harmless activism” that “wasn't very productive.”  Among other critiques, Morozov voiced two important questions in a larger debate over the value of collective action online. First, he argued that social-media solidarity has an unknown effect toward political change, perhaps even siphoning energy away from more effective action. Secondly, Morozov downplayed the cost and risk of that participation. But unlike Westerners showing solidarity for Iranians on Twitter, gender equality in the U.S. involves changes in social relations alongside political changes. Changing one’s profile image in support of marriage equality in America carries immediate risks and costs, from “a quarrel with one’s otherwise-thinking friends—to the life-threatening,” as State and Adamic explain in their research.  Indeed, it's hard to look at the compilation of coming-out videos posted by YouTube on Friday and dismiss online activity as inconsequential. The “slacktivism” of changing a profile image matters in part because of the personal risks it may entail, and in part because it may contribute to changes in the social acceptance of LGBTQ people. While some might argue a rainbow-colored profile is a lazy way of showing support, it could be an act of great courage for the person changing their profile.  What leads people to participate in costly, risky social change, anyway? And might people be more likely to get involved if their friends also participate? That's the question asked by Stanford sociologist Doug McAdam in his research on Freedom Summer, a 1964 civil-rights action that placed over 700 college students in black families’ homes in Mississippi to register black voters. Over 10 weeks, there were three murders, “52 serious beatings, 250 arrests, and 13 black churches burned to the ground.” When McAdam found an archive of 1,086 Freedom Summer volunteer application forms, including lists of volunteers' most trusted friends, he had a unique opportunity to test the factors associated with costly, risky social change.  In a statistical model, McAdam found that the greatest predictors of involvement in Freedom Summer were “(a) greater number of organizational affiliations, (b) higher levels of prior civil rights activity, and (c) stronger and more extensive ties to other participants.” In other words, among those who applied and were accepted, people with more participating friends were more likely to go through with their activism, when controlling for other factors. And when Facebook’s researchers studied how support for marriage equality spread on their social network, they cited McAdam’s research and Freedom Summer as an important inspiration.  Although McAdam later studied network structure, The Freedom Summer data couldn’t answer the question of whether seeing others take action prompts a person to get involved. But in March 2013, when millions of Facebook users changed their profile, Facebook’s researchers saw it as a chance to evaluate how participation spreads.  In their study, State and Adamic asked the question: how many times do you need to see a friend change their profile picture before deciding to change your own? They set up two competing hypotheses. The first possibility was that profile changes spread like funny pictures and other online memes, falling off in influence as more people share them. The second possibility they considered was that people need to see others make the change before they follow suit, that “multiple exposures are most effective in determining the adoption of... [costly] behaviors.”  To test these competing hypotheses and develop a new model for how solidarity spreads from person to person, Facebook’s researchers classified profile images from over 3 million users in March 2013, along with 106 million users who were exposed to those changed profiles. Next, they predicted the likelihood of someone changing their profile to an equality image, depending on how many friends they had seen make the change. State and Adamic found that while someone’s likelihood to participate varied based on several factors—a person’s political affiliations, religion, and age, for example—the likelihood to change one’s profile image was greater with more exposures to changes by friends. According to State and Adamic, this likelihood increased “only for the first six exposures.” After the sixth exposure, the relationship “becomes virtually flat.”"

FOUNTAIN | Times] Mike Hughes of Largo, Pam Wilson of Indian Rocks Beach and Nora Harvey of Dunedin sit outside the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg protesting Sen. John McCain’s fundraiser there Wednesday. About 50 people, including Democrats and union members, came out against the presumptive Republican nominee for president, whom they called “McSame” as President Bush. Wilson made signs for the protest. Jack Ganzell of Dunedin, far right, says he came out because he wanted to see what was going on. Related Links Audio: Excerpts of McCain's interview with the Times' Adam Smith ST. PETERSBURG — Charlie Crist may not yet have a full gubernatorial term under his belt, but Sen. John McCain said Wednesday Crist has enough experience to be vice president. ""Oh, I am sure that in many respects Charlie Crist is qualified. He's had other offices. As we know, he was attorney general as well. This is a big and diverse state,"" McCain said in an interview Wednesday evening before a $1,000-per-person private fundraising reception. ""But we haven't moved anywhere on the process that he would be under,"" the presumptive Republican presidential nominee stressed. ""We have a large number of people that we are considering, but I just don't mention anybody's name because then it starts a process that could end up in an invasion of their privacy."" In a taped interview to air Sunday on Political Connections on Bay News 9, McCain said he will reach out to supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and noted his independence from President Bush on such issues as government spending and climate control. ""I promise them that I'll be the president of all the people, not just Republicans or anybody else, but all the people,"" McCain said. ""I realize that I have to get independents and Democrats if I'm going to win this election."" He also decried the giant Confederate flag that's been proposed to fly near the intersection of Interstates 4 and 75 in Hills­borough County. McCain has faced this issue before, and has voiced profound regret for not taking a stand against a rebel flag atop the South Carolina statehouse during the 2000 GOP primary. ""It's a free country,"" McCain said of the flag in Hillsborough, but he said the Civil War memorial group behind the flag plans ""should consider the feelings and sensitivities on this issue at a time like this in America where we want to move forward."" Now that the Democratic nominee has been chosen, McCain knows he faces an opponent in Sen. Barack Obama who is more inspiring and energetic on the stump. McCain isn't worried. ""I think people are very interested in substance, as well as style,"" he said. McCain also struck on a theme of his campaign, suggesting Obama lacks the experience and knowledge to be president. But polls show a strong majority of American voters think invading Iraq was a mistake, which is what Obama said all along. When asked if Obama showed better judgment in opposing the invasion, McCain defended the war as the right call because ""every intelligence agency in the world believed that (Saddam Hussein) had weapons of mass destruction."" What about Florida's Bob Graham, the former Senate Intelligence Committee chairman who argued at the time that invading Iraq would divert attention and resources from more urgent threats, particularly al-Qaida? ""I respect Sen. Graham enormously, but I don't think there's any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was … to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction,"" McCain replied. The private fundraising reception at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg kicked off a three-day Florida swing, which includes a speech to newspaper editors in Orlando today and an event touting his environmental credentials in the Everglades on Friday. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton dismissed McCain's efforts to cast himself as anything but a continuation of President Bush's agenda. ""While John McCain has a record of occasional independence from his party in the past, last year he chose to embrace 95 percent of George Bush's agenda, including his failed economic policies and his failed policy in Iraq,"" Burton said referring to McCain's voting record. ""No matter how hard he tries to spin it otherwise, that kind of record is simply not the change the American people are looking for or deserve."" McCain said he supports the antigay marriage ballot initiatives in Florida and California, even though the Republican governors of both states have little interest in those efforts. While he voted against a federal marriage amendment proposal, McCain noted that he supported a similar initiative in his home state of Arizona, where voters rejected the idea. ""I think it's important to preserve the unique status of a marriage between men and women,"" McCain said. ""I respect the views of others who don't hold that view, but I also think that we have a process in our states to amend our constitutions to reflect the will of the majority of the people."" Adam C.

pheme_96,0,Ottawa shooting: Kevin Vickers hailed as hero who helped stop attacker,"House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers was lauded by members of Parliament Wednesday for his reported role in stopping an assailant who killed a Canadian Forces member in Ottawa.  Vickers, 58, a native of Miramichi, N.B., was reportedly in the House of Commons when a gunman entered sometime after 9:52 a.m.  Two sources told The Canadian Press that Vickers shot the assailant inside the Hall of Honour, the main entrance to the Centre Block beneath the Peace Tower.  Officials have not confirmed that Vickers fired at the suspect, but multiple MPs credited Vickers on Twitter with helping to stop the attacker.  MPs tweet thanks  On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives:  ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms."" —New Democrat MP Craig Scott.  ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe."" —Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino.  ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes."" —Justice Minister Peter MacKay.  ""Kevin Vickers is such a fine man. His actions today are no surprise. Proud to call him a friend."" —Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.  Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security that included protecting foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family.  He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick. Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms, Vickers was director of security operations for the House of Commons.  The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament Buildings.  'You don't want to mess with him'  Vickers's brother John, who lives in Victoria, told CBC News Wednesday that his brother called their mother, Monica, at her New Brunswick home shortly after the incident to tell her he is safe.  ""I just couldn't be prouder of him right now,"" John said, adding that his brother has ""always been committed to service, people and country.""  When asked about Vickers’s reported heroics, his cousin Keith said “It’s Kevin being Kevin.”  “He’s a very intelligent and responsible person. He’s a people person-type fellow, too, but you don’t want to mess with him,” said Keith. “All the boys, the local guys, they’ll be quite proud to hear he did what he did.”  According to Keith, Vickers’s son is currently a police officer with the local force in Miramichi.  Dan Bussières, the current sergeant-at-arms in the New Brunswick Legislature and Vickers’s colleague in the RCMP for many years, called him “a true gentleman who is very responsible.”  “He’s the perfect man to be the sergeant-at-arms in Ottawa right now. I can assure you of that,” Bussières said.  Prior to his appointment in the House of Commons, Vickers worked as an aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's former lieutenant-governor, Marilyn Trenholme Counsell.  Vickers served under Trenholme Counsell for four years starting in 1999. She watched closely Wednesday as reports came in about the shootings in Ottawa and news that Vickers may have played a central role in the events.  Trenholme Counsell said she was not surprised to learn of his possible involvement.  ""Not at all, it's so much in his character to take charge of something and do what has to be done,"" she said from her home as TV news reports played in the background.  ""He is fearless in the face of a challenge. It didn't surprise me that he acted.""  As an RCMP officer, Vickers was responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.  He is a recipient of the Queen's Jubilee medal, the Canada 125 medal and the RCMP Long Service medal.  Former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who has also served as a security chief on Parliament Hill, called Vickers a ""natural planner"" and said his former RCMP colleague has always ""had a contingency plan.""  ""He actually did mock-up scenarios for the personnel ... very much like what happened today,"" Bourdas said. ""Knowing Kevin the way I do, he is very troubled by this chain of events.""  Sergeant-at-arms 1st line of safety  Although sergeants-at-arms often operate outside of the public spotlight, the events on Parliament Hill are not the first time they have been instrumental in preventing bloodshed in Canadian history.  When army supply clerk Denis Lortie opened fire in Quebec's National Assembly in 1984, the legislature's sergeant-at-arms went into the chamber and tried to calm him.  Rene Jalbert, a retired major in the army, offered Lortie a cigarette and eventually persuaded him to release about a dozen hostages who were cowering in the chamber.  The legislature was minutes away from convening when Lortie entered the building through a side door carrying two submachine guns, and at one point sat in the Speaker's chair firing wildly. He killed three people and wounded 13 others.  On mobile? Follow our live blog here"
politifact785,0,"Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit","Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit  Thursday, March 22, 2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact: Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market.  The text of the letter is below:  Dear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson,  There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures. Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.  We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.  Working together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody’s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.  The summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators’ Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:  What standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.  How to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.  How to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.  How to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.  How to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.  How to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.  Of course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.  Nevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don’t let this opportunity pass us by.  Sincerely,  U.S. Senator Barack Obama"
politifact10903,0,Estonia Might Have The Most Efficient Tax Filing System In The World,"Wikimedia Commons  It's true.  It turns out that one reason why Estonia has been the lone feel-good story amidst the Eurozone crisis is that its tax filing system is scarily efficient.  Introduced in 2000, the system allows individual income taxes, business taxes and excises to be filed electronically.  Using a secure ID, a filer simply completes pre-made forms and approves the document with a digital signature.  The process takes an average of five minutes, and last year 94% of tax declarations were filed electronically.  The system is part of the country's impressive e-government initiative, which allows Estonians to do everything from vote to fill out prescriptions to look up school grades online.  Estonians begin filing their taxes on Wednesday."
E648,0,"George Bush Was Paid $100,000 to Speak at Veterans Event","NEWS: Former President George W. Bush was paid $100,000 to speak at a charity fundraiser for wounded veterans in 2012.  Former President George W. Bush was paid $100,000 to speak at a 2012 charity fundraiser event for “Helping a Hero,” an organization that raises money for wounded veterans, officials from the charity confirmed to ABC News on 8 July 2015. According to those officials, the speaking fee was justified for two reasons: Bush had reduced his usual speaking fee of $250,000 to $100,000 for the event (a 2011 article pegged Bush’s standard speaking fee at between $100,000 and $150,000), and the former President helped bring in a record level of contributions to the charity:  According to the charity’s yearly reports to the IRS, it raised about $2,450,000, after expenses, from the 2012 gala where President Bush spoke. The following year, the gala netted the charity substantially less, about $1,000,000.  The Helping a Hero organization also took to Twitter to say that they were honored to have had President Bush as a speaker:  Others, however, felt that the former president should have waived his speaking fee for an event of this nature:  For him to be paid to raise money for veterans that were wounded in combat under his orders, I don’t think that’s right,” said former Marine Eddie Wright, who lost both hands in a rocket attack in Fallujah, Iraq in 2004. “You sent me to war,” added Wright speaking of the former President. “I was doing what you told me to do, gladly for you and our country and I have no regrets. But it’s kind of a slap in the face.”  Bush spokesperson Freddy Ford confirmed that Bush was paid $100,000 to speak at the event, and added that “President Bush has made helping veterans one of his highest priorities in his post presidency.”  George W. Bush isn’t the only prominent U.S. politician to come under fire recently over speaking fees. In 2014, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was criticized for accepting $225,000 fee for a speaking engagement at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Clinton responded to the controversy by declaring that she would donate the money to the Clinton Foundation charity."
pheme_40,0,Cpl. Nathan Cirillo dreamed of becoming full-time soldier,"The opening shots that began a devastating day on Parliament Hill killed a Hamilton reservist who dreamed of being a full-time soldier and deprived his kindergarten-aged son of his father.  Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot while on honorary guard at the National War Memorial. Ottawa Police announced hours after the shooting that the soldier shot at the memorial had died.  He would later be identified as Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment. Cirillo died a short time after the attack despite frantic efforts to revive him at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  Lt.-Col. Lawrence Hatfield of the Argylls made a brief statement on Wednesday night to reporters and members of the public who gathered outside the James Street armoury.  ""The regiment wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family of Cpl. Cirillo as well as to express our thanks that's been demonstrated by the support of Canadians across this country,"" he said. ""Cpl. Cirillo was a very proud member of the Argylls and the Highlanders of Canada. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and we hope that Canadians share that with us.""  Jim Cirillo, uncle of the deceased, said his nephew persevered and achieved great things after a sometimes difficult upbringing. (CBC)  Back in East Hamilton, the news spread through his extended the family. A distraught uncle, Jim Cirillo, answered the door to his Barton Street East home with swollen eyes, a TV locked on the 24-hour news cycle of the unfolding events, and a computer opened to a picture of his nephew, Nathan. Between tears, he pointed at the picture on the screen. He said his sister-in-law and mother to Nathan, Kathy, couldn’t believe the news.  “She's saying she doesn't believe it … She went on the internet and she saw it and she … I don't know how she didn't pass out.  “She's just completely broken, broken right now.""  Jim Cirillo said Nathan and his two sisters weren't ""dealt a good hand,"" with a difficult divorce splitting up their parents.  ""And now for him to get shot and pass away, I don't know if life is fair … he didn't deserve that,"" he said. ""I don't know how someone could have picked him out and do that.""  Joined cadets at 13  Along with Hamilton Police Chief Glenn De Caire, Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina visited the family and told reporters outside the armoury where Cirillo joined as a cadet when he was 13 years old that he expects the fallen soldier to have a funeral with “full service honours.”  ""It was very sad but there was some comfort in being with Chief De Caire, who has experience with dealing with sudden loss of life,"" Bratina said. ""We had some hugs and tears. One young boy walked in and said to his aunt, I believe it was, 'I saw you crying.'""  Bratina said Cirillo had two sisters, and was part of ""a typical Hamilton family. Beautiful home. Clean as a whip. Pictures of Nathan and his two sisters on the wall. It was the kind of place that any of us would feel right at home going into.""  Jim Cirillo confirmed that Nathan's father has been in Costa Rica for several years. Nathan had tried to reconnect with his father a few years ago, and had recently reconnected with his mother. She will be taking care of his son, Marcus, who just entered kindergarten, and his two dogs. The child's mother, who had the baby while Cirillo was still a teenager, is no longer in the picture.  Cirillo was a personal trainer, former Good Life fitness employee and bouncer at a downtown Hamilton bar, Club Absinthe.  Manager Billy Pozeg said he would often come straight from the armoury in his fatigues, and change at the club before his shifts, joking he would go from one service job to another. He added Cirillo would bring up the mood in a room with a smile as wide as his shoulders, adding his dream was to be a full-time member of the military.  His pictures posted on Facebook and Instagram show a man always smiling, who played guitar and loved his two large dogs. He posed for tourists shortly before he was attacked.  'Communication lockdown'  A source who asked not to be identified told CBC News in Hamilton that members from the unit have all been ordered not to speak about the incident.  Nathan Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, said Cirillo owned two German Shepherds. (Instagram)  ""They are now all on communication lockdown,"" the source said. ""They’ve been told to put their phones away and all bases are all locked down.""  Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, has been trying to make sense of the news all day. She first realized Cirillo had been shot when pictures of paramedics trying to save his life was shown on television Wednesday morning.  ""I saw his face and it was him,"" Michele said. ""That's how I found out it was Nathan.  ""Nathan was a good man. He would give anything to anyone,"" she said. ""He was there for everyone.""  Police have set up a roadblock around the Cirillo family's home in east Hamilton while they decide who will be their spokesperson.  Members of Canada’s Muslim community offered condolences to the family, condemning the attack.  “The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Canada categorically and unequivocally condemns this morning’s terror attacks on the Canadian Parliament and the National War Memorial as well as on the Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec,” the organization said in a statement released Wednesday. “These acts of terror have no basis in any religion.”  The Argylls are an infantry unit of the Canadian Forces primary reserves within 31 Canadian Brigade Group. It is one of the largest army reserve units in the country with over 250 soldiers.  'It broke my heart'  Retired Col. Geordie Elms said Hamilton’s Highland regiment served in the first two World Wars, as well as Afghanistan, contributing more manpower than any other militia in Ontario. He knew it was an Argyll when he saw the uniform.  “It was terrible anyway. Then it became clear where this had taken place. That’s a ceremonial duty that goes to commemorating our history,” Elms said. “It’s tragic that it’s one of our Argylls.”  On average, Elms said a reservist dedicates one night a week and one weekend a month to it. Every year, there’ll be a concentrated exercise where it might be a week or 10 days.  Elms said the greatest single force of reservist recruits is still students, because of the nature of the work and the potential to do training during the summer period.  A man in an Argylls jacket places flowers in memory of soldier Nathan Cirillo outside the gates of the John Weir Foote Armoury, the home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, in Hamilton. (Aaron Lynett/Canadian Press)  “For this particular task to guard the War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they would have put out a notice and he would have answered it,” Elms said. “It’s an honour and a privilege to do that duty, just as it would be if you were to be part of the ceremonial guard on Parliament Hill in the summertime. It’s a sought-after task. It’s not a task they have any trouble filling.”  The soldiers who were guarding the National War Memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and full-time and part-time soldiers are rotated through duty on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They carry rifles that aren't loaded.  CBC News has obtained a copy of an email directed to student soldiers with the Armed Forces telling them not to wear their uniforms, even on base.  Another email sent to military personnel authorized the wearing of uniforms on base, as well as inside their cars while travelling between the base and their homes, but that they should avoid wearing their uniforms in all other cases. The email also instructed military personnel in uniform not to make any stops — not even at gas stations, daycares, schools and elsewhere — while travelling between their base and home.  At the armoury in Hamilton, non-uniformed people were passing in and out of the gates, with uniformed guards standing watch at each side. People have been bringing flowers and notices of condolences to the building.  Veteran Ed Hughes dropped off a cross to the armoury Wednesday. ""I was injured in service,"" he said. ""It broke my heart when I found out he was from Hamilton. It broke my heart he was a Sutherland."""

Australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages early Tuesday, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, New South Wales police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione told reporters.  Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died, according to Scipione. They were later identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Other people were injured, including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets. All were described by police to be in stable condition.  ""Understandably, there is a lot of speculation, but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Tuesday.  Man Haron Monis.  What did the gunman want? Why did he choose the cafe as his target?  ""There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee, and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident,"" Abbott said.  He offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones.  ""These events do demonstrate that even a country as free as open as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence,"" the Prime Minister said.

Abbott told reporters that the gunman was already well-known to authorities, and that he had a ""long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability.""  Before the raid, Monis had demanded a flag and phone call with Abbott, CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported. He made the demands through hostages who contacted media organizations, Sky News reported.  Some hostages had also reportedly posted messages to social networking sites and the YouTube online video service. Police urged media early Tuesday not to show the videos.  Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, pleaded guilty in 2013 to writing letters to relatives of Australian service members saying they were ""Hitler's soldiers,"" according to Australian media reports.  He was believed to be acting alone, and he didn't appear to be part of a broader plot, additional U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources said.

Kristin Fisher reported that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence bulletin warning of a chance that an ISIS-inspired terror attack could occur in the U.S.  She said no specific or credible threat has been confirmed by officials.  However, a former Pentagon official told Fox News that ISIS views Independence Day as a key target, Fisher stated.  Federal authorities have disrupted a number of ISIS-inspired plots, including a planned assault earlier this month on Boston police officers.  On Friday, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a statement following the attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, saying in part, ""Particularly with the upcoming July 4th holiday here in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI continue to communicate with state and local law enforcement about what we know and see.""  ""We will also adjust security measures, seen and unseen, as necessary to protect the American people,'' Johnson stated.

E788,0,Duggar Dad's Political Platform: Incest Should Be Punishable by Death,"Last week, 19 Kids and Counting’s Josh Duggar admitted that he molested his sisters when he was a teenager. Though his parents Jim Bob and Michelle successfully helped him avoid prosecution for his crimes, a couple of men have defended the way the Duggars handled the abusive situation in their home. Mike Huckabee has stood by the family in the wake of the scandal, and Jessa Duggar’s father-in-law Michael Seewald has attested that Jim Bob and Michelle “acted in a way that godly parents should.”  But what does Jim Bob think of his own response to his son’s familial abuse? In a brief statement to People, Jim Bob and Michelle said last week that “that dark and difficult time caused us to seek God like never before.” Maybe that’s because Jim Bob publicly stated during his 2002 campaign for U.S. Senate that he thinks incest should be punishable by death.  Jim Bob’s platform on his campaign website—preserved via web cache—states that he believes “rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes.” Jim Bob offered this belief to explain his position on abortion (only acceptable if both the mother and the baby were going to die anyway, of course):  Jim Bob lost the Republican nomination for Senate to Arkansas’ incumbent Senator Tim Hutchinson. His son Josh remained very much alive and went on to molest several underage girls including some of his sisters from 2002-2003.  Got a tip about the Duggars? Email me at allie@gawker.com.  "
pheme_389,0,"Ottawa shooting: A day of chaos leaves soldier, gunman dead","Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.  The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.  Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.  It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.  CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.  He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.  In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.  ""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.  ""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the suspected gunman in Wednesday's Ottawa shootings, had a criminal record in B.C. and Quebec. (Twitter)  Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.  Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.  Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.  Caught 'by surprise'  In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""  ""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.  Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise.""

pheme_131,0,"Uber intros surge pricing during Sydney hostage siege, then backtracks after user outcry","This post was updated at 10:45 p.m. ET to include an updated statement from Uber.  Uber briefly charged its users in downtown Sydney a minimum $100 to escape an armed hostage crisis, a result of automatic surge pricing meant to get more drivers online.  An executive in the city's Central Business District (CBD) sent Mashable screenshots of the Uber app that showed the company was charging up to four-times the normal rate because ""demand is off the charts.""  Price surging was implemented in Sydney, Australia on Dec. 15th, 2014, during a hostage siege in the CBD. Image: Mashable  ""I have never, ever seen it at four-times [the normal rate] and I'm a 1% top Uber user,"" said Matthew Leung, the user in contact with Mashable. ""I understand the way the business works — higher the demand, higher the charge — but four-times at $100 minimum is ridiculous. Almost price gouging at its worst.""  Another customer shared a screenshot of their ""wack"" fare estimate that showed a trip from an area just blocks from the siege to the airport would cost $145-185. That journey would normally cost less than $100, according to Uber's website. ""This is price surging,"" he wrote in a comment to Mashable.  After Mashable published a story on the price hikes, the company reversed course and announced that all riders in the area would be free, and that anybody who had been charged the higher amount would be refunded.  ""We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,"" Uber spokesperson Katie Curran told Mashable in a statement. ""Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely.""  Image: Uber  Any riders who were charged the higher amount may email supportsydney@uber.com to get their refund, she said, adding that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.  Uber, the company said, will now pick up the tab.  Uber Sydney's Twitter account tweeted the info.  Uber rides out of the CBD today are free for all riders to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm for more info. — Uber Sydney (@Uber_Sydney) December 15, 2014  The crisis involves at least one hostage taker and about 13 hostages, all being held in a cafe in downtown Sydney, Australia.  At present, little is known about the assailant, other than the fact that an Islamic flag was shown in the cafe window, leading some to suspect that the incident may be a terrorist attack. Police have evacuated most of the area.  Following the police evacuation, many locals have reported difficulty in finding transportation as they attempt to exit the area.  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously said the company's pricing algorithms will be ""capped"" during situations like what's unfolding in downtown Sydney. ""For each market, the state of emergency price will be set after excluding the 3 highest-priced, non-emergency days of the preceding 2 months,"" he said, adding that the policy ""intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters.""  Last July, New York's attorney general announced that Uber agreed to put a cap on prices during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” meaning natural disasters and emergencies, to comply with the state's price gouging regulations. It isn't clear if a similar agreement is in effect in Australia.  Uber launched in Australia in Oct. 2012.  Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report. Have something to add to this story?

pheme_57,0,Police in Sydney: 3 dead in raid to free captives held by Iranian-born gunman,"Australian police say three people, including the gunman, are dead after a hostage siege that lasted for more than 16 hours at a cafe in downtown Sydney. They say the gunman died in a confrontation with police. (AP)  Australian police say three people, including the gunman, are dead after a hostage siege that lasted for more than 16 hours at a cafe in downtown Sydney. They say the gunman died in a confrontation with police. (AP)  In a blitz-style assault early Tuesday, Australian riot police ended a 16-hour hostage crisis as frightened captives rushed onto the streets amid intense gunfire that fatally wounded the self-styled Muslim cleric who held them.  A police statement said two people — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — died during the predawn police operation in downtown Sydney. The statement also said that a third person, described by police officials as the hostage-taker, was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital.  Four others were injured, including a police officer who suffered a gunshot wound to the face.  The motives for the hostage-taking at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe remain unclear. But the gunman was convicted last year of sending hate mail to families of Australian troops killed in Afghanistan and was facing other charges, including in connection with the killing of his former wife.  The decision to carry out the police raid was apparently prompted by worries that the gunman, identified as Iranian-born Man Haron Monis, was growing uneasy and had begun corralling some captives in a section of the cafe.  1 of 46 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hostage situation in Sydney View Photos Two Australians were killed after being held at gunpoint along with 15 others for more than 16 hours.

Gunman Haron Monis, a self-styled cleric born in Iran, was also killed when police stormed the cafe after a 16-hour standoff. Dean Lewins/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.  “They made the call because they believed that, at that time, if they didn’t enter, there would have been many more lives lost,” said Andrew Scipione, commissioner of the New South Wales state police.  The long showdown captured the world’s attention and raised questions about whether it was a “lone wolf” attack inspired by calls from militant groups such as the Islamic State. Earlier this month, when a woman in the United Arab Emirates fatally stabbed an American teacher, Abu Dhabi officials partially blamed the slaying on the influence of radical Islamists.  The Islamic State and other extremist groups have threatened Australia with violence for its participation in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria. Australia, in response, has imposed new security measures in recent months and made several arrests of suspects accused of plotting acts of violence.  The raid at the cafe began without warning. Suddenly, a series of bangs sounded — possibly from stun grenades — and a barrage of gunfire followed. Police poured in, weapons drawn and face masks in place. Hostages raced in the other direction, some with hands raised.  Scipione said the gunman initially took 17 people hostage. Five people later escaped as the drama unfolded, including scenes in which captives were forced to hold a black banner with Arabic writing to the window.  Monis, 50, a self-proclaimed “spiritual healer,” was sentenced to 300 hours of community service for sending the threatening and harassing letters to the families of the fallen military personnel. He was later charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He was also charged with sexually assaulting a woman in 2002. He was out on bail, the Reuters news agency reported.  Australia’s 9News said Monis — who also went by the names Sheik Haron and Mohammad Hassan Manteghi — moved to Australia in 1996 and was granted political asylum.  Videos posted to YouTube show Man Haron Monis, the man who is a suspect in the cafe hostage standoff in Sydney, wearing chains and holding a sign that reads, ""I have been Tortured In Prison For My Political Letters."" (The Washington Post)  His Web site shows graphic images of children who the site claims were killed by U.S. and Australian airstrikes. The site insists that Monis “supports his Muslim brothers [and] sisters” but is not affiliated with specific groups.  Still, authorities are certain to explore possible connections to Islamist factions or propaganda. Before the raid, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said only that the hostage-taker was “claiming political motivation.”  “The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves,” Abbott said.  Monis’s former attorney, Manny Conditsis, described him as an “isolated figure,” according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  “His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,” the lawyer said.  The events on Martin Place — near the landmark sail-shaped Sydney Opera House — began Monday morning as rush hour was just starting to quiet. Witnesses said they saw a man with a gun walk into the cafe about 9:45 a.m.  Soon, local TV stations showed footage shot through the cafe’s windows of people with their hands raised or palms pressed against the glass. Two held up a black banner bearing Arabic writing that expressed the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith: “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the messenger of God.”  About 4 p.m., three men ran from the cafe’s fire exit, one of them wearing a brown Lindt cafe apron. About an hour later, two women sprinted out the same side door, into the arms of police. Both also were wearing Lindt aprons and appeared to be employees.  Although many details about the siege remain unanswered, the choice of the location suggested that it was picked for maximum effect. The cafe is just yards from the newsroom of Channel Seven, the nation’s most-watched commercial broadcaster. Within minutes, a huge media contingent was camped across from the cafe.  One radio reporter said that he received a call from a “young person” held inside the cafe but that it would have been “irresponsible” to put the caller on the air in case the broadcast endangered others.  “I could hear the hostage-taker in the background issuing instructions to him on what to request me to say on air,” the reporter, Ray Hadley of Radio 2GB, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  Hadley only broadcast an impassioned plea: “If there are no children in there, please release the women.”  About 9 p.m., the lights in the cafe were switched off. Police officers put on night-vision goggles and reinforced the cordon around the building.  The raid came several hours later. By 2:45 a.m, police had declared the operation over.  Muslim leaders in Australia, including the grand mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, deplored the  hostage-taking as a “criminal act.”  While the hostage crisis was underway, downtown Sydney was placed on lockdown, evoking memories of a similar street-clearing order in late October after a lone gunman stormed the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa.  Helicopters hovered over the city. Surrounding streets and a train station were shut down. The opera house, the state library and the U.S. Consulate General were evacuated, and the opera house canceled Monday evening’s performances.  After the incident, world leaders were briefed on the situation. President Obama spoke with Lisa Monaco, his counterterrorism adviser.  One woman sent a text to her cousin — a single exclamation point — from the cafe moments after it was seized.  “I knew there was something wrong,” the relative told the Daily Mail Australia, declining to give her name at the time because of fears that it could put her cousin in danger.

politifact489,0,"U.S. considers 3,000 more troops for Afghanistan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates will consider sending some 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan to thwart any spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.  U.S and Dutch soldiers drive along a dusty road in a village in Baluchi pass in Uruzgan province, Afghanistan November 1, 2007. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic  “This proposal is coming before the secretary this week,” Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. “He will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it.”  Violence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country.  For months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces.  Gates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- a record high.  Around half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops.  While NATO says it thwarted last year’s attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month.  IN PLACE BY APRIL  Morrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting.  “The idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back,” he told reporters. “The timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment.”  After meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops.  He suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden.  “The commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load,” Morrell said.  U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States.  Morrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday.  The plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces.  The Pentagon’s Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said."

pheme_148,0,,"Maya Vidon-White and William M. Welch  USA TODAY  PARIS — Authorities identified three suspects in a deadly shooting attack on a satirical newspaper that killed 12 people Wednesday as thousands jammed a public square for an evening vigil honoring victims of France's deadliest terror attack in a half century.  Two of those killed were police officers, one of them shot dead on a sidewalk outside the newspaper. Eight journalists were among the victims.  The suspects are two brothers — Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both French nationals — and Hamyd Mourad, 18, whose nationality wasn't known, a Paris police official told the Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.  The youngest suspect surrendered at a police station in Charleville-Mezieres, a small town in France's eastern Champagne region, Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. French police early Thursday released photos of the brothers they were seeking, saying they should be considered armed and dangerous.  French news media reported late Wednesday that a major police operation was taking place around an apartment building in Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris.  The brothers were born in Paris of Algerian descent. Cherif was sentenced to three years in prison on terrorism charges in May 2008. Both brothers returned from Syria this summer.  At least 15,000 gathered at the Place de la République for a vigil after the three gunmen, wearing hoods and armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, shouting Islamic phrases and killing 12 people. The publication is a satirical newspaper that has caricatured the prophet Mohammed.  ""They wanted to put France down on its knees, but we will show them solidarity and unity,"" Ilan Scialom, 30, vice president of COEXISTER, an interfaith group in Paris that promotes tolerance, said at the Paris rally. Thousands turned out for similar vigils in Lyon and elsewhere across Europe. Some held signs saying, ""Not afraid.""      There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the midday attack.  Eight journalists, a guest and two police officers were killed, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, giving a partial breakdown of the dead. Among those killed were Bernard Maris, an economist who contributed to the newspaper and was heard regularly on French radio, and cartoonists Georges Wolinski and Berbard Verlhac, better known as Tignous.  President Francois Hollande called the attack a terrorist act ""of exceptional barbarism,"" and said other attacks have been thwarted in France in recent weeks. Fears have been running high in France and elsewhere in Europe that jihadis returning from conflicts in Syria and Iraq will stage attacks at home.  Cherif Kouachi was well known to French law enforcement. At 26, he was sentenced to three years in prison with 18 months suspended for criminal association with a terrorist enterprise for his conviction in 2008 as part of a group of seven men.  Prosecutors said the group recruited French Muslims to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group, known as the 19th Arrondissement Network for the working class Paris district where it was based, allegedly recruited young men, arranged for weapons training and helped them travel though Syria to Iraq. Police arrested Kouachi in January 2005, days before he allegedly planned to travel to Syria.  The rampage began around noon when the suspects killed a receptionist to gain entrance to the offices in central Paris, then opened fire on a second-floor editorial meeting, killing 10 people, Molins said. The officers were killed during the suspects' getaway, he said.  Eleven others were injured, including four who were listed in serious condition.  Molins said the attackers shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"") and the ""prophet is avenged"" before fleeing in a stolen black Citroen, exchanging gunfire at least twice with police outside.  Cartoonist Corine Rey, also known as ""Coco,"" told the weekly Humanité that she was forced at gunpoint to allow the men inside the building.  ""They shot (cartoonists) Wolinski, Cabu … it lasted about five minutes,"" she told the newspaper, according to France24. ""I took cover under a desk. … They spoke perfect French. … They said they were al-Qaeda.""  The dead included Stephane Charbonnier, the weekly newspaper's editorial director known as Charb, spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre of the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed. Charb's bodyguard — assigned to him after death threats — was among those killed, said Christophe Crepin, a police union spokesman. Four cartoonists whose work included controversial drawings of the prophet Mohammed were killed.  In response to the death threats, Charb, according to France24, told colleagues at one point, ""I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees.""  One police officer was shot execution-style on a sidewalk. The gunman, in a chilling video taken from a second-floor balcony, opened fire on a police officer, who collapsed. One of the gunmen then calmly walked up to the officer and killed him, before returning to the getaway car with his fellow assailant.  The newspaper's editor, Gerard Biard, escaped the attack because he was in London.  The publication, whose barbs are aimed at a wide range of religious and political institutions, has been heavily criticized by Muslims for years. In 2011, its offices were firebombed after a spoof issue featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover.  In Paris, as word of the killings spread, crowds gathered for an impromptu show of support at the Place de la République.  By evening, Parisians huddled under the arm of the statue of the Glory of the Republic of France, clapped and chanted ""Charlie"" and ""Liberté."" Many held signs that read, ""Je suis Charlie"" (""I am Charlie""), while others held up pens to symbolize the freedom of the press.  ""I'm under shock, I think like all French journalists. I came here because I wanted to express my solidarity with Charlie and show my support for freedom of expression,"" said Sarah Halifa-Legrand, a reporter attending the vigil. ""There are so many people, everywhere in the square. Some have climbed up on the statue; people have lit up little candles. It's very touching. There's not so much noise, it's quiet. People are mourning. It's very moving.""  In Washington, President Obama condemned the ""horrific shooting"" and said the United States was in touch with French officials ""to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.""  Secretary of State John Kerry called the incident a ""murderous attack"" and said ""each and every American"" stood beside France.  The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers and the World Editors Forum condemned the assault.  ""An attack of this nature strikes at the heart of the very freedoms that the press in France so passionately defends,"" WAN-IFRA CEO Vincent Peyrègne said in a statement. ""It is not just an attack against the press, but also an attack on the fabric of our society and the values for which we all stand.""  Welch reported from Los Angeles.

Sources tell JP that there are two men, including a Lubavitch Hasid, two women and an 11-month-old baby among the hostages.  The gunman at the Kosher Deli has threatened to kill the hostages if police storm the Kouachi brothers currently holding one hostage in a print shop in a town north of Paris.  The gunman is believed to be the same man who killed a policewoman in Montrouge in Paris yesterday.Local media is reporting that two people have been killed during a shootout at the kosher Deli.  The police have named two suspects wanted in connection with the siege at the deli – Amedy Coulibaly and Hayat Boumeddiene.  Police order all shops closed in the Jewish neighborhood in central Paris far from attacks.  The French president ordered the country’s top security official to the scene, an official in the presidency told The Associated Press.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also reportedly ordered Israeli MFA officials and the Mossad to give the French government all the assistance needed in fighting the terror wave in Paris."
pheme_259,0,Sydney Hostage Siege Ends With Gunman and 2 Captives Dead as Police Storm Cafe,"Even so, it remained unclear whether Mr. Monis had any accomplices.  The armed man took control of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe on Martin Place in central Sydney around 9:45 a.m. Monday, trapping employees and customers inside. He had a black flag with white Arabic script, similar to those used by Islamic militants on other continents, which was later displayed in a cafe window.  During the day Monday, five people fled the cafe, including two employees, but it was not clear whether the assailant had allowed them to leave or they had escaped.  Auto and rail traffic was halted and nearby buildings like the New South Wales Parliament and the Reserve Bank were evacuated or locked down, and helicopters circled overhead. Police officials said they made contact with the hostage-taker and tried to negotiate an end to the siege.  Mr. Monis was known to the police. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, he was free on bail in two separate criminal cases. He was charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact in the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, and in April 2014, he was charged with the indecent and sexual assault of a woman in western Sydney in 2002. Forty more counts of indecent or sexual assault relating to six other women were later added in that case.  Mr. Monis pleaded guilty in 2013 to 12 charges related to the sending of poison-pen letters to the families of Australian servicemen who were killed overseas, local media reports said. He was reportedly sentenced to probation and community service."
pheme_398,0,"Uber intros surge pricing during Sydney hostage siege, then backtracks after user outcry","This post was updated at 10:45 p.m. ET to include an updated statement from Uber.  Uber briefly charged its users in downtown Sydney a minimum $100 to escape an armed hostage crisis, a result of automatic surge pricing meant to get more drivers online.  An executive in the city's Central Business District (CBD) sent Mashable screenshots of the Uber app that showed the company was charging up to four-times the normal rate because ""demand is off the charts.""  Price surging was implemented in Sydney, Australia on Dec. 15th, 2014, during a hostage siege in the CBD. Image: Mashable  ""I have never, ever seen it at four-times [the normal rate] and I'm a 1% top Uber user,"" said Matthew Leung, the user in contact with Mashable. ""I understand the way the business works — higher the demand, higher the charge — but four-times at $100 minimum is ridiculous. Almost price gouging at its worst.""  Another customer shared a screenshot of their ""wack"" fare estimate that showed a trip from an area just blocks from the siege to the airport would cost $145-185. That journey would normally cost less than $100, according to Uber's website. ""This is price surging,"" he wrote in a comment to Mashable.  After Mashable published a story on the price hikes, the company reversed course and announced that all riders in the area would be free, and that anybody who had been charged the higher amount would be refunded.  ""We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,"" Uber spokesperson Katie Curran told Mashable in a statement. ""Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely.""  Image: Uber  Any riders who were charged the higher amount may email supportsydney@uber.com to get their refund, she said, adding that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.  Uber, the company said, will now pick up the tab.  Uber Sydney's Twitter account tweeted the info.  Uber rides out of the CBD today are free for all riders to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm for more info. — Uber Sydney (@Uber_Sydney) December 15, 2014  The crisis involves at least one hostage taker and about 13 hostages, all being held in a cafe in downtown Sydney, Australia.  At present, little is known about the assailant, other than the fact that an Islamic flag was shown in the cafe window, leading some to suspect that the incident may be a terrorist attack. Police have evacuated most of the area.  Following the police evacuation, many locals have reported difficulty in finding transportation as they attempt to exit the area.  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously said the company's pricing algorithms will be ""capped"" during situations like what's unfolding in downtown Sydney. ""For each market, the state of emergency price will be set after excluding the 3 highest-priced, non-emergency days of the preceding 2 months,"" he said, adding that the policy ""intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters.""  Last July, New York's attorney general announced that Uber agreed to put a cap on prices during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” meaning natural disasters and emergencies, to comply with the state's price gouging regulations. It isn't clear if a similar agreement is in effect in Australia.  Uber launched in Australia in Oct. 2012.  Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report. Have something to add to this story?

politifact1361,0,"Switchboard, from NRDC :: Barbara Finamore's Blog :: China’s Carbon Intensity Target","China yesterday announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will attend the Copenhagen climate summit and that he will bring with him a target for China of reducing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Coming a day after the announcement across the Pacific that President Obama will attend the beginning of the summit, bringing a commitment to reduce U.S. emissions ""in the range of 17%"" from 2005 levels by 2020, this means that we now know what the world's two largest emitters will be bringing to the table when the world's countries gather in Copenhagen.  The official announcement (in Chinese here) notes that on November 25, Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council standing committee met and decided upon the 2020 target and corresponding measures to achieve it. Of note are the following points:  1.) What exactly does the carbon intensity target cover? China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry. This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.  China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.

This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry. 2.) How will this be implemented? In order to measure the progress it is making in achieving this target, China will include the carbon intensity target in its medium and long-term social and economic development plans and develop corresponding statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems to measure progress. Thus, we can expect that the next five year plan (2010-2015) will include systems for monitoring and evaluating officials' and enterprises' performance in meeting the specific carbon intensity reduction targets allocated to them, similar to how the government implemented its target setting and official evaluation system for the twenty percent energy intensity reduction target in the current 11th Five Year Plan.

Will the target be binding internationally? At the moment, the carbon intensity target is only a voluntary action and is not intended to be binding internationally. However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""约束性"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets.

However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""约束性"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets. 4.) Is the 40 - 45% target significant? Although there is debate about how much of a reduction this 40 to 45 percent carbon intensity reduction target is from a ""business as usual"" scenario, we should keep in mind a few points. First, how we define ""business as usual"" matters. As part of its current 11th Five Year Plan, China took on a goal of reducing its energy intensity by 20% from 2006-10, which has led to a coordinated energy efficiency program that includes actions such as closing down smaller, inefficient power plants and outdated, inefficient iron and steel, cement and other manufacturing capacity, and improving the efficiency of the Top 1,000 energy consuming enterprises. If China succeeds in reducing its energy intensity by 20% by 2010, this would result in the avoidance of a billion tons of CO2 emissions. China should be given credit for these efforts and not penalized for taking early action.  Second, the International Energy Agency has noted that the commitments from China and the US are roughly in line with the actions they have estimated to be necessary to reach a concentration of 450 parts CO2 per million, what scientists have deemed is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius. While we would hope that both China and the U.S. will seek to raise the level of their ambition, both proposals are substantial and require real improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy to achieve.  The other important thing to remember is the significance of the carbon intensity target for creating the proper framework and incentives for reducing emissions. As noted above, a carbon intensity target will require each province and major enterprise to measure, report and reduce their CO2 emissions and energy consumption, year-on-year, acting as a driver for greater efficiency and renewables. In this way, the carbon intensity target is similar to the US greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule or the cap-and-trade system in the current climate legislation before Congress, which put in place the proper incentives and systems to transition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy. Provinces, local governments and enterprises will need to establish and improve systems for measuring and reporting emissions, and there will be increasing pressure on these enterprises and provinces to enact measures within their development plans for making continuous improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the national level, China will need to continue and accelerate its policies to boost energy efficiency and renewables, and it will need to build its capacity to measure and report emissions for its national greenhouse gas inventory on a yearly basis (something which EPA and China's National Development and Reform Commission have recently agreed to cooperate on).  Just as important as the targets they have set for themselves, China and the US must continue to accelerate their efforts to develop low carbon economies based on energy efficiency, renewables, and the development of clean technologies such as smart grids and electric vehicles. Both countries stand to benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy, by growing new clean industries and jobs, reducing their independence on dirty fossil fuels, and reducing their contribution to climate change and environmental damage. China can achieve a substantial reduction in its carbon intensity while continuing to grow its economy and providing an improved standard of living and a better environment for its citizens.  China's carbon intensity target is certainly a step in the right direction, and it provides the right incentives for future improvements in reducing emissions. Following the U.S.'s own emissions reduction announcement and the recent bilateral clean energy initiatives announced during President Obama's visit, we are beginning to see the outlines for a meaningful framework agreement in Copenhagen and a foundation for both countries to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change."

pheme_71,0,Witnesses describe chaos in Canada shootings: 'Rounds of handgun fire',"(CNN) -- Peter Henderson heard gunshots ring out late Wednesday morning from the National War Memorial in downtown Ottawa, Canada, as workers were rolling into the office a little late, coffee in hand.  ""I was locking my bike up, and I heard four shots,"" said Henderson, a journalist who reports on the telecom market.  He looked toward the memorial's soaring granite arch and saw a fallen soldier, in ceremonial uniform with white gloves. The soldier had been standing guard at the monument with a second soldier.  ""I saw one of the soldiers laying on the ground,"" Henderson said.  The soldier appeared to be shot in the back, with ""catastrophic"" wounds, Henderson said. That soldier later died, according to a statement from the Ottawa Police Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  Other witnesses, including members of Parliament, flooded social media with accounts of the attack, including photos and videos. Collectively they painted a portrait of chaos breaking out on an otherwise routine day near the corridors of power in the Canadian capital.  Police reported at least two shooting incidents in downtown Ottawa: at the National War Memorial Museum and on Parliament Hill.  One suspect was killed, the police statement said, and the joint police operation continued throughout the afternoon in a search for possibly other suspects.  In the immediate aftermath of the war-memorial shooting, the second soldier on guard duty ""ran for cover,"" Henderson said. The guards are thought to hold rifles that are not loaded, he added.  The shots sounded like they came from a high-powered rifle, Henderson said.  Later, bystanders rushed to the fallen soldier and began to perform CPR, he explained.  ""To the best of my knowledge, (he) looked like ... a young man,"" Henderson said. ""It appeared as though he had been hit in the back several times.""  At Parliament, shots rang out at around 10 a.m. ET as Parliament members, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, prepared for caucus. Some members tweeted that they heard many shots.  MP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues.  He tweeted that Harper was secure.  Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux was attending a caucus meeting when security told everyone to clear the building.  ""I honestly thought it was a fire alarm situation,"" Lamoureux told CNN.  As soon as he was leaving the caucus room, he heard the gunfire, he said.  ""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Lamoureux said.  He was inside Parliament, on the ground floor, when shots rang out. He was one level below the gunshots and was among those who were evacuated to another building nearby.  There was panic as people rushed out a door, he said. Lamoureux said he heard no screaming or other sounds before the shots rang out.  Lamoureux also saw the prime minister's motorcade leave the building.  Parliament member Kyle Seeback tweeted: ""Horrific day on parliament hill. Shots fired inside centre block during our caucus meeting. I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security.""  Another member Tony Clement tweeted, ""I'm with colleagues Mark Strahl and Kyle Seeback. PM was in Caucus but now secure. Assuming it's not safe to venture out yet ...""  Clement tweeted that there were ""at least 30 shots.""  Ottawa journalist Josh Wingrove told CNN that he saw someone injured -- he described it as a motionless ""body"" -- in the main building, near the entrance to the Parliament library, following the gunfire.  Wingrove was inside Parliament and heard dozens of shots.  Wednesday morning's gunfire in the main Parliament building started in the foyer, and a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove said. Several officers had weapons drawn, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appear to have been fired by officers at the gunman, Wingrove said.  Wingrove was among those forced to remain in the building during a police lockdown, as officers checked each room, he said on his Twitter account.  After the gunfight, ""the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways,"" he tweeted.  Matt Millar, the Ottawa bureau chief of the Vancouver Observer, was in the hallway above the gunfire in Parliament.  He heard what he described as a very loud noise ""followed by several shouts and, by my count, about three dozen rounds of handgun fire.""  He and colleagues escaped their office by breaking a window on the third story, and construction workers assembled scaffolding to help them, Millar said.  But he and others had to undergo hours of lockdown Wednesday in a secure building ""just a stone's throw from (Parliament Hill)l,"" Millar told CNN.  Member of Parliament John McKay recalled hearing ""pop, pop, pop"" as he was entering his caucus room.  ""I was walking to my caucus room and literally taking off my coat when I heard this pop, pop, pop -- didn't really think much of it -- thought it was frankly construction"" on Parliament Hill, he told CNN. ""Then the security people came racing down the hall and ushered us out of the building ASAP.""  When they arrived outside in the back of the Parliament buildings, ""a construction guy says maybe if there's people inside shooting, maybe we should be standing behind one of the monuments instead of standing out here like sitting ducks,"" McKay said.  McKay and the group then found a monument as a shield against a potential gunman, he said.  As the group talked about how the gunman apparently ventured near caucus rooms, ""at that point things really started to sink in and you realize it's a significant incident,"" McKay said.  John Ivison, a political columnist for the National Post, was five minutes from Parliament Hill when reports came about the gunfire at the war memorial. He and a colleague arrived at the monument ""to find a scene that is going to change this country forever,"" Ivison wrote.  Ivison's first-person account included a photograph he took of the mortally wounded soldier being attended by four people providing medical care.  ""The young soldier was wearing a kilt -— he is a reservist from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada in Hamilton — and appeared to have a bloody chest wound. The thought struck me that there should be a very special place in Hell reserved for a terrorist who shoots a soldier guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier that honours this country's fallen,"" Ivison wrote.  He posted a note on his Twitter page: ""Canada has just lost its innocence.""  ""Maybe it was naïve, we probably lost our innocence a long time ago. But there was a very real sense that nothing will ever be the same again,"" Ivison wrote in the National Post.  Dutch tourist Jan Lugtenborg saw the gunman running from the war memorial to Parliament, he told CNN partner and Canadian broadcaster CBC.  ""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" Lugtenborg said. ""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair ... with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill.""  Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, told CBC that he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans, who hopped over the stone fence surrounding Parliament Hill. The gunman forced someone out of a car and then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh told CBC."

pheme_14,0,Gun attack on French satirical magazine kills 12,"Gunmen armed with assault rifles kill 12 people in an attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.  (Warning: this video contains graphic scenes which some viewers may find distressing)  French President Francois Hollande has described the attack as being “without doubt a terrorist attack”. Four more people are seriously injured.  Graphic footage has been posted on social media, showing two men dressed in black shooting and injuring a police officer in the street before running over to shoot the officer dead on the pavement. The two men then return to a black car stopped in the road before the video ends.  I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war. Gerard Biard, editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo  French news website 20minutes.fr reported one eye witness as saying the men shouted as they approached the building: “You say to the media that it was al-Qaeda in Yemen”.  Confirmed deaths    Cartoonist Corine Rey told the French weekly Humanite that she was forced at gunpoint to open the office door, and then hid under a desk as the shooting took place. Her fellow cartoonists Stephanie “Charb” Charbonnier, Jean Cabu, Bernard “Tignou” Verlhac and George Wolinski were reported to have been killed in the attack, as well as economist Bernard Maris who was a Charlie Hebdo shareholder.  Mr Charbonnier was editor in chief of the magazine when it was targeted in a 2011 arson attack after running a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed.  He was included in a 2013 Wanted Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam article published by al-Qaeda’s magazine “Inspire”.  Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief Gerard Biard, who was in London at the time of the attack, has told France Inter: “I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.”  The French National Police is in pursuit of three suspects thought responsible for the shooting, officials said on Wednesday. It seems the attack was carefully planned as it apparently happened when an editorial meeting was taking place, meaning more staff members than usual were in the office.  Workers elsewhere in the building fled to the roof as the attack took place.

Police have launched a manhunt across the capital. Interior Minister Manuel Valls said three men were being sought.  The Union des Organisations Islamiques de France (UOIF), which represents more than 250 Muslim organisations across France, condemned the killings.  Religions, like all other ideas deserve criticism, satire and, yes, our fearless disrespect Salman Rushdie, author  “Charlie Hebdo has just become the target of an appalling attack,” the group said in a statement. “The UOIF condemns, in the strongest possible terms, this criminal attack and these horrible murders. “The UOIF offers its condolences to the families as well as the employees of Charlie Hebdo.”  The attack on Charlie Hebdo coincided with the publication of a controversial novel by French author Michel Houellebecq, whose latest work Submission has been branded Islamophobic by critics.    Houellebecq, whose caricature featured on the front cover of this week's edition of Charlie Hebdo, imagines France in 2022, with the leader of a fictional Muslim party winning the presidential election and curtailing civil liberties. Houellebecq has been accused of giving succour to the far right, but has denied charges of Islamophobia.  Speaking in London, Prime Minister David Cameron said: “The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.”  US President Barack Obama said he “strongly condemns” the horrific shooting, and promised to provide any assistance needed to “help bring these terrorists to justice”.  The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, condemned the attack and called for people to join a silent protest march on Thursday.  Charlie Hebdo has previously been firebombed after publishing a spoof edition in 2011 “guest edited” by the Prophet Mohammed. It showed a cartoon of Mohammed, with the words “100 lashes if you don’t die of laughter.”  In 2006, the magazine, which prides itself on being offensive to practically everyone, republished cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed which had caused controversy when they first appeared in a Danish newspaper.  The last tweet sent from the Charlie Hebdo account sent “best wishes” to the leader of the Islamic State militant group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Reports in France have suggested the attack was carried out during editorial conference to discuss the next issue of the magazine – an Islam-themed edition.  Author Salman Rushdie said in a statement: “I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. ‘Respect for religion’ has become a code phrase meaing ‘fear of religion.’  “Religions, like all other ideas deserve criticism, satire and, yes, our fearless disrespect.”"
politifact11115,0,Inquiry Sought in Hillary Clinton’s Use of Email,"The department is now reviewing some 55,000 pages of emails. A first batch of 3,000 pages was made public on June 30.  In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status.” But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.  In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.  The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.  The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.  In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,” she said. “There is no classified material. So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”  In May, the F.B.I. asked the State Department to classify a section of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.  As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.    Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.  Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.  I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.  However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.  Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.  My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.  The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.  Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.  The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.  There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.  Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties."

Sarah Palin background,"Editor's note: This story was originally published April 22, 2007  The state has tried selling its unwanted jet online four times and failed. So last week, the Palin administration signed a contract with an Anchorage aircraft broker who thinks he can succeed where eBay couldn't The eBay thing didn't work out very well, said Dan Spencer, director of administrative services for the Department of Public Safety. He's the person charged with trying to get rid of the infamous Westwind II.  The administration made a deal last week with Turbo North Aviation, promising the broker a 1.49 percent cut of the selling price.  Former Gov. Frank Murkowski bought the jet, which cost the state about $2.6 million, over the protests of the Legislature and used it to fly around the state, sometimes mixing campaign errands with government business.  After he defied almost everyone to acquire it, the jet became a political albatross for Murkowski. Gov. Sarah Palin beat Murkowski bad in last August's Republican primary. One of her campaign promises was to sell the plane and she's been trying to unload it for months. Robert Heckmann owns Turbo North Aviation. He said his company has sold more than 1,800 planes including two dozen or so jets in the past 27 years.  Spencer said Heckmann suggested the asking price of $2,450,000, based on the current jet market.  The state's definitely not going to give this plane away. If that was the case, then they would have sold it on eBay Heckmann said. He described prospective buyers a governments, corporate entities, oil companies, movie stars, well-to-do people.  Meanwhile, the state is stuck making quarterly payments of about $62,000 on the Westwind II. So is the state sick of dealing with this bird?  I don't know about anyone else Spencer said. You don't want to keep making payments on something you're not using, he said. l'll be happy when it sells. I'll be a happy guy."

The shooting occurred in southwestern suburb of Montrouge at about 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters at the scene that two officers had been shot and the suspect was ""still at large.""  France was marking a day of mourning as the massive manhunt continued for two heavily-armed brothers suspected of carrying out Wednesday's massacre at Charlie Hebdo.  Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that several people had been arrested since Wednesday's attack. Christophe Crepin of the UNSA police union said the arrests followed a raid on an apartment in Reims and that those held were connected to the suspects.  Montrouge mayor Pierre Brossollette told The Associated Press that the officer slain on Thursday and a colleague went to the site to deal with a traffic accident. A car stopped and a man got out and shot at them before fleeing.  ""I heard a gunshot but I thought it was construction,"" nearby resident Linda Pluchon, 45, told NBC News.

""I heard someone shout ‘Get help!’,” she said. “I saw two people who were flattening themselves against a wall … and then my neighbor told me not to go outside.""  Agnes Thibeaud, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, confirmed the female officer's death and said there was no direct link to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The condition of the other victim was unclear.  In a later announcement, the prosecutor's office said the investigation had been assigned to a counter-terrorist unit ""given the current context"" and because the heavily-armed perpetrator appeared to have ""deliberately targeted security forces.""  Wednesday’s atrocity at Charlie Hebdo prompted condemnation and protests around the world.  Police issued an appeal for sightings of Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his brother, Said, 34, warning that the pair should be considered ""armed and dangerous.” Cherif Kouachi served 18 months in prison on a charge of criminal association related to a terrorist enterprise after being convicted in 2008. He was part of an Islamist cell enlisting French nationals from a mosque in eastern Paris to go to Iraq to fight Americans in Iraq and arrested before leaving for Iraq himself.  Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said Kouachi are wanted in connection with Wednesday's Charlie Hebdo attack, according to French police. Judicial Police of Paris / AFP - Getty Images  A third suspect, 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, surrendered at a police station in Charlieville-Mezieres, near the eastern border with Belgium.  Valls attended a crisis meeting in Paris Thursday morning. He said the suspects were likely to have been under the watch of authorities.  ""We are facing an terrorist threat that is without precedent,” he told French radio station RTL, saying police had foiled many other planned attacks but there was “no such thing as a zero risk” from terror.  Despite the shootings, it was business as usual on the streets of Paris on Thursday as commuters calmly headed to work hours after thousands defiantly showed their solidarity with the 12 victims.  A nationwide minute's silence was held at noon local time (6 a.m. ET) and President Francois Hollande attended a ceremony in memory of those slain.  Hundreds stood in the rain outside Notre Dame cathedral in Paris to observe the silence. Even the capital's subway system paused to mark the moment, users said.

An explosion was also reported near a mosque in Villefranche-sur-Saône, France, early Thursday. ""I'm worried that this is tied to the dramatic events of Wednesday,"" Mayor Bernard Perrut told Le Progres.  France raised its terror alert system to the maximum and bolstered security at media offices, places of worship, transport and other sensitive areas after Wednesday’s massacre.  The attackers, wearing balaclavas, arrived at the building where Charlie Hebdo is based and killed a maintenance worker on the way in before heading to the third-floor editorial offices of the magazine. There, they shot dead eight journalists, a guest and a police officer who had been assigned to protect workers.  ""Hey! We avenged the Prophet Muhammad!

pheme_220,0,Sydney Siege Ends: Police Storm Cafe Where Man Haron Monis Held Hostages,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner.

Germanwings has confirmed 144 passengers, and six crew members were on board flight 4U9525.  French prime minister Manuel Valls said a helicopter that reached the crash site confirmed there were no survivors.  French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that one of the black boxes from the plane has been found, raising hopes of determining the cause of the crash.  ""A black box that we found a few hours after the crash will immediately be examined to help the investigation move forward quickly,"" he told reporters.  He said the crash site would be secured this evening to ensure emergency services could more easily enter the area.  French president Francois Hollande said there was likely to be a significant number of German victims and that he believed another 45 passengers to be Spanish and ""probably"" some Turks.  Mr Hollande said that he could not say with ""total certainty"" that no French nationals were aboard the flight.  Mr Hollande said the accident happened in ""a zone that is particularly hard to access"".  Germanwings said its Airbus A320 started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.  ""The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers ended at 10:53 am (local time) at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,"" Germanwings managing director Thomas Winkelmann said.  The plane had taken off from Barcelona airport at 10:01 am (local time) according to Mr Winkelmann.  A spokesman for the DGAC aviation authority said the airplane crashed near the town of Barcelonnette, about 100 kilometres north of the French Riviera city of Nice.  DGAC said the Germanwings crew did not issue a distress call, rather controllers declared a distress phase after contact was lost.  Lufthansa 'deeply shocked and saddened' by crash  Lufthansa confirmed that a Germanwings plane carrying 144 passengers and six crew had ""suffered an accident"" over the French Alps.  ""Everyone at Germanwings and Lufthansa is deeply shocked and saddened by these events,"" the company said in a tweet.  Airbus also confirmed the crash and said it would send a team of technical advisors to assist the investigation.  ""Airbus will make further factual information available as soon as the details have been confirmed and cleared by the authorities for release,"" Airbus said in a statement.  The crashed A320 is 24 years old and has been with the parent Lufthansa group since 1991, according to online database airfleets.net.  Germanwings managing director Thomas Winkelmann said the last routine check and inspection of the aircraft took place yesterday by Lufthansa technicians.  ""There were no irregular aspects with the airplane, of course we have to analyse the [plane's] history ... at the moment it's important we do not indulge in speculation,"" he said.  Mr Winkelmann said the captain had more than 10 years' experience and had clocked more than 6,000 hours piloting Airbus planes.  Airplane security expert Michel Nesterenko told France 24 that both Lufthansa and its Germanwings subsidiary have ""impeccable"" safety records.  German chancellor Angela Merkel offered her sympathies to the passengers' families.  ""This is a time and hour of great sorrow and grief,"" she told reporters.  ""We feel uncertain about the precise cause of the accident. Any speculation on the cause of the accident is not relevant.""  She said the German foreign office had established a taskforce to handle the situation, and she would travel to the crash site tomorrow.  Mr Winkelmann said he believed that 67 German nationals were on the flight.  Among those were believed to be 16 German schoolchildren, according to the mayor of a Spanish town that hosted them as exchange students.  ""There were 16 children and two teachers who had spent a week here. The children were aged about 15,"" said Marti Pujol, mayor of the village of Llinars de Valles near Barcelona.  He said the group left to catch the flight on Tuesday morning.  Investigators head to accident site  Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said debris from the plane had already been found, was heading to the scene with Mr Valls and French accident investigators.  A crisis cell has been set up by authorities in Le Vernet, located in the Blanche valley between the towns of Digne-les-Bains and Barcelonette.  Seven police and civil security helicopters have been deployed to the area, where an emergency flight control centre has been established to organise the heavy air traffic to and from the crash site, according to a source close to the operation.  Around 360 emergency fire fighters in surrounding regions have been sent to the area to assist local forces.  Incoming snowfall and strong winds are forecast for the region, posing a challenge to the recovery effort.  France 24 journalist John Maguire told the ABC he expected recovery would be difficult.  ""It is going to be extremely difficult because it's the Alps, the villages are in small valleys and the plane looks as if it's come down against the mountains,"" he said.  The German government said it would also send air safety experts and its transport minister Alexander Dobrindt to the site.  In July 2000, an Air France Concorde crashed shortly after take-off from Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport en route for New York, leaving 113 people, mainly Germans, dead and eventually leading to the supersonic airliner being taken out of service.  France's leading air traffic controller union SNCTA called off a strike planned from Wednesday to Friday after news of the crash.

E739,0,Teen Murdered After Tracking Stolen Smartphone,"An 18-year old was shot and killed in London, Ontario over the weekend, after confronting three people he believed stole his smartphone. He had used an online tracking tool to locate the missing device.  Jeremy Cook lost his phone in a taxi, and traced its whereabouts to a strip mall in the local area, using an unnamed smartphone tracking system. Accompanied by another person, he approached a parked car. There are no details about what happened between next, but as the car started to drive away, Cook grabbed the door handle, and was shot multiple times.  The car was later found by police crashed and abandoned, and Cook’s phone was also discovered nearby. Reports say Cook had not been in trouble with the police before, and didn’t know the three people in the car, all of whom are still at large.  Police are taking the opportunity to tell people that while tracking lost phones is a useful tool to have, if the situation appears dangerous or threatening, it’s time to call them in. Constable Ken Steeves of the London police told CTVNews, “The app is not what makes the scenario dangerous, it’s the people you interact with. Our advice is if there is any indication of violence, or potential violence, just give us a call and we’ll attend.”  An analyst for IDC Canada said the amount of personal data we store on our smartphones, and the level of emotional attachment it can produce, may cause people “to not be as cautious as authorities might wish us to be.” Most of the time, however, services such as Find My iPhone are used to locate a lost phone, without any interaction with another person at all.  Cook’s friend Kasia Szymanski said Cook’s death was “senseless and cruel,” adding, “And over what, a phone?”  Editors' Recommendations"

politifact9802,0,Rand Paul: We Must Demilitarize the Police,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.  If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.  The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.  The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.  Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:  Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.  The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:  Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?  Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”  How did this happen?  Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.  There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.  Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.  This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”  Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”  Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”  When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.  Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.  This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.  Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.  The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.  Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.  Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.  Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.  Sign up for Inside TIME.

pheme_10,0,"Uber intros surge pricing during Sydney hostage siege, then backtracks after user outcry","This post was updated at 10:45 p.m. ET to include an updated statement from Uber.  Uber briefly charged its users in downtown Sydney a minimum $100 to escape an armed hostage crisis, a result of automatic surge pricing meant to get more drivers online.  An executive in the city's Central Business District (CBD) sent Mashable screenshots of the Uber app that showed the company was charging up to four-times the normal rate because ""demand is off the charts.""  Price surging was implemented in Sydney, Australia on Dec. 15th, 2014, during a hostage siege in the CBD. Image: Mashable  ""I have never, ever seen it at four-times [the normal rate] and I'm a 1% top Uber user,"" said Matthew Leung, the user in contact with Mashable. ""I understand the way the business works — higher the demand, higher the charge — but four-times at $100 minimum is ridiculous. Almost price gouging at its worst.""  Another customer shared a screenshot of their ""wack"" fare estimate that showed a trip from an area just blocks from the siege to the airport would cost $145-185. That journey would normally cost less than $100, according to Uber's website. ""This is price surging,"" he wrote in a comment to Mashable.  After Mashable published a story on the price hikes, the company reversed course and announced that all riders in the area would be free, and that anybody who had been charged the higher amount would be refunded.  ""We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,"" Uber spokesperson Katie Curran told Mashable in a statement. ""Uber Sydney will be providing free rides out of the CBD to help Sydneysiders get home safely.""  Image: Uber  Any riders who were charged the higher amount may email supportsydney@uber.com to get their refund, she said, adding that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area.  Uber, the company said, will now pick up the tab.  Uber Sydney's Twitter account tweeted the info.  Uber rides out of the CBD today are free for all riders to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm for more info. — Uber Sydney (@Uber_Sydney) December 15, 2014  The crisis involves at least one hostage taker and about 13 hostages, all being held in a cafe in downtown Sydney, Australia.  At present, little is known about the assailant, other than the fact that an Islamic flag was shown in the cafe window, leading some to suspect that the incident may be a terrorist attack. Police have evacuated most of the area.  Following the police evacuation, many locals have reported difficulty in finding transportation as they attempt to exit the area.  Uber CEO Travis Kalanick had previously said the company's pricing algorithms will be ""capped"" during situations like what's unfolding in downtown Sydney. ""For each market, the state of emergency price will be set after excluding the 3 highest-priced, non-emergency days of the preceding 2 months,"" he said, adding that the policy ""intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters.""  Last July, New York's attorney general announced that Uber agreed to put a cap on prices during “abnormal disruptions of the market,” meaning natural disasters and emergencies, to comply with the state's price gouging regulations. It isn't clear if a similar agreement is in effect in Australia.  Uber launched in Australia in Oct. 2012.  Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report."
E514,0,"Oregon cat is world's oldest at 26 years, 13 days: Guinness","(Reuters) - An Oregon cat with a fondness for sharp cheddar and catching mice has become the oldest pet feline in the world at 26 years and 13 days, Guinness World Records officials said on Thursday.  Corduroy lives in the rural community of Sisters, Oregon, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Portland, and spends plenty of time outside, the organization said in a statement.  Since kittenhood, Corduroy has lived with owner Ashley Reed Okura, who was only seven years old when the cat entered her life, Guinness officials said.  ""The secret has been allowing him to be a cat - hunting and getting plenty of love,"" Reed Okura said in a statement.  Aside from chasing mice, the cat also likes to eat cheddar cheese, according to Guinness officials.  The previous record-holder was a San Diego feline named Tiffany Two, who was 26 years and 204 days old when she died on June 3, the officials said.  Kristen Ott, a spokeswoman for Guinness World Records, acknowledged that an older cat than Corduroy might be out there. To hold the record, an owner must submit evidence such as video recordings of a pet feline throughout the decades, as well as witness statements.

E536,0,Teeming Tower of Pizza,"Claim: A photograph depicts a real (giant) pizza, part of a challenge in which intrepid diners can win $1,000.  TRUE  Example: [Collected via e-mail, August 2015]  I’ve seen this image floating around Facebook for a few days. Haven’t been able to find the name of the pizza place featured in it. The pizza looks to be about 4ft square which means that each of the 9 customers would only have to eat the equivalent of about 1.75 14 inch pizzas in 2 hours, which seems pretty easy for a ninth of a $1000 prize. I’m skeptical so I was wondering if your experts could hunt down some facts on the matter.  Origins: In August 2015, the above-displayed image (of an exceptionally large, Sicilian-style pizza) and a caption vaguely describing a pizza challenge was circulated on social media sites. According to rumors, the upfront cost for participating in the contest (purportedly $218) was steep, but participants were eligible for a refund and a $1,000 bonus if they consumed the entire pizza within a given timeframe (two hours, according to the meme).  The pizza depicted is indeed a real menu item offered at Big Mama’s and Papa’s Pizzeria, a Southern California pizza chain. A small graphic displayed on the chain’s web site alludes to the pizza challenge, as well as a prize of “up to $1,000”:  However, that linked image leads only to a “coming soon” message which offers no information about the pizza challenge or its stipulations. We reached out to Big Mama’s and Papa’s Pizzeria’s corporate offices to determine whether circulating claims about the pizza challenge were true, and according the company the pizza challenge as described in the meme is mostly accurate. Of the twenty Big Mama’s and Papa’s Pizzeria locations in Southern California, they said, five currently possessed the capability to serve the giant Sicilian pie, and the challenge was most commonly undertaken at their Burbank location.  Big Mama’s and Papa’s Pizzeria said that participating locations generally require 48 hours notice to prepare for the challenge. As the meme states, a challenge group consisting of eight (not nine) people has two hours to eat the entire pizza (which consists of approximately 200 slices, measures 54″ by 54″, and weighs about 50 lbs). The pizza must have at least one topping and costs about $235, a price that is refunded should the participants successfully consume the entire pizza.  The chain added that while three to four teams generally attempt the pizza challenge each month, and so far only two contestant teams had managed to successfully complete the challenge and earn the $1,000 prize.  An episode of Wreckless Eating showed a team attempting to complete the challenge:"
TM1582,0,"Tiger Woods pays $750 million in divorce settlement, report says","Tiger Woods has agreed to pay his wife Elin Nordegren $750 million in a divorce settlement, claims the London Sun.  And he still might have gotten a bargain.  In exchange, says the U.K. tabloid, Nordegren agrees to never speak publicly about Tiger’s extramarital affairs or pen any tell-all books with titles like “In the Rough — My Life With a Serial Cheater,” or “A Hole In One (Side of His Head) — How I Declawed a Cheatin’ Tiger.” She can’t even talk or write about him after he dies, according to the agreement.  The Sun reported Wednesday that Woods and Nordegren, following intensive negotiations and a thorough review of his mountains of financial assets, will sign divorce papers next week during a court hearing in Orlando, Fla.  The deal gives Nordegren between $750 and $833 million, the newspaper said, and full physical custody of the couple’s children, 3-year-old daughter Sam and 1-year-old son Charlie. The couple will share legal custody of the children.  Woods will be able to visit the children for up to half of each week, but not if he’s in the company of any women who, for example, list the “Las Vegas Kitty Club” as their permanent address. Actually, according to the Sun, he can’t be in the company of any woman around the kids unless he’s married or engaged to her.  “Elin is desperate to protect the children from the womanizing side of their father,” a friend of Nordegren’s told the Sun. “Tiger’s main fear is her telling her story after he’s rebuilt his reputation, sending him back to the gutter.”"
E167,0,"Fox News Suggests Obamacare Enrollment Numbers Aren't Real, Cites Anonymous ""Independent Expert""","Fox News cited an unnamed “independent expert” to cast doubt on the veracity of recent Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers, which have exceeded 16 million Americans and are reported to have driven the largest reduction in uninsured persons in 40 years.  On March 16, the Obama administration announced that 16.4 million Americans had enrolled in insurance through the health care law since it took effect. As The New York Times reported “Since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013, the officials said, the proportion of adults lacking insurance has dropped to 13.2 percent, from 20.3 percent.”  But at Fox News, high enrollment numbers and a plummeting rate in those uninsured was barely mentioned. According to a Media Matters count, the network mentioned the 16.4 million Americans who enrolled in health insurance just once in the days following the announcement in an attempt to discredit the findings. On the March 16 edition of Special Report with Bret Baier, host Bret Baier briefly reported on the enrollment numbers, offering the unevidenced claim that “an independent expert says the reality is fewer than 10 million people have signed up.”  Fox has consistently downplayed and twisted Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers, going as far as to skew on-air graphics to misleadingly suggest less Americans were signing up for insurance through the health care law than had been originally projected.  UPDATE: The Associated Press reported that the government's numbers differed from those of “an independent expert,” who concluded only about 9.7 million people gained insurance. The lower number was based on a survey by Dan Witters, research director for the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, who “took into account insurance losses” during some of the years the ACA was in effect."
E591,0,Five Holistic Doctors Dead,"In mid-July 2015, a number of articles on the subject of recently deceased alternative health practitioners began to circulate on social media. One of those (articles (“5 Holistic Health Doctors Found Dead In 4 Weeks, 5 More Go Missing — After Run-Ins with Feds”) appeared to have inspired several other similar articles, but the claims they made were mostly congruent.  The web site HealthNutNews published one of the first iterations, offering a list of recently deceased physicians, chiropractors, and osteopaths:  June 19th, 2015 – Dr Bradstreet … was found with a gunshot wound to his chest in a river. The small town locals ruled the death almost immediately as a suicide; but many have their doubts. This same day in Mexico … three doctors were traveling to the State Capital in Mexico, to deliver some papers. They were reported missing that day.  This portion of the article referenced one of the five “holistic health doctors” who was found dead, as well as three nameless doctors who went “missing” in Mexico in circumstances seemingly related to each another only by date. No information was provided about what readers were supposed to infer from this information. The deceased doctor to whom the author referred was James Jeffrey Bradstreet, a controversial figure found dead of a gunshot wound in a river in June 2015. Bradstreet, 61, was subject to a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raid shortly before his death, which police said appeared to be suicide.  As for the missing Mexican doctors, a 9 July 2015 article in the Daily Beast profiled their case and gave no indication that the individuals affected were in any way affiliated with alternative medicine or were on the radar of the FDA. In fact, there are no clear parallels between the deceased “holistic health doctors” included in the conspiracy theory and the missing Mexican doctors that we could find.  Another portion of the article stated:  June 21st, 2015 — Father’s Day: We have two dead chiropractors, Dr. Holt [33] and Dr. Hedendal [67] (both reported to be fathers), in Florida; both found on the East Coast, both were presumably healthy, and both were described as very fit. We still have no cause of death listed in the articles we can find on either one.  A definitive cause of death for Hedendal has indeed been difficult to turn up, but Florida television station WBBH cited “natural causes” as a possibility. (Hedendal was 67 at the time of his death.) Comments on an online obituary for Hedendal included remarks (#41) from an individual named Rudy Vlaardingerbroek, who noted that:  I knew Bruce well for almost twenty years. I enjoyed chatting with him and throwing the discus. On Father’s Day he was at the Sunshine State Games and felt dizzy throwing the discus and even fell once. He just didn’t look good acc. to other throwers, although his last throw was 133. He was given water and Gatorade, went to his car and passed away sitting there. He must have died of severe hydration, which may have led to a heart attack. We will surely miss him.  As for Holt, his cause of death was indeed not readily available in searches (which have now been crowded out by conspiracy theory ramblings). An article on his death published in Raleigh News & Observer reported that that information was still pending:  [Holt’s] unexpected death last month while on a trip to Jacksonville, Fla. has been a blow to his family and the community he’d created through his work. Though he had been struggling with recent health issues, none were thought to be life threatening by loved ones. His family is awaiting the results from an autopsy report<.  We found no indication that Hedendal or Holt had experienced run-ins with the FDA (as had Bradstreet) in recent months.  The next portion of the original article stated:  June 26th, 2015 — Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick MD goes missing. He was traveling from North Dakota, to neighboring Montana (which he did often as his son lived there), and his truck and trailer were found on the side of the road. The search has expanded, but authorities say it’s like he vanished without a trace. He’s 6′ tall, and described as Irish-looking, with a goatee; and details can be found on the links.  Actually, Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick of Bismarck, North Dakota was last seen on 2 July 2015. Dr. Fitzpatrick did not seem a likely candidate for a massive big pharma hit job, nor was he an “alternative health” practitioner of any description. Articles published about his disappearance described him as a retired ophthalmologist known for forays into nature preserves, who’d grown increasingly frail in recent years:  [Lieutenant Arlyn Greydanus] says the 74-year-old suffers from medical conditions that require medicine and could suffer from confusion. He also struggles with walking great distances and walks slowly, but is believed to have possibly gotten a ride from the area where his car was abandoned. “From where the vehicle is stuck there are many different directions he could go. He’s actually stuck in what’s called a pea field. It’s very difficult to walk through that that field was searched extensively by helicopter and you would have been able to see if someone walked through there. There’s a two-track road that he drove in on and possibly walked out on,” Lt. Greydanus said.  The article continued with the following:  June 29th, 2015 — The beloved holistic Theresa Sievers MD was found murdered in her home. Jeffrey Whiteside MD a pulmonologist went missing, vanishing when he simply “walked away.” Dr. Whiteside, known for his successful treatment of lung cancer, disappeared in Door County, Wisconsin, while vacationing with family. They say he was on foot, and had no vehicle; and numerous reports call it “mysterious,” saying he too, vanished without a trace.  On 29 June 2015, Theresa Sievers was bludgeoned to death in her Florida home. An investigation into Sievers’ murder remains open, and law enforcement officials have declined to comment on what they’ve found so far. But again, we were unable to turn up any evidence suggesting Sievers had an adversarial relationship with the FDA or any other large, powerful public health agencies before she was brutally murdered, and whoever killed her left a remarkable amount of evidence (incongruent with a calculated corporate hit).  On 28 February 2016, 47-year-old Mark Sievers (Dr. Sievers’ spouse) was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in what police alleged was a for-hire plot to cash in on several life-insurance policies.  Another entry read:  July 10th, 2015 — Lisa Riley DO (Doctor of Osteopathic medicine) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head.  Lisa M. Riley, 34, was indeed a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and not an MD, but her field of practice was listed as the decidedly uncontroversial “emergency medicine.” If Dr. Riley had cause to murderously enrage the medical establishment, that cause was well hidden.  It’s true that Riley’s death occurred under exceptionally suspicious circumstances. She was found dead of a gunshot wound by her husband in her home on 10 July 2015, and ten days later the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) announced that Riley’s husband, Yathomas Riley, would be charged in connection with her death:  The Americus Office of the GBI is announcing the issuance of arrest warrants for Yathomas Riley in the death of his wife, Dr. Lisa Riley. A Lee County magistrate judge issued warrants today charging Riley with Murder, Felony Murder and Aggravated Assault in the death of Dr. Riley. The charges stem from an investigation initiated by GBI agents and the Lee County Sheriff’s Office when her body was reported discovered by Yathomas Riley at their Northampton Road residence in Leesburg on July 10, 2015. Riley has remained in custody at the Lee County Jail since his arrest on July 10, 2015 for charges unrelated to his wife’s death. The extensive investigation into the matter is still ongoing.  Yathomas Riley was implicated in a similar situation in 2010 involving his then-girlfriend Koketia King. That woman was shot in the head as well, and Riley claimed the wound was self-inflicted. King survived.  Later articles also tied the death of Dr. Ronald Schwartz, 65, to the conspiracy. Schwartz was found shot to death in his Jupiter, Florida, home on 19 July 2015, but the deceased was neither an alternative health practitioner nor embroiled in any controversy at the time of his apparent murder. Schwartz, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was licensed in Tennessee and Georgia (not Florida) and believed to be functionally retired from medicine. His neighbors described him as quiet and reclusive.  So while Bradstreet died of an apparently self-inflicted wound under increasing FDA heat (and following a recent raid), none of the other doctors subsequently tacked on to conspiracies regarding his death led similar lives. Of the four missing doctors, one was elderly and retired, and three vanished in Mexico (where they lived and worked). Dr. Holt’s passing was a shock to many, but autopsy results are pending. Dr. Hedendal was 67 and passed away after a day of strenuous physical activity (presumably of natural causes). The murder of Dr. Sievers remains unsolved but was unlikely to have been carried out by high-level hitmen. Dr. Riley’s husband (implicated in a similar shooting in 2010) was charged in connection with her suspicious death.  Update: On 28 August 2015, police in Missouri arrested two men in connection with the murder of Dr. Sievers. The arrests were announced in a press conference that day; Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott said that two “vicious killers are in custody,” but declined to elaborate with respect to the circumstances of the murders:  Two men were jailed in Missouri in connection with the slaying of Bonita Springs doctor Teresa Sievers, and one of the suspects is an old friend of her husband, Mark Sievers. Curtis Wayne Wright Jr., 47, and Jimmy Rodgers, 25, face second-degree murder charges. Wright, who goes by his middle name, Wayne, has been friends with Mark Sievers since their high school days in Hillsboro, Missouri, according to mutual friends. Scott would not answer questions from reporters, saying the case was active and ongoing. He did not reveal the cause of death, manner of death or a possible motive, but he did say the case was the “most complicated, intricate set of circumstances that most of us have ever seen.”  those who deeply distrust medicine and science might take the list’s assertions as plausible, but under the slightest scrutiny its claims disintegrate. Given the breadth of fields in which these individuals practiced (e.g., chiropracty, obstetrics, ophthalmology), millions of Americans could conceivably be counted among their ranks. Even if all the deaths and disappearances were suspicious (which most of them appeared not to be), five people out of millions is a very small percentage. The claims were not unlike the “Clinton Body Count” rumor, by which every dead person who had the slightest link to the Clintons was drafted into a broad, vague conspiracy theory. This rumor (like its predecessor) cherry-picked information that fit its narrative (such as timeframe) while discarding the facts that didn’t fit (such as mainstream area of practice or later-explained circumstances/arrests).  Update: On 23 July 2015 the web site Freedom Outpost published an article titled “Two More Doctors Found Dead — That Makes 7 in a Month,” and on 24 July 2015 the Free Thought Project web site published an article titled “Another Florida Doctor Murdered, Bringing Total to 8 Dead & 5 Missing in Just the Last Month.”  The former claimed that the July 2015 murder of Dr. Amanda Crews (along with four other individuals) was one of the “latest” suspicious doctor deaths (Crews was not a holistic doctor and practiced general family medicine). Dr. Crews (along with her two children, another child, and her partner’s mother) was found dead on 18 July 2015. However, Crews’ former romantic partner was identified almost immediately as a suspect:  Martin Martinez, 30, has been formally charged with killing his girlfriend’s 2-year-old toddler last October. He was also a suspect in the Saturday homicides of girlfriend Dr. Amanda Crews, their 6-month-old daughter, her 6-year-old daughter, his mother and an unidentified 5-year-old girl. All of the deaths occurred in the homes Martinez shared with Crews, 38. Police haven’t disclosed the cause of death for the five people killed in Modesto or discussed possible motives. Martinez isn’t charged with their deaths, but police say he’s their prime suspect.  A lengthy profile published in People magazine about Dr. Crews’ life and career detailed the circumstances of her family life and provided additional details about her death.  Freedom Outpost‘s article readily admitted that Dr. Crews (who, again, was not a “holistic doctor”) was likely murdered by a romantic partner in an act of domestic violence. The site explained that the multiple murders were likely unrelated to any other doctors’ deaths, even after insinuating that doctors were being targeted and killed in a wide-ranging conspiracy:  Are these doctors’ deaths all related somehow? The Crews death does seem strangely off, especially considering there is a suspect in custody and that he is also suspected of killing a child in October 2014. Other than that, it seems that doctors are facing a high rate of deaths, eerily similar to bankers in the past couple of years.  The Free Thought Project also cited the July 2015 death of Dr. Norm Castellano, a Tampa-area dentist, among the list of “mysterious” doctor deaths. Castellano (again, not a “holistic doctor”) died on 13 July 2015, and multiple Facebook posts published by grieving friends and patients indicated that his cause of death (while not publicly disclosed) was in no way suspicious or unexplained.  That web site also referenced the 21 July 2015 death of Dr. Nicholas J. Gonzalez. (While the article’s title suggested a cluster of doctor deaths occurred in Florida, Gonzalez was based and died in New York.) Gonzalez was an alternative medicine practitioner, but the circumstances under which he died (as described on his web site) were not suspicious:  It is with great sadness that the office of Nicholas J. Gonzalez, M.D. relays news of his untimely death on Tuesday, July 21, 2015. The cause of death was cardiac related, it appears, as he suddenly collapsed and was unable to be revived. Dr. Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected.  The rumor (currently attached to a number of separate and ostensibly unrelated tragedies) continued to suggest imaginary or tenuous links to support an assertion that the deaths were somehow connected. While headlines crowed about deaths in Florida, several of the doctors died in other states and had no obvious link to that state. Moreover, the claims centered upon the purported targeting of alternative medicine doctors despite the fact that several of the individuals included were mainstream, science-based medical providers. As the rumor spread, the inclusion of mainstream doctors across several states highlighted that the death of any doctor in July 2015 was likely to be conscripted into the (still unarticulated) conspiracy, whether or not that doctor lived in Florida or practiced alternative medicine.  (Some sources have attempted to link all the deceased doctors together through the common thread of their advocacy of Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor, or GcMAF, a protein that a handful of doctors have claimed can cure anything from cancer to autism by boosting the human immune system. However, only Dr. Bradstreet has been connected to its use.)  As of March 2015, there was an estimated range of 897,000 to just over 1,000,000 doctors in the United States, and per every 100,000 people (of all vocations) each year, approximately 821 die. Going by those numbers alone, between 6,500 and 8,200 medical doctors will statistically die of myriad causes in any given year. Each month approximately 700 doctors would die (based upon the number of American doctors and the number of overall deaths), thirteen of whom could be expected to live in Florida before accounting for rate fluctuations based on whether a state (like Florida) is exceptionally populous. As such, six to eight deaths is well within the realm of expected doctor deaths."

Evans, who was celebrating his 25th birthday, landed on his head and shoulder following the vicious hit from Jets center Mark Scheifele with 57 seconds remaining in Game 1 of their second-round playoff series. Evans did not have an opportunity to brace for impact because Scheifele arrived as the Montreal center was scoring to seal the 5-3 win. Afterwards, Montreal interim coach Dominique Ducharme called the hit 'vicious' and 'useless,' and said Evans had not yet been taken to a hospital. 'No, he's still here, he's being evaluated,' Ducharme said. 'He's doing better, but before I came here he was still being evaluated.' Ducharme told reporters later that Evans was not required to go to the hospital, but did say he expects Evans to be out of the lineup. 'He's certainly going to miss time, we're not sure how much time,' Ducharme said, as quoted by Sportsnet's Eric Engels. The incident unfolded moments after Winnipeg pulled goaltender Connor Hellebuyck in exchange for an extra attacker while trailing Montreal, 4-3, late in the third period. After the Canadiens cleared their zone, Evans chased down the puck behind Winnipeg's net at the opposite end of the ice, circled tightly back around the netting and scored. Unfortunately, in the excitement, Evans didn't notice that Scheifele was waiting for him at that exact same moment. Scheifele was given a major for charging and a game misconduct.He is facing a disciplinary hearing and could receive a five-game suspension. 'It was a dirty hit, but the league's going to take care of it,' Canadiens defenseman Joel Edmundson said. 'If he gets back in the series, we're going to make his life miserable, but I think the league's going to do a good job with that.'"
politifact7668,0,Statement by the President,"Rose Garden  5:35 P.M. EDT  MR. BARDEN: Hello. My name is Mark Barden. Just four months ago, my wife Jackie and I lost our son, and our children, James and Natalie, they lost their little brother Daniel. Daniel was a first-grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our sweet, 7-year-old Daniel was one of 20 children, six adults lost on December 14th. I have to say it feels like it was just yesterday.  In our deepest grief, we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of America, from every corner of the country.  What happened in Newtown can happen anywhere. In any instant, any dad in America could be in my shoes. No one should feel the pain. No one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people who’ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.  And that's why we're here. Two weeks ago, 12 of us from Newtown came to meet with U.S. senators and have a conversation about how to bring common-sense solutions to the issues of gun violence. We came with a sense of hope, optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many Americans. We met with dozens of Democrats and Republicans and shared with them pictures of our children, our spouses, our parents who lost their lives on December 14th.  Expanded background checks wouldn't have saved our loved ones, but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators, both with “A” ratings from the NRA -- a common-sense proposal supported by 90 percent of Americans. It‘s a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.  We'll return home now, disappointed but not defeated. We return home with the determination that change will happen -- maybe not today, but it will happen. It will happen soon. We've always known this would be a long road, and we don't have the luxury of turning back. We will keep moving forward and build public support for common-sense solutions in the areas of mental health, school safety, and gun safety.  We take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost, and we carry a great faith in the American people.  On behalf of the Sandy Hook Promise, I would like to thank President Obama, Vice President Biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer America. I would like to thank Senators Toomey, Manchin, Schumer and Kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.  And I would like to thank Connecticut’s Senators Blumenthal and Murphy. They’ve been right with us. They stood by us right from the very beginning. From the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us.  We will not be defeated. We are not defeated, and we will not be defeated. We are here now; we will always be here because we have no other choice. We are not going away. And every day, as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence, our determination grows stronger.  We leave Washington hoping that others, both here and across the country, will join us in making the Sandy Hook Promise, a pledge that we'd had great hope that more U.S. senators would take literally. I'd like to end by repeating the words with which the Sandy Hook Promise begins: Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.  Thank you. It is now my great pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.  THE PRESIDENT: A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies -- including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who’s here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers –- this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence.  Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders –- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children. And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn’t worth it. They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery.  By now, it’s well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We’re talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law.  And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea. But it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea.  A majority of senators voted “yes” to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward.  I’m going to speak plainly and honestly about what’s happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -– both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with “A” grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights.  As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system.  Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- she’s a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks.  In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn’t contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That’s why 90 percent of the American people supported it.  But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of “big brother” gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn’t matter.  And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators. And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and they’re all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other.  But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn’t want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this. It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment.  And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote “no.”  One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn’t prevent all future massacres. And that’s true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just two days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try.  And this legislation met that test. And too many senators failed theirs.  I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn’t make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent?  I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. ""A prop,"" somebody called them. “Emotional blackmail,” some outlet said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don’t have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?  So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington.  But this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don’t give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We’re going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We’re going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We’re going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.  But we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters.  To all the people who supported this legislation -- law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are -- you need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time.  To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn’t represent your views on this one.  The point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate, and as organized, and as vocal as those who blocked these common-sense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They’ve been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives.  So to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you’ve got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence.  And that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they’ve doing over the last several weeks, last several months.  And I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We’re going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about we needed change something after Tucson.  And I’m assuming that the emotions that we’ve all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we’ve all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago -- the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who’ve lost a loved one to gun violence -- I’m assuming that's not a temporary thing. I’m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.  I believe we’re going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people.  Thank you very much, everybody.  END 5:55 P.M. EDT"

politifact9438,0,"Everything you need to know about the drone debate, in one FAQ","This is well outside Wonkblog’s normal bailiwick, but if nothing else, Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) filibuster against CIA director nominee John Brennan — launched as a protest against the administration’s drone policy, which Brennan has steered for the past four years — uncovered a hunger for a broader conversation on the topic. So what does the drone program actually entail, and why are Paul and others criticizing it?  What is a drone?  Technically called “unmanned aerial vehicles” (UAVs), drones are just aircraft without human pilots onboard, encompassing everything from reconnaissance vehicles to unmanned crop dusters. In common parlance, though, “drone” has come to refer to unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), which are UAVs equipped with combat capabilities, most commonly the ability to launch missiles.  How long has the U.S. government been using them?  The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, the most famous UCAV in the U.S. arsenal, first saw combat in 1995 as part of the NATO intervention in Bosnia, but at that time was solely a reconnaissance tool and carried no payload. On Feb. 16, 2001, the Predator #3034 became the first to be successfully fitted with a Hellfire missile, and to fire it in a trial flight. Predators were deployed to Afghanistan almost immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and on Oct. 7, 2001 they conducted their first armed mission there.  In addition to the Predator, the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a larger UCAV capable of carrying a higher payload, has seen service starting in 2007. The current program is jointly administered by the CIA and the Joint Special Operation Command (JSOC).  Where do we send them?  Primarily Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. According to a Washington Post database, compiled with the help of the New America Foundation and Long War Journal, strikes in Pakistan have been occurring since 2004 and picked up in pace starting in summer 2008. Apart from a November 2002 strike in Yemen, the Somalia and Yemen campaigns began in 2011. There have been reports of strikes in the Philippines, though information there is sketchy.  Additionally, drones have seen service in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Unites States’s more traditional military campaigns in those countries.  How powerful is a drone attack?  Predator drones can carry up to two Hellfire missiles. Those have warheads of about 20 pounds, which are designed to pierce tank armor; their damage outside of the vehicle targeted is limited. An alternative warhead, which manufacturer Lockheed Martin touts as featuring “high lethality and minimum collateral damage,” also is in service.  Reapers are another story. They feature a maximum payload of 3,000 pounds, or 1.5 tons. That means they can carry a combination of Hellfires and larger 500 pound bombs like the GBU-12 Paveway II and GBD-38 JDAM. Those have an “effective casualty radius” of about 200 feet. That means that about 50 percent of people within 200 feet of the blast site will die. Those odds improve — or worsen, depending on how you look at it — the closer you get, obviously.  So imagine if you took a football field and shrunk it by a third. A Reaper attacks one endzone with a GBU-12. If you’re on the field, you have a 50 percent chance of dying. Update: I apparently forgot the distinction between yards and feet since middle school. Corrected.  How many drone attacks have we launched to date?  According to the Post database, there have been 347 in Pakistan, 53 in Yemen and 2 in Somalia. From 2008 through October 2012, there were 1,015 strikes in Afghanistan, 48 in Iraq, and at least 105 in Libya according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. That does not include strikes in Libya past September 2011, strikes from 2001 to 2007 in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those since October 2012. The New York Times’ Mark Mazzetti reported that at least one strike has happened in the Philippines.  What sort of people have we targeted?  Primarily al-Qaeda and its affiliates. That includes al-Shaabab in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (which works in Yemen), and the Haqqani Network in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Philippines strike was intended to kill Umar Patek, a leader of the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah who helped orchestrate the 2002 attacks in Bali that killed 95 people. Patek is now serving a 20-year sentence in Indonesia.  Have we killed U.S. citizens this way?  We’ve killed four, at least. Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born al-Qaeda operative in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in 2011, as was his American-born 17-year-old son (in a subsequent strike) and Samir Khan, a North Carolina native who died in the same strike as the elder al-Alaki. Ahmed Hijazi, also an American citizen based in Yemen, was killed in 2002. Note: paragraph updated to correct spelling of al-Awlaki’s name and include Hijazi.  To clarify the Obama administration’s exact policy on killing Americans without a trial, Eric Holder wrote the following letter to Sen. Rand Paul: “Dear Senator Paul: It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: ‘Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?’ The answer to that question is no.” The dispatch followed an earlier, more equivocal note from Holder on the subject, which seemed to indicate Holder believes the president has the authority to kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if he judges them a threat.  How many people have died in drone attacks?  Sen. Lindsey Graham estimated the death toll of the Pakistan/Somalia/Yemen program at 4,700. That’s higher than most estimates; Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations puts the number at closer to 3,500.  How many of those were civilians?  Cora Currier at ProPublica helpfully compiled a number of estimates in January. New America puts the civilian death total in Pakistan and Yemen between 276 and 368, of which 118-135 were under the Bush administration. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number between 446 and 978, increasing to 993 if you include Somalia. Of those, 179 to 209 were children, BIJ estimates. A Stanford/NYU study suggests that the strikes have inflicted considerable psychological trauma on residents of Pakistan, and deterred relief workers from serving areas targeted. Funerals and rescue workers have been targeted in past strikes.  What’s the process for deciding when and where to launch them?  As my colleague Greg Miller has reported, the administration uses something called the “disposition matrix” to determine targets for drone strikes. Miller describes it as a “single, continually evolving database in which biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations are all cataloged. So are strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols…The database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an operational menu that spells out each agency’s role in case a suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot.”  The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) will prepare lists of potential targets, which will be reviewed every three months by a panel of intelligence analysts and military officials. They are then passed along to a panel at the National Security Council, currently helmed by CIA director nominee Brennan, and then to Obama for final approval. The criteria for addition to the list are determined personally by Obama, who also must personally approve all strikes outside Pakistan. Pakistan strikes are approved by the CIA director.  What’s the case for using drones?  There’s some political science to suggest that “decapitation strikes,” like these drone attacks, are actually quite effective at reducing the ability of terrorist groups to operate effectively. The RAND Corporation’s Patrick Johnston and UCLA’s Anoop Sarbahi have found preliminary evidence that the drone program specifically is effective at degrading the operations of targeted groups. Zack Beauchamp has a good overview of this literature here.  But that’s a case for strikes, not for drone strikes specifically. There is, however, substantial evidence that the percentage of casualties borne by civilians is much lower with drone strikes than with just about any other kind of military intervention, even if one accepts high estimates of the percent of killed who are civilians.  Is Congress kept in the loop?  To some degree. As part of Brennan’s confirmation process, Senate Intelligence Committee members were granted access to Justice Department memos justifying the use of drones, and a similar white paper was shared last year. The Committee and its House counterpart are also allowed to review individual strikes, including the intelligence behind them and video obtained during their commission. But they have not tried to limit the program in any way. ”I don’t know that we’ve ever seen anything that we thought was inappropriate,” one Congressional aide told the Los Angeles Times.  How about the courts?  Nope. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has proposed establishing a specialized court to approve drone strikes based on FISA courts that approve surveillance of suspected foreign intelligence in the U.S., but that is, for now, just an idea. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Obama, has called for an oversight board placed within the executive branch.  Is this legal?  The Justice Department certainly thinks so, though the reasons why are classified, and lawsuits to expose them have proven unsuccessful. The clearest window we’ve gotten into their reasoning as relates to the killing of U.S. citizenscomes from a white paper leaked to NBC News last month. It derives the authority for the strikes from the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed in the wake of 9/11, which grants the government broad powers against al-Qaeda. What’s more, the white paper argues that drone strikes somehow don’t run afoul of Executive Order 12333, the ban on assassinations as a tool of policy that has existed since the Ford administration, as they are used for “self-defense.” See also Brennan’s speech here defending the program more broadly.  Administration critics aren’t impressed, with the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffeer noting the white paper, “argues that the government has the right to carry out the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen.”  Does it violate international law?  The Justice Department memo cites the UN Charter, which allows states to make war in the interest of self-defense, an interest also invoked by Brennan. Critics, like UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns, say that this defense is a stretch, and the killings plainly run afoul of the laws of war and international human rights treaties.  Are other countries using drones this way?  Only the United States and the United Kingdom (which assists in the Pakistan drone effort) currently use drones in combat, but many other countries have acquired drone technology, including China, Russia, India, Iran and Israel. The U.K. uses Reapers and Predators while most other countries use the Israeli Aerospace Industries Heron or similar Israeli models. Drones saw combat use in Israel during the Gaza war of late 2008. Even Hezbollah has acquired reconnaissance drones. All told, the GAO estimates that 76 countries, at least, have drone technology.  What do our allies think about it?  European allies other than Britain generally refrain from using drones to attack al-Qaeda, but frequently share intelligence that assists the drone program in selecting targets.  What about the countries where we send drones? What do they think?  They’re very mad. The Pakistani government has condemned the drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty, though there’s evidence they’re tacitly allowing the strikes to happen. The Yemeni government quietly agreed to the strikes, though murmurs of opposition have emerged of late. Citizens in both countries deplore the campaigns.  Is it actually weakening al-Qaeda?  New America estimates that 1,967 – 3,236 militants were killed in Pakistan and Yemen, meaning the overwhelming majority of casualties were intended targets. That said, the share of deaths who were “high-profile targets” was 11 percent under Obama and 33 percent under Bush according to New America. And there are deeper doubts as to whether the strategy is recruiting more militants than it kills, by turning local populations against the United States. The attempted Times Square bomber, for instance, cited drones as a motivating force.  It could also be a bad idea even if it is weakening al-Qaeda. Many have noted that the money spent on anti-terrorism efforts might save more lives if devoted to tackling more mundane threats, like auto accidents.

The gunman was known to Australian law enforcement authorities.  The self-styled Sheikh was an Iranian refugee who was facing charges including being an accessory to murder and sexual assault.  The siege began at 10am local time when Monis entered the cafe in Martin Place carrying a pump-action shotgun.

Footage showed Monis apparently using one hostage as a human shield.  Monis operated a website which was taken down shortly after he was named as the hostage-taker in the media.  In a letter on the site, which he signed Sheikh Haron, he accused the US, Britain and Australia of ""oppression and terrorism"" alongside images of dead children."
E512,0,"Student Protests Parking Tickets by Paying Fine With 11,000 Pennies","Stephen Coyle said he disagrees with what the money is used for.   -- When Stephen Coyle got two parking tickets in June on campus at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, he flirted with the idea of paying the $110 in fines with pennies.  But when the 26-year-old student discovered how the money collected through fines is used, he said he resolved to turn that idea into a form a protest, by way of 11,000 pennies.  ""I started digging deeper of what the money was used for and 80 percent is redistributed to other schools instead of keeping it on campus,"" Coyle told ABC News. ""That's what upset me, which led to paying with the pennies.""  ""I understand why the citations were there, so that wasn't the issue,"" he said. ""We have a beautiful campus, but there's some severely neglected buildings. Lecture halls have missing seats, ceiling tiles are missing -- some of that money can be reinvested into the buildings.""  Prior to paying his tickets, Coyle said he found the following information, which the university lists on the parking services section of its website.  ""According to North Carolina law, the University is only allowed to retain 20% of the money collected from parking citations. The remaining 80% must be remitted to the state to support local public schools (elementary, middle and high schools). The 20% that UNC Charlotte is allowed to keep is earmarked to cover operating costs for parking enforcement,"" according to the website.  In order to raise awareness, Coyle said, he went to three local banks and got $110 worth of pennies -- 11,000 coins in total.  ""There were 25 dollars in each box and 50 rolls,"" he added. ""I brought the pennies in loose -- in three separate buckets.""  Coyle said he emailed a supervisor in parking and transportation services at UNCC to explain why he'd be paying his fine with coins.  ""She gave me some opposition as far as me paying in pennies, saying I had to count them in front of her,"" Coyle said. ""I argued that I've never been in a situation where I had to pay for something and count the money myself. I told her I would do my best to ensure the accuracy, but in the end it was their responsibility, not mine. I was really nice about it.""  Because pennies are legal currency, the office had to accept them, said Coyle, who was then able to make an appointment to pay his bill.  It took two of the office's employees three hours and 40 minutes to count the coins, Coyle said.  ""I apologized immediately when I gave them the change, saying it was a part of the protest I was doing,"" Coyle said. ""They were fine with it. The only person that seemed pretty upset was their manager.""  The university released the following statement to ABC News.  ""Regarding the student who paid his traffic fines in pennies, our understanding is that he paid in pennies to symbolize his dissatisfaction with a North Carolina constitutional mandate. That mandate requires that most of the money from such fines be remitted to the Office of State Budget Management to support public schools, rather than used on campus. The University appreciates the student’s interest and initiative in learning more about the functioning of government.""  In the long run, Coyle said he'd like to have the state statute overturned so that every school will be able to keep their fines and reinvest in their own student body.  He added that he's been approached by a number of UNCC students and alumni who are willing to participate in his ""Let Them Count"" protest, which he's been promoting on a community Facebook page."
pheme_183,0,The Art Newspaper,"Swiss museum accepts Gurlitt's problematic bequest  Kunstmuseum Bern could face years of litigation from heirs claiming looted works  By Julia Michalska and Javier Pes. Web only  Published online: 24 November 2014    Kunstmuseum Bern The trustees of the Kunstmuseum Bern announced today, 24 November, that the museum would accept the bequest of the art collection of Cornelius Gurlitt, who died in May at the age of 81. Since the collection is believed to contain looted works and could open the Swiss museum up to years of litigation, the institution has taken the full six months allowed by German probate law to make the decision about whether to accept or reject the gift. At a press conference held in Berlin, the chairman of the board of trustees of the Bern museum, announced “we take joint responsibility” for the collection with the Bavarian authorities and the Federal Government of Germany. Works that are believed to have been looted will stay in Germany while a team of researchers investigates their provenance, according to the press statement. See also: • ‘The Gurlitt collection should be sold to benefit Jewish organisations’  The collection, which comprises around 1,300 works by artists including Picasso, Chagall and Renoir, has been mired in controversy. The hoard was discovered in Gurlitt’s Munich apartment in 2012 during a routine tax investigation. More works were unearthed at Gurlitt’s house in Salzburg. The majority of the collection is believed to have been amassed by Gurlitt’s father, the Nazi-era art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt. He told US authorities after the war that his collection had been destroyed in Allied bombing.    The president of the Jewish World Congress, Ronald Lauder, warned the Bern museum in a Spiegel interview in November that accepting the bequest would “trigger an avalanche of lawsuits”.    Last week Uta Werner, a cousin of Cornelius Gurlitt, announced that she had submitted a claim in a Munich probate court to the hoard on behalf of the Gurlitt family.    The Bern museum also announced today that it was setting up a provenance research department. It pledged to make a priority responding to loan requests from German museums that owned works that the Nazi's deemed “degenerate"" and so purged from the nation's public collections.

pheme_31,0,Soldier and gunman killed in Ottawa shootings,"A gunman armed with a rifle has shot and killed a Canadian soldier guarding Ottawa’s war memorial, before being pursued by police into the national parliament building and shot dead himself.  The attack began at about 9.50am on Wednesday local time (13.50 GMT) when the man shot and killed the uniformed soldier, Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo. It was reported by Canadian media that the suspect then stole a car and drove to nearby Parliament Hill.  He was then confronted by police and killed. Video obtained by Canada’s Globe and Mail showed officers moving through parliament before an exchange of gunfire is heard. A body was reported lying on the ground after the gunfire.  Canadian local authorities confirmed the name of the dead gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who was first identified by the US television network CBS. The 32-year-old suspect was deemed a “high-risk traveler” by intelligence services, and according to media reports he had recently had his passport confiscated.  No information has as yet been given as to a possible motive for the attack.  This kind of terrorist attack did not seem possible. Jim Munson, a Canadian senator    In a television address, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper condemned the “brutal and violent” incident, adding that it was a reminder that “Canada is not immune to terrorist attacks.”  “Canada will never be intimidated,” he said.  Harper was holding a meeting with party members in the centre block as the gunfire erupted.  “PM was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,” said Tony Clement, a member of the treasury board.  Another witness, Marc-Andre Viau, told the AFP news agency that he saw a man run into a meeting inside parliament, chased by police who yelled “take cover”. That was followed by up to 20 gunshots.  People fled parliament by scrambling down scaffolding being used in renovations, witnesses told the Canadian Press news agency.  Police had by this point sealed the area and were combing buildings for more gunmen, with unconfirmed reports they were positioned on roofs. Police said the investigation was active but no one else had been found.  Gunfire was also reported at the nearby Rideau shopping centre, but police later said there was no such incident.  Speaking to Al Jazeera from parliament at 11.30am local time (15.30 GMT), as police continued to hunt for suspects, Senator Jim Munson told how his offices had been placed “in lockdown”.  “People are quite shaken. This kind of terrorist attack did not seem possible,” he said.  Parliament was still sealed by police at 5:00 local time (21:00GMT), according to Al Jazeera’s Jet Belgraver, who is reporting from Ottawa.  “When we arrived the streets were rather empty especially around the parliament buildings,” she said. “As we approached, the parliament buildings were cordoned off. But the scenario right now in Ottawa seemed to have calmed a little bit.”  Hospital officials told the Reuters news agency that they had received three patients – two suspects and the soldier. One of the suspects and the soldier were confirmed dead by police at about 1pm local time.  The attack came hours after Canada raised its terrorism threat level from low to medium, the highest it has been for four years.  It also comes two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over – and one of them killed – in Quebec.  Harper warned that the “facts are still being gathered” and said he condemned the “despicable act”."
pheme_52,0,Sydney Siege Ends: Police Storm Cafe Where Man Haron Monis Held Hostages,"A gunman was killed and two hostages are dead after police stormed a chocolate shop in Sydney on Monday, ending a 16-hour siege by a self-professed sheik.  An intelligence source named the gunman as Man Haron Monis, who is also known as Sheikh Haron. He appeared to be making demands to negotiators through Facebook, YouTube and local news media.  In addition to the gunman, two hostages — a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman — suffered fatal injuries, police said. They were pronounced dead at a hospital, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said during an early morning news conference. Four others, including a police officer, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were transported to the hospital.  Police stormed the chocolate shop after gunfire erupted early Tuesday morning local time (around 10 a.m. ET Monday.) Flashes of light could be seen coming from inside the cafe and glass had blown out onto the street.  Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014  At least five of the 17 hostages escaped at that time. Another five had escaped hours earlier.  Scipione said police decided to enter the shop “as a result of gunfire inside the premises.” He said they believed that more lives would have been lost if police didn’t enter when they did but, he added, “until we were involved in this emergency action, we believe that no one had been injured.”  About 20 minutes after the building was stormed, a bomb-disposal robot was seen outside the entrance. No explosive devices were found, Scipione, adding that the incident was isolated. ""Do not let this sort of incident bring about any sort of loss of confidence about working and visiting in our city,"" he said.  The drama began shortly after 9:45 a.m. local time (5:45 p.m. ET Sunday). A black flag used by Islamist groups in the Middle East had been shown in the window of the Lindt cafe.  Monis is described as a ""cleric and activist"" on a website in his name, which also likens him to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He had been convicted of penning offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers slain during the war in Afghanistan.  Will Geddes, a hostage negotiator and founder of International Corporate Protection, told NBC News the decision to storm the building would not have been taken lightly. ""They would only move in like that if there was some serious threat to those inside,"" he said. ""This had been going on for more than 16 hours, and in situations where you have a lone wolf there is the risk that the suspect can become very fatigued and volatile.""  Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was ""claiming political motivation."" Police said they were ""operating according to our counter-terrorism protocols,"" and ex-FBI agent Don Borelli told TODAY that the suspect appeared to be inspired by ISIS.  Man Haron Monis arrived at a court in Sydney, Australia, on April 18, 2011. DEAN LEWINS / EPA, file  Speaking before the site was stormed, New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said ""the very best negotiators in the world"" were trying to end the standoff.  Asked about reports that hostages were being forced to use Facebook and YouTube to pass on the gunman’s demands, Scipione said: “There's no place on earth that doesn't have access to social media. Our plans are built around that.”  Scipione said reports of bomb threats in other parts of Sydney had been investigated but they not did not appear to be legitimate.  Chris Reason, a journalist with NBC News' Australian partner Channel 7, said the hostage-taker had forced victims to ""stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time."" He added that the suspect seemed to be ""getting extremely agitated"" after the first five hostages left.  Nearby streets and office buildings were cleared and police were seen using ladders to rescue bystanders — including babies — from the building’s other floors. The U.S. Consulate in Sydney was evacuated and all U.S. personnel had been accounted for, the State Department told NBC News.  The Lindt Chocolate Cafe is in Martin Place, a busy tourist, transportation and shopping district home to several major banks — including the Reserve Bank of Australia — as well as the state Parliament. The nearby Sydney Opera House cancelled Monday night's performances.  The flag shown in the cafe's window as the hostage drama unfolded appeared to be the Tawhid Banner. NBC News terrorism analyst Evan Kohlmann, added that it was frequently used by Jabhat Al-Nusra and other armed Islamist groups in the region — but not ISIS.  The suspected gunman inside the Lindt cafe in Sydney, Australia, on Monday. Channel Seven / AFP - Getty Images  Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, the highest Islamic office holder in Australia, said in a statement that the Muslim community was ""devastated"" by the incident, adding that ""such actions are denounced in part and in whole in Islam.""  The hostage incident comes after police carried out a series of major anti-terrorism raids throughout Sydney in September. ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani has also urged Muslims in Australia to carry out ""lone-wolf"" attacks against civilians, according to terrorism analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group.  NBC News' Andrea Mitchell, Marc Smith, Matthew Grimson and Jason Cumming and Reuters contributed to this report."
pheme_185,0,"Police storm Sydney cafe to end hostage siege, three dead","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Heavily armed Australian police stormed a Sydney cafe early on Tuesday morning and freed a number of hostages being held there at gunpoint, in a dramatic end to a 16-hour siege in which three people including the attacker were killed.  Police have not publicly identified the gunman but a police source named him as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian refugee and self-styled sheikh known for sending hate mail to the families of Australian troops killed in Afghanistan. He was charged last year with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife.  Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman was well known to authorities and had a history of extremism and mental instability.  During the siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney’s central business district, hostages had been forced to display an Islamic flag, igniting fears of a jihadist attack in the heart of the country’s biggest city.  Around 2 a.m. local time (10.00 a.m. ET on Monday), at least six people believed to have been held captive managed to flee after gunshots were heard coming from the cafe.  Police then moved in, with heavy gunfire and blasts from stun grenades echoing from the building.  “They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn’t enter there would have been many more lives lost,” said Andrew Scipione, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales.  An investigation would determine whether hostages were killed by the gunman or died in cross-fire, Scipione told reporters just before dawn.  Police said a 50-year-old man, believed to be the attacker, was killed. Television pictures showed he appeared to have been armed with a sawn-off shotgun.  A man aged 34 and a 38-year-old woman were also killed, police said. The man was the cafe manager and the woman was a mother and barrister, local media reported. Four were wounded, including a policeman hit in the face with shotgun pellets.  Medics tried to resuscitate at least one person after the raid and took away several wounded people on gurneys, said a Reuters witness at the scene. Bomb squad members moved in to search for explosives, but none were found.  So far 17 hostages have been accounted for, including at least five others who were released or escaped on Monday.  “To the people of Sydney, this was an isolated incident ... Do not let this sort of incident bring about any loss of confidence of working or visiting our city,” said Scipione.  On Tuesday morning, the area near the cafe remained cordoned off, with bystanders and passing office workers leaving flowers under police tape. Flags flew at half mast across the city.  Leaders from around the world had expressed their concern over the siege, including Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada, which suffered an attack on its parliament by a suspected jihadist sympathizer in October.  NO LINKS TO TERROR GROUPS  Monis was found guilty in 2012 of sending offensive and threatening letters to families of eight Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, as a protest against Australia’s involvement in the conflict, according to local media reports. Monis was also facing more than 40 charges of sexual assault.  Slideshow ( 32 images )  “He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,” Abbott told reporters in Canberra. The prime minister did not identify the gunman.  A U.S. security official said the U.S. government was being advised by Australia that there was no sign at this stage that the gunman was connected to known terrorist organizations.  Although the hostage taker was known to the authorities, security experts said preventing attacks by people acting alone could be difficult.  “We are entering a new phase of terrorism that is far more dangerous and more difficult to defeat than al Qaeda ever was,” said Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin, speaking in New York.  Slideshow ( 32 images )  ON ALERT  Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its escalating action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, has been on high alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East or their supporters.  News footage showed hostages in the cafe holding up a black and white flag displaying the Shahada, a testament to the faith of Muslims. The flag has been popular among Sunni Islamist militant groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.  The incident forced the evacuation of nearby buildings and sent shockwaves around a country where many people were turning their attention to the Christmas holiday after earlier security scares.  In September, anti-terrorism police said they had thwarted an imminent threat to behead a random member of the public and days later, a teenager in the city of Melbourne was shot dead after attacking two anti-terrorism officers with a knife.  The siege cafe is in Martin Place, a pedestrian strip popular with workers on a lunch break, which was revealed as a potential location for the thwarted beheading.  Muslim leaders urged calm. The Australian National Imams Council condemned “this criminal act unequivocally” in a joint statement with the Grand Mufti of Australia.  The security operation was the biggest in Sydney since a bombing at the Hilton Hotel killed two people in 1978."
E518,0,Planned Parenthood’s Goddess Kali Lights Up Empire State Building,"Recently an elaborate lights show, “Projecting Change,” was beamed onto the south side of the Empire State Building in New York City to raise awareness about wildlife extinction.  Louie Psihoyos (Oceanic Preservation Society) partnered with Travis Threlkel (Obscura Digital) to portray colorful images of birds, snakes, and land and sea animals over a space of 33 floors, roughly 365 by 185 feet in dimension using 40 stacked 20,000-lumen projectors. Psihoyos and Threlkel, who began collaborating together four years ago.  Most peculiar was their choice to conclude their show with an image personifying death: the Hindu goddess (or devil) of death, Kali. While some refer to her as the goddess of time and destruction, in Sanskrit Kali means, “she who is black” or “she who is death.”  The show highlighted the reality of death in New York City, where more Black babies are murdered than are born. Black babies are not as fortunate as the snow leopard, snake, or bird whose images were projected across 33 floors of the Empire State Building.  Black New Yorkers didn’t receive $33 million in funding to protect their survival and weren’t even on the “Black Lives Matter” campaign’s radar. (In fact, the very organizations claiming to aid minorities, including blacks, under the guise of “health” programs, are primarily committed to advancing eugenics-based population control among the poorest communities worldwide– in order to reduce them.)  Disturbing as the plight of chained elephants is, nothing is more disturbing than the U.S. government legalizing and funding half of an organization’s $1 billion budget to dismember living human beings.  Even if genocide of Black Americans was not a serious issue, of all the folklore to choose from to represent wildlife preservation, they chose a goddess who specifically personifies death.  Several traditions describe Kali:  She was born out of anger, after which “the black goddess went wild and ate all the demons she came across, stringing their heads on a chain which she wore around her neck. It seemed impossible to calm Kali’s bloody attacks…”  Her blackness symbolizes “eternal darkness that has the potential to both destroy and create.”  She was created to battle the demon Raktabija (Blood Seed). After attaining “all the divine weapons of the gods, Kali swiftly sought out Raktabija and his demons and proceeded to swallow them all whole.” Kali killed Raktabija by chopping his head off with a sword and drinking all of his blood.  Kali specifically wears “a necklace of heads, [a] skirt of arms, [a] lolling tongue, and brandish[es] a knife dripping with blood.”  She is the perfect choice to remind New Yorkers of whose heads Planned Parenthood is decapitating.  Like Kali, Planned Parenthood’s knives drip with blood from the tissue and parts of babies’ feet, hands, livers, eyes, skin, and other organs — in exchange for $23 million in “financial donations.” (Fetal liver cell prices, for example, range from $488 to $24,250.)  Rather than wield a sword to chop off heads, Planned Parenthood suctions off heads of living babies, after they have writhed in excruciating pain—feeling, even attempting to move away from, and avoid their limbs being ripped from their body.  Instead of stringing babies’ heads on a chain to wear around their necks or wearing a skirt made of babies’ arms, Planned Parenthood employees prefer “financial compensation,” like a Lamborghini.  Like Kali, Planned Parenthood was born out of and continues to foster anger and division. It’s roots date to the early 20th century Negro Project designed “to breed out of the race the scourges of transmissible disease, mental defect, poverty, lawlessness, crime … since these classes would be decreasing in number instead of breeding like weeds.”  Like Kali, Planned Parenthood’s bloody attacks appear to be endless. Kali could not have been a better choice to represent what is overwhelmingly and deliberately occurring in New York City—and in every city in America—black genocide.  Blacks are the only minority in America whose population is steadily declining—not because of police brutality, or violence, but solely because black babies are being chopped up while they are still alive. Then they are sold to the highest bidder. Does this sound familiar?"

This comes after a decision on Wednesday from a federal judge ordering the county clerk, Kim Davis, to start issuing marriage licenses, after she initially refused to do so, the Times notes. The paper says that Davis didn't show up at work on Thursday.  NPR's Debbie Elliott tells our Newscast unit that Davis has stopped issuing marriage licenses citing religious objections, but that ""U.S. District Judge David Bunning ruled her religious beliefs don't excuse her from performing her government duties.""  Davis, who is located in Rowan County, Ky., has stopped issuing marriage licenses, whether to same-sex or straight couples, Debbie says.  She is appealing the judge's decision, according to Matt Staver of Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit organization advocating for religious freedom.  ""You can't just simply ignore religious convictions. That's why we have the first amendment,"" he says.  The Associated Press notes that in Kentucky, a county clerk issues the marriage license while ""someone else must 'solemnize' the marriage. Then the license can be filed with the county clerk.""  David Ermold, the AP says, was denied a license to marry his partner of 17 years. ""I will say that people are cruel, they are cruel, these people are cruel,"" Ermold said. ""This is how gay people are treated in this country. This is what it's like. This is how it feels.""  The AP reports that Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear has told Davis that she needs to issue marriage licenses or resign.  Debbie adds that in other states, like Alabama, some probate judges have stopped giving out marriage licenses instead of following the Supreme Court ruling. That means people may have to travel outside of their county to get find a judge issuing licenses."
pheme_261,0,Bern museum accepts controversial art hoard,"Bern's Museum of Fine Arts has accepted the controversial Gurlitt art collection Keystone  This content was published on November 24, 2014 - 07:30  swissinfo.ch and agencies      The Museum of Fine Arts in Bern has said it will accept contentious works of art, stashed away until recently by Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of one of Hitler’s art dealers. Gurlitt died in May and in his will named the museum sole heir to his collection.  Germany will continue to carry out provenance research on the 1,200 paintings, drawings and sketches and will cover any legal costs should the museum face claims from the heirs of Jewish families that fled the Nazis.  ""This was not an easy decision,"" Christoph Schäublin, head of the museum's foundation board, told a news conference in Berlin. He added that there was no feeling of ""triumph"" at the museum ""given the history that weighs heavily on the collection"".      Schäublin said that a challenge to the bequest by one of Gurlitt's cousins did not affect the museums decision to take the art works. The museum will make public many of Gurlitt's business correspondences in the interests of transparency.  The collection – whose value has been put at hundreds of millions of francs – is currently being kept in Berlin. So far already a third of the content has been identified as confiscated from its rightful owners.  German Culture Minister Monika Grütters told the news conference that the provenance of 240 art works remains unclear.  While the bequest in May was a surprise, the museum’s decision on Monday was not. Indeed, many news agencies reported the decision on Friday, citing “reliable sources”, although without confirmation from either the Bern museum or the German culture ministry.  'Das Klavierspiel' by Carl Spitzweg is among the looted art works that will be handed back to its rightful heirs. dpa-pa  The museum’s board of trustees had wanted time to weigh up the legal ramifications and moral implications of a gift that could potentially unleash hundreds of claims from descendants of Nazi victims who want their art back.  The Bern museum will be bound by the Washington Principles on Nazi-confiscated ArtExternal link, a code of ethics signed by 44 countries in 1998, including Switzerland, that calls for the active restitution of Nazi-looted art.  World headlines  The extraordinary story – which has highlighted the challenges of dealing with Nazi-looted art – began in 2010, when German pensioner Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of one of Hitler’s official art dealers, was randomly stopped on a train from Switzerland and found to be carrying thousands of euros.  The German authorities, suspecting he was a tax dodger, entered his flat and were stunned to find it full of masterpieces by artists such as Picasso, Renoir and Matisse whose value has been estimated at several hundred million francs.  When the discovery was made public in 2013, it made headlines around the world – especially when it was announced after Gurlitt’s death, that Bern’s Museum of Fine Art stood to inherit the entire collection.

Australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages early Tuesday, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, New South Wales police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione told reporters.  Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died, according to Scipione. They were later identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Other people were injured, including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets. All were described by police to be in stable condition.  ""Understandably, there is a lot of speculation, but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Tuesday.  Man Haron Monis.  What did the gunman want? Why did he choose the cafe as his target?  ""There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee, and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident,"" Abbott said.  He offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones.  ""These events do demonstrate that even a country as free as open as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence,"" the Prime Minister said.

According to his social media posts, the hostage-taker appears to have embraced a radical Sunni theology.  Abbott told reporters that the gunman was already well-known to authorities, and that he had a ""long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability.""  Before the raid, Monis had demanded a flag and phone call with Abbott, CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported. He made the demands through hostages who contacted media organizations, Sky News reported.  Some hostages had also reportedly posted messages to social networking sites and the YouTube online video service. Police urged media early Tuesday not to show the videos.  Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, pleaded guilty in 2013 to writing letters to relatives of Australian service members saying they were ""Hitler's soldiers,"" according to Australian media reports.

pheme_246,0,Gunman Linked to Charlie Hebdo Shooters Takes Hostages at Kosher Grocery,"The suspected shooter of a female cop in a Paris suburb is now also suspected of attacking a kosher grocery store. The New York Times reports that the shooter has taken five hostages and killed two at Hyper Casher in eastern Paris near the Porte de Vincennes.  The suspect, a man named Amedy Coulibaly, is reportedly in the same terrorist cell as the two Charlie Hebdo shooters currently suspected of holding a hostage in a factory northeast of Paris near Charles de Gaulle airport. There, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi have reportedly told negotiators they intend to “die as martyrs.”  Coulibaly and a woman, Hayat Boumeddiene, are both wanted in connection with the fatal shooting of a police office in the suburb of Montrouge on Thursday, according to a statement from law enforcement officials.  On Friday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told reporters that the incidents were connected and that the shooter had communicated with the Kouachi brothers — suggesting that Wednesday’s attack might be part of a bigger plan. “The latest advances in the investigation allows us to establish a connection” between the two incidents, Valls said on Friday afternoon, while he was meeting the grief-sticken staff members of Charlie Hebdo, at the offices of the French daily newspaper Libération.  A third suspect in the Charlie Hebdo attack, Mourad Hamyd, has already surrendered. The two hostage situations remain ongoing as French law enforcement officials reportedly work toward resolution.

pheme_170,0,Hostage taking in Sydney cafe sparks fears of Islamist-linked attack,"Australian police locked down the center of the country's biggest city on Monday after an armed man walked into a busy downtown Sydney cafe, took hostages and forced them to display an Islamic flag, igniting fears of a jihadist attack. Police said they knew of one armed assailant involved in the incident at the Lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of Sydney's financial district, but there could be more. Police, including paramilitary officers, cordoned off several blocks around the cafe as negotiators tried to defuse one of the biggest security scares in Australia for decades. Snipers and a SWAT team took up positions around the cafe and police helicopters flew overhead. At least five hostages have been released or escaped since the mid-morning siege began, with terrified cafe workers and customers seen running into the arms of paramilitary police. Read MoreAustralia raises terror threat level to 'high'  About 15 hostages could still be seen inside the cafe, said Chris Reason, a reporter at Channel Seven, whose office is opposite the cafe. ""From inside Martin Place newsroom we can see gunman is rotating hostages, forcing them to stand against windows, sometimes 2 hours at a time,"" Reason said on Twitter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has warned of militant plans to strike Australian targets, said there were indications the hostage-taking was politically motivated. ""This is a very disturbing incident. I can understand the concerns and anxieties of the Australian people,"" Abbott told reporters in Canberra.  Police close a street where a cafe is being used to hold hostages in the central business district of Sydney on December 15, 2014. Peter Parks | AFP | Getty Images  Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its escalating action against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, is on high alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East. ""We have moved to a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist event,"" Andrew Scipione, police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, told reporters, declining to comment on a possible motive, the number of assailants or hostages. News footage showed hostages holding up a black and white flag displaying the Shahada - a testament to the faith of Muslims. The flag has been popular among Sunni Islamist militant groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda. The incident forced the evacuation of nearby buildings and sent shockwaves around a country where many people were turning their attention to the Christmas holiday following earlier security scares.

In September, anti-terrorism police said they had thwarted an imminent threat to behead a random member of the public and days later, a teenager in the city of Melbourne was shot dead after attacking two anti-terrorism officers with a knife. The siege cafe is in Martin Place, a pedestrian strip popular with workers on a lunch break, which was revealed as a potential location for the thwarted beheading. ""We're possibly looking at a lone wolf who has sympathies to global jihad or someone with mental health issues in search of a cause,"" said Adam Dolnik, a professor at the University of Wollongong who has trained Sydney police in hostage negotiations. ""This is all about attention.""  Scores of armed police surrounded the cafe after the siege began around 9:45 a.m. (22:45 GMT on Sunday). The area is home to the Reserve Bank of Australia, commercial banks and close to the New South Wales state parliament. ""I walked up to the door and then everyone was sitting down and the door's locked which is pretty weird because it's never locked and there was one guy walking around with a hat and a beard,"" a man who identified himself as Bruno, a worker at the cafe, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp, referring to the suspected assailant. He said he then turned away. Grainy images of the suspected assailant showed what appeared to be a middle-aged man wearing a headband and a white shirt. The Reserve Bank of Australia said staff had been locked down inside the building and were all safe.

pheme_191,0,"Ottawa shooting: A day of chaos leaves soldier, gunman dead","Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.  The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton.  Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.  It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.  CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.  He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.  In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.  ""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.  ""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the suspected gunman in Wednesday's Ottawa shootings, had a criminal record in B.C. and Quebec. (Twitter)  Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.  Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.  Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.  Caught 'by surprise'  In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""  ""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.  Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.  Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.  Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.  Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.  Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""  Chaos and bravery inside Parliament  Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.  Cpl.

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.  In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:  NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

pheme_0,0,Locked out pilot tried to 'bash down cockpit door' before Germanwings flight crashed,"One of the pilots of the Germanwings Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps on Tuesday was locked outside the cockpit and tried to bash the door down, investigators have said.  As investigators ponder why the plane with 150 people on board plunged for eight minutes before slamming into a mountain in mostly clear skies, evidence gathered from the flight recorder indicates one pilot was not in the cockpit at the time of the cash, according to the New York Times.  The battered cockpit voice recorder recovered from the crash site of Germanwings Flight 9525.  A senior military official working with the investigation suggested there was a ""very smooth, very cool"" discussion between the two pilots in the early stages of the flight as it travelled from Barcelona in Spain to Dusseldorf in Germany.  Audio from the black box flight recorder suggests that one of the pilots exited the cockpit during the flight but was never able to get back in despite apparently bashing on the door.  ""The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer,"" the investigator said.  Read more: Photos released of battered black box in Germanwings Airbus 320 crash  ""And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer.  ""You can hear he is trying to smash the door down.""  The startling news has shed some light on the mystery surrounding the plane's rapid decent but it has also thrown up more questions.  Investigators have ""no idea"" why the pilot left the cockpit said the official, who spoke to the newspaper anonymously as the investigation is ongoing.  ""But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door,"" the official said.  The initial data gathered from the Airbus A320 suggests its descent from about 38,000 feet occurred gradually over a 10-minute period which indicates the jet was not significantly damaged.  In Pictures: Families in tatters over Germanwings tragedy  At no point during the descent did the plane issue a distress call or set-off any emergency warnings to ground control.  France's Bureau of Investigation, charged with investigating the crash that occurred on a mountainside northeast of Nice, has declined to comment.  The bureau's spokeswoman Martine de Bono said investigators were continuing to analyse the plane’s flight recorder.

politifact6730,0,SECRET VIDEO: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters,"During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who don’t assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:  There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.  Romney went on: “[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”  Mother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser—where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public—and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and we’ve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.]  Here is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:  At the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, “Had he been born of Mexican parents, I’d have a better shot of winning this.” Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, “I have inherited nothing.” He remarked, “There is a perception, ‘Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.’ Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.”  Romney told the contributors that “women are open to supporting me,” but that “we are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we’re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.” When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, “Frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.” He added, “The fact that I’m either tied or close to the president…that’s very interesting.”  Asked why he wouldn’t go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:  We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you—the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side—they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, “Do you think Barack Obama is a failure?” they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, “Are you disappointed that his policies haven’t worked?” they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don’t want to be told that they were wrong, that he’s a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he’s corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn’t up to the task. They love the phrase that he’s “over his head.” But if we’re—but we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don’t agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he’d keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn’t been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can’t get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won’t graduate from high school. What’re they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, “Yeah, I think you’re right.” What he’s going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who’s been successful, or who’s, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.  (Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.)  To assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:  I have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didn’t realize it. These guys in the US—the Karl Rove equivalents—they do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I’d tell them to you, but I’d have to shoot you.  When one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasn’t attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:  Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don’t think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact…My dad used to say, “Being right early is not good in politics.” And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject—discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn’t win elections. And there are, there are, there are—for instance, this president won because of “hope and change.”  Romney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:  They’ll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I’m going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president’s going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets you’re talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. We’ll see capital come back and we’ll see—without actually doing anything—we’ll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I don’t know what will happen. I can—I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a “Taxageddon,” as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that can’t work together, it’s—it really is frightening.  Advertise on MotherJones.com  At the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney “sparingly…so that people don’t get tired of her.” And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance “has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.”  Here was Romney raw and unplugged—sort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don’t contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.

pheme_397,0,Sydney Hostage Siege Ends With Gunman and 2 Captives Dead as Police Storm Cafe,"Even so, it remained unclear whether Mr. Monis had any accomplices.  The armed man took control of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe on Martin Place in central Sydney around 9:45 a.m. Monday, trapping employees and customers inside. He had a black flag with white Arabic script, similar to those used by Islamic militants on other continents, which was later displayed in a cafe window.  During the day Monday, five people fled the cafe, including two employees, but it was not clear whether the assailant had allowed them to leave or they had escaped.  Auto and rail traffic was halted and nearby buildings like the New South Wales Parliament and the Reserve Bank were evacuated or locked down, and helicopters circled overhead. Police officials said they made contact with the hostage-taker and tried to negotiate an end to the siege.  Mr. Monis was known to the police. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, he was free on bail in two separate criminal cases. He was charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact in the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, and in April 2014, he was charged with the indecent and sexual assault of a woman in western Sydney in 2002. Forty more counts of indecent or sexual assault relating to six other women were later added in that case.  Mr. Monis pleaded guilty in 2013 to 12 charges related to the sending of poison-pen letters to the families of Australian servicemen who were killed overseas, local media reports said. He was reportedly sentenced to probation and community service."
E789,0,"No pay, no play! Poor kids banned from school carnival","No party for the poor.  PS 120 in Flushing held a carnival for its students Thursday, but kids whose parents did not pay $10 were forced to sit in the auditorium while their classmates had a blast.  Close to 900 kids went to the Queens schoolyard affair, with pre-K to fifth-grade classes taking turns, each spending 45 minutes outside. The kids enjoyed inflatable slides, a bouncing room and a twirly teacup ride. They devoured popcorn and flavored ices. DJs blasted party tunes.  But more than 100 disappointed kids were herded into the darkened auditorium to just sit or watch an old Disney movie while aides supervised — the music, shouts and laughter outside still audible.  The must-pay rule excluded some of the poorest kids at the elementary, where most parents are Chinese immigrant families crammed into apartments and “struggling to keep their heads above water,” staffers said.  “It’s breaking my heart that there are kids inside,” one teacher said.  The teacher hugged a 7-year-old girl who was “crying hysterically.”  “She was the only one from her class who couldn’t go, so she was very upset,” the teacher said.  The girl told others, “My mom doesn’t care about me.” But the teacher said parents possibly did not see or understand the flier that went home or didn’t have $10 to spare.  “Are we being punished?” one child asked an aide in the auditorium as kids sat there with no movie playing, a staffer said.  Principal Joan Monroe tacked up a list of the number of students per class: “How many attending, Paid,” and “How many not attending, Not paid.”  On Thursday morning, Monroe used the school loudspeaker to remind teachers to send in a list of kids who did not pay.  While teachers were handed a bag of little stuffed animals to give kids who paid for the carnival, one withheld them until she could add her own gifts for the half-dozen or so kids in her class who didn’t go.  “I think everybody should have gotten a prize, regardless,” she said. “They’re still part of our school community.”  The teacher hushed excited kids when they returned to class — some with bags of popcorn — after the carnival.  She had them put it away and do a quiet activity, so those who took part in the fun couldn’t talk about it and hurt those left out.  Another teacher was sickened by the inequity.  “If you are doing a carnival during school hours, it should be free,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s one kid or 200 sitting in the auditorium. They all should have been out there.”  Frank Chow, president of the parents association that sponsored the carnival, said Monroe insisted that kids whose parents didn’t pay could not partake.  “She was saying it’s not fair to the parents who paid,” Chow said. “You can’t argue much, I guess. The school is under her.”  The carnival cost about $6,200, including fees to a carnival company, Send In the Clowns, and reaped a $2,000 to $3,000 profit, he added.  “I wish we just charged parents the cost, not to make extra,” Chow said.  The profit is earmarked for the pre-K, kindergarten and fifth-grade moving-up parties, he said.  PS 120 families also have paid annual PA dues of $15 per family. That money will be spent on window air-conditioning units, Chow said.  Monroe did not return calls and an email from The Post."

pheme_36,0,"Gunman among 3 dead after police storm Sydney cafe, ending siege","Sixteen hours after a self-styled Muslim cleric took at least 17 hostages in a cafe in the heart of Sydney, armed police stormed the building, ending the crisis. Three people, including the gunman, were killed.  The dead hostages were a 38-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man, authorities said. Four people were injured, police told reporters Tuesday morning local time.  “This morning I come before you with the heaviest of hearts; unbelievably overnight we have lost some of our own,” New South Wales Premier Michael Baird said at the news conference. “We are shaken by a tragedy none of us could have imagined.”  Police said they believe that the gunman acted alone. He was widely reported to be Iranian-born Man Haron Monis, 50.  Advertisement  “This is an isolated incident,” Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said. “This should never destroy or change our way of life. This will not change the things that we hold dear in this country.”  In a separate appearance, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressed his thanks to police for their handling of the situation and offered sympathy to the victims.  “Our hearts go out to all of those caught in this appalling incident,” he said. “These events do demonstrate that even a country as free, as open, as generous, as safe as ours is vulnerable.”  The standoff paralyzed Australia’s largest city, as authorities closed off a portion of central Sydney after the siege began Monday morning local time. It was Tuesday morning before police made their move after hearing gunshots in the Lindt Chocolat Cafe.  “They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn’t enter, there would have been many more lives lost,” Scipione said.  “There was a number of gunshots that were heard, that caused them to move straight to what we call the ... emergency action plan and that caused them to enter,” he said.  There had been reports that the gunman had two bombs in the cafe and had planted two elsewhere, but Scipione said no explosive devices were found in the cafe.  He paid tribute to the courage of the police and also the hostages.  Advertisement  He said the officers involved “have saved many lives. Thank you that you’re there and prepared to do this, to put your life on the line to keep us safe.”  One officer was shot in the face in the incident but was doing well and is “grateful to be alive,” Scipione said.  Television caught images of the police assault, which began with a flurry of loud bangs, after which officers could be seen swooping into the cafe. Explosions could be heard shortly after six hostages emerged from the cafe, one of them being assisted by anti-terrorism forces. More were removed on gurneys a short time later as police stormed the building.  After the police moved in, one weeping woman was helped out by officers and at least two other people were wheeled out on stretchers.  Advertisement  Monis, widely identified by Australian media as the gunman, was an Iranian-born radical who claimed to be a Muslim sheik and has been charged in a series of violent crimes.  His former lawyer described him as disturbed, and said he was not acting in concert with any terrorist organization.  “This is a one-off, random individual. It’s not a concerted terrorism event or act. It’s a damaged-goods individual who’s done something outrageous,” the lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  “His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,” Conditsis said.  Advertisement  Monis arrived in Australia in 1996 as a refugee, and if he is implicated in the crime, it may inflame local sentiment against refugees arriving by boat, a hot-button issue in Australia.  Monis had been facing charges as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, and was also charged earlier this year with dozens of counts of sexual assault, allegedly carried out when he claimed to be a spiritual healer and was treating women. Haron was due in court in February to answer the charges.  Monis gained notoriety in Australia in recent years over a hate-mail campaign targeting the families of soldiers who died serving in Afghanistan, comparing their bodies to pigs.  He was charged and convicted for using the postal service to harass people. He appealed that conviction, claiming he was a peace activist whose rights to freedom of speech had been infringed.  Advertisement  Monis has repeatedly attacked Australian politicians, including Prime Minister Abbott, on social media, calling them racists and terrorists. He claimed that he was under constant attack by the authorities and had been investigated by the national intelligence agency.  He responded bitterly to recent comments by Abbott that migrants who moved to Australia should be willing to join “Team Australia.”  “Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of America and its allies including Australia,” Haron said on Facebook, before his page was taken down late Monday. He described his Facebook page as “Team Islam against Australian oppression and terrorism.”  Monis also posted a letter on his Facebook page attacking Abbott over Australia’s military involvement in Afghanistan, saying this had made the world -- and Australia -- more dangerous.  Advertisement  His website bears a photograph of a dead woman and three children, all bleeding, with the words: “This is an evidence for the terrorism of America and its allies including Australia. This result of their air strikes.”  Monis accused the “barbaric” Australians of torture and last week praised the Islamic State over its actions in Iraq and Syria.  Iran condemned the hostage-taking incident.  “Any terrorist action to tarnish the compassionate image of Islam is condemned,” Marziyeh Afkham, the spokeswoman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. A psychoanalysis of the suspect has been sent to Australian officials, she said.  Advertisement  The drama in Sydney began around 9:45 a.m. Monday in Martin Place, a plaza in the capital’s financial and shopping district. The area was packed with holiday shoppers as well as workers from nearby buildings taking a midmorning break.  The cafe is not far from courts, the parliament of New South Wales state, the U.S. Consulate and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Once the siege began, businesses and courts in the neighborhood were evacuated and closed for the day. The iconic Sydney Opera House, less than a mile away, also was evacuated.  Aside from the chop-chop sound of helicopters overhead, there was an eerie quiet, pierced with the sound of sirens. Surrounding streets were filled with police cars, ambulances and fire trucks.  Abbott confirmed late Monday local time that the gunman appeared to have “a political motivation,” and local media reported that the gunman was trying to obtain an Islamic State flag in exchange for some of the hostages.  Advertisement  Two people inside the cafe had been seen pressed up against the window holding a black flag with Arabic writing early in the siege. The flag appeared to say: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.”  As the day wore on, Australia’s Network Ten Eyewitness News reported that two female hostages in the cafe had phoned the station and spoken of two bombs planted in the cafe and two other bombs elsewhere in downtown Sydney. Police declined to confirm that.  “I can’t speculate on what may or may not be, and that would be very unhelpful at the moment,” Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said at an evening news conference. “At the moment we know that the person we are dealing with is armed.”  The women were “hysterical” and believed that their lives were in immediate danger, according to the network.  Advertisement  The hostages also conveyed the demands of the gunman, who called himself “The Brother,” according to the network: to speak to Abbott and to have an Islamic State flag delivered to the cafe. In return for the flag, one hostage would be freed, they reportedly said.  The network said on Twitter that police listened in to the network’s talks with the hostages, and “advised every step of the way.”  Burn declined to call the incident a terrorist act. “We still don’t know what the motivation might be,” she said, adding that authorities “want to resolve this peacefully.”  But authorities in New South Wales did call up the local counter terrorism unit, Task Force Pioneer.  Advertisement  “This is really about setting up command and control,” Burn said.  The attack came the same day police filed terror charges against two men, one accused of terror financing. Both had been arrested in Australia’s biggest series of terror raids in Sydney and Brisbane in September; one had been freed but was rearrested Monday. Police said there was no connection between the morning arrests and the siege, Fairfax media reported.  Booth, a special correspondent, reported from Sydney and Dixon from Kenya. Staff writers Michael Muskal and Lauren Raab in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

pheme_353,0,Two Suspects in 'Charlie Hebdo' Massacre 'Rob Gas Station' in Northern France,"Two of the alleged gunmen responsible for the worst terrorist attack in France in decades are feared to be heading back towards Paris after reportedly being seen in the north of the country amid a continuing manhunt.  Three gunmen murdered 12 people and wounded at least 11 others on Wednesday morning at the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine that had previously been threatened for mocking Islam. One of the attackers is in police custody after handing himself in.  Advertisement  According to Le Parisien, two of the heavily armed attackers were seen this morning in Aisne, near Villers-Cotteret in the Picardy region. They reportedly robbed a gas station for fuel and food, and according to the station manager then headed off in the direction of Paris.  Also today, a police woman was killed and a city employee was critically injured in a second shooting on Paris streets, but it is not yet known if the attacks are related.  On Wednesday, three black-hooded men armed with automatic weapons stormed the Charlie Hebdo headquartersin the center of the French capital at around 11:30am local time. They went on to kill 10 of the magazine's staff along with two police officers in a methodical and merciless attack that lasted just minutes.  The men then escaped in a black Citroen that was later found abandoned in Paris's 19th arrondissement — setting off a nationwide manhunt that led cops to Reims, a city 90 miles north of Paris. A terror raid was reportedly carried out Wednesday night by police forces at a site in the town, with reports indicating that at least three apartments were also searched in two separate Paris suburbs.  Police have identified the suspected attackers as Said Kouachi 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad.  The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that one of the suspects in the shooting turned himself in. The youngest of the three suspects, Mourad, walked into a police station in the town of Charleville-Mézières, some 142 miles northeast of Paris near the Belgium border, allowing police to take him into custody.  Advertisement  Anonymous sources reportedly told BFM TV News that he turned himself in after seeing his name on social media.  Police in France now appealing for information on the remaining suspects (Kouachi brothers) — David Clinch (@DavidClinchNews)January 8, 2015  Police hunted for the remaining suspects overnight. Reports indicated police conducted several raids across Paris and Reims. Early on Thursday morning the French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, confirmed that ""several arrests"" were made overnight in an interview with RTL Radio. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve added that ""seven people"" had been arrested in the raids so far.  It also emerged that Cherif Kouachi had previously been convicted of a terror charge in 2008, having helped funnel fighters from France to Iraqi insurgents. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Valls said there was ""no doubt"" the brothers were known to authorities and would have been under surveillance in the past.  Cazeneuve confirmed that one individual had been arrested and one suspect was on the run after the shooting. Police described the suspect as 175 centimeters tall with a shaved head by police, according to reports on France24.  Fusillade au sud de Paris: les deux blessés dans un état critique (source policière) — Agence France-Presse (@afpfr)January 8, 2015  An eyewitness to Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo, who asked to remain anonymous, told VICE News that she arrived in the area as the shooting started and while taking cover heard heavy gunfire lasting for around 10 minutes as well as what sounded like a rocket propelled grenade. Armed police quickly arrived at the scene and exchanged fire with the attackers.  Advertisement  Shortly after the shooting stopped, a man covered in blood exited the building, yelling, ""The bodies and the wounded are over there,"" she added. A 70-year-old woman who was playing with her granddaughters in a nearby park told VICE News that she heard shooting and saw civilians escaping the area on foot and by bicycle.  Security officials confirmed that the attack had been carried out by three gunmen. France 24 cited sources close to the investigation as saying the men had been armed with Kalashnikovs and a rocket launcher.  Police said the men shouted ""The Prophet is now avenged"" as they carried out the assault and Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said that witnesses reported the attackers had screamed ""Allahu Akbar!"" (""God is Great""). The same cry can be heard in unverified video footage apparently shot by onlookers. The men handled their weapons with apparent proficiency and operated with military-like precision.  Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Corinne Rey told the French weekly Humanité that the men identified themselves as al Qaeda and spoke perfect French. They entered the building by forcing Rey to open the door.  A video from the street outside captured by a witness showed the men approaching a wounded policeman then shooting him dead at point blank range as he held up his hands and pleaded.  French President François Hollande said the attack was ""undoubtedly"" an act of terrorism. Visiting the scene shortly after it had been secured, a visibly emotional Hollande spoke of an ""especially barbaric"" terrorist act, and declared Thursday a national day of mourning. He added that a number of terrorist attacks had been foiled in recent weeks and that as a result, the nationwide terror alert is now on its highest level. Extra security was also added to the offices of media outlets and places of worship in the capital.  Advertisement  Charlie Hebdo's religious satire has drawn the ire of radical Muslims before. Its offices were firebombed in 2011 after it published a caricature of the Prophet Muhammed. On Wednesday morning, it published a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State militant group which operates in Iraq and Syria and has called for ""lone wolf"" attacks on the West.  The magazine was already under police protection as a result of previous threats and one of the two policeman killed had been assigned to protect the newspaper's editor, Stephane Charbonnier — who was killed in the attack — following warnings that he would be targeted, according to France 24. The dead also included cartoonists Jean Cabut, Georges Wolinski, and Bernard Verlhac, as well as writer Bernard Maris.  The attack comes at a time when Islamic extremism is a key security concern across Europe. Lawmakers are particularly concerned that individuals who have joined armed extremist groups to fight in Syria might return home to stage attacks.  Prominent Muslim figures throughout Europe immediately denounced the killings. The Union of Islamic Organizations in France (UOIF) said in a statement: ""Charlie Hebdo has just become the target of an appalling attack… The UOIF condemns, in the strongest possible terms, this criminal attack and these horrible murders.""  US President Barack Obama pledged to help bring the perpetrators of this ""horrific shooting"" to justice, adding that France had consistently stood up for ""universal values"" and ""offered the world a timeless example that will endure well beyond the hateful vision of these killers.""  Advertisement  US Secretary of State John Kerry said the attackers could never destroy the core values of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and that the killings would only strengthen the French peoples' resolve to stand up for them. ""Today's murders are part of a larger confrontation, not between civilizations, no, but between civilization itself and those who are opposed to a civilized world,"" Kerry told reporters after a meeting with his Polish counterpart in Washington. ""The murderers dared proclaim Charlie Hebdo is dead, but make no mistake, they are wrong.""  In the hours following the attack the area surrounding the magazine's offices was silent and heavily locked down with a number of police perimeters and scores of uniform and plain-clothed officers as well as ambulances and fire trucks.  Many local residents were unable to return to their homes and stood around in the winter cold. ""It's dramatic, it's really weird that it happened in Paris. I've been here for an hour and I'm so shocked that [I] still haven't moved,"" David, a 23-year-old local resident whose way home was blocked by a police cordon told VICE News.  He blamed radicalized youth for the attacks. ""It happened because of the manipulation of young brains, manipulation of the young, especially those that are somewhat lost,"" he said to nods from those around him. Most were adamant that the magazine should continue working as it always had for decades. ""It is a satirical journal. They made fun of everyone, Jews, Catholics, Chinese,"" Francoise, 63, told VICE News. ""The criticism, the satire is my culture. I was vaccinated on Charlie Hebdo,"" he said, brandishing a battered copy of the magazine that he produced from his coat. ""We are hurt, I didn't know them [the victims] personally, but I'm sad.""  He added that France should still strive toward peaceful multiculturalism. ""To live together is what we should do. Diversity isn't a flaw."" As dusk fell, thousands of people began to gather in Paris's Place de la Republique for an unofficial rally in solidarity with the magazine's staff.  Crowds packed even the entrances to the square, but the gathering remained subdued. Many stood silent holding candles and placards. Occasionally chants of ""Freedom of expression!"" and ""Je suis Charlie"" broke out.  Adrian, 23, brandished a sign reading ""Charb[bonnier] died free"". He told VICE News that he wrote the message because the Charlie Hebdo editor ""knew he was threatened and he continued to do what he thought was right."""
E671,0,Reddit In Chaos After Allegedly Firing AMA Coordinator Victoria Taylor,"If you tried to visit r/IAmA (one of Reddit’s biggest subs) recently, you were probably greeted by the image above. And if you’ve been absolutely anywhere else on the site at all in the past few hours, you probably noticed that everyone is flipping their collective shit over speculation that Victoria Taylor, the high-profile coordinator that kept IAmA afloat, was suddenly and mysteriously fired. Also, something about Jesse Jackson.  What’s actually going on?  In addition to being one of the internet’s premier incubators for racism and bigotry of all sorts, Reddit is also perhaps best known for its AmAs (otherwise known as “Ask Me Anything”)—in which people with varying degrees of celebrity will come and answer questions for the masses to see. Coordinating and verifying all those celebrities takes a massive amount of work, which is why Victoria Taylor, the site’s Director of Talent, seems to have been so immensely beloved by the site’s many, voluntary moderators—she was good.  Apparently, where other Reddit “admins” (read: actual, paid Reddit employees) usually brush off moderators’ questions and concerns, Taylor seemed to have a reputation for actually giving a shit. When asked why r/AmA had gone private, one of the subreddit’s mods, karmanaut, explained:  And as AmA mod brownboy13 said in response to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s attempts to defuse the situation:  To be honest, this is just wrong. I don’t think you were still involved with Reddit when we started getting very very popular and had a regular stream of celebrity AMAs incoming. We didn’t have the ability or resources to walk them through it, or to schedule AMAs, or provide any other form of support. /r/IAmA limped along without her. We managed to move from fire to fire and had some truly poor quality posts from people who didn’t understand Reddit or what the AMA format was all about. Woody Harrelson, of course, is the prime example. Another would be the fake Emilia Clarke AMA that blew up and everyone thought was real until her manager personally contacted us to tell us that it was wrong. And it translates into bad press for Redditwhen that happens. The subreddit is going to continue to grow by what, 7 or 8 thousand users per day? By saying that we’re returning to the pre-Victoria status quo, you’re admitting that you’re shooting us in the leg but still expecting us to run the same speed. We can’t do that. And frankly, interactions with other Reddit admins have not been amazing. We’re constantly ignored by the community team even when discussing serious issues that need some admin resolution. And as someone else already pointed out, one of the main times that we relied on the general admin team to set up and run an AMA, it was a clusterfuck: Morgan Freeman. Because no one thought to get clear proof that it was really him. Victoria wouldn’t make that mistake.  Its not just moderators for that specific subreddit, though. Taylor’s loss is apparently having ripple effects over major portions of the site. One r/Science moderator (another of the site’s biggest subreddits) even threatened to shut that down over the unexplained loss:  I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA, letting Victoria go is a slap. To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs, Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins. If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be “Sorry, I can’t help.” Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that’s how much of a bad taste this leaves.  And this is just the latest in the recent string of Redditor revolts. Granted, most recently the issue was the Nazi-themed protests in response to the banning of five, small, particularly toxic subreddits—but regardless, tensions are high.  Compounding the issue is the fact that, other than Ellen Pao, Reddit’s almost universally user-despised interim CEO (due to the fact that she does actually enforce the site’s new harassment policy), Taylor was one of the only visible women playing any sort of key role in the company.  While Reddit declined to comment to Gawker on the circumstances surrounding her leaving, we do know that she certainly wasn’t expecting it. In a thread requesting some sort of comment from her, Taylor responded saying that she was “dazed.”  Why is Victoria Taylor out?  There are two possibilities that seem likely at this point. The first being the fact that Reddit had announced months ago that it would start requiring its employees to relocate to San Francisco. Taylor is currently living in New York.  The second (and my favorite) theory:  So the current rumor is Jesse Jackson's AMA led to Victoria being fired at Reddit, and this shitstorm starting up.Unconfirmed, of course. July 3, 2015  Yes.  Yesterday, Jesse Jackson hosted an AMA that went absolutely to shit. Jackson seemed to be providing arbitrary answers to questions that had never been asked, regardless of what he was responding to. When asked “What are some things that the average African-American can do to help reduce racial tensions in his area?” Jackson wrote three, non-sensical paragraphs that started with “Well, the source of those tensions often come from denial of an even playing field. You know, we are very good at athletics.”  One particularly vicious post asked, “My question is simple; how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife? Bonus question: How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme? Do you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive?” To which Jackson offered:  Which, though an absolute and utter mess, isn’t necessarily Taylor’s fault, so it doesn’t seem like a fireable offense in itself—although the timing does raise an eyebrow.  Either way, Taylor has yet to make any substantial statement on her apparent dismissal, but if you have any more information about what the hell is going on over at Reddit, you can send me an email here.  Update 10:15pm:  As of right now, the following default (i.e. major) subreddits have shut down, according to Reddit user Greypo, “in protest of the admins’ lack of communication with the moderators and ignoring their opinions, ideas, and requests. The firing of Victoria was the catalyst.”  We’ll update this list periodically, but you can see a more complete list (including non-default subreddits) here.  Update 12:10am:  To the three subscribers of /r/sexwithbears, we are so sorry for your loss.  Update 1:42am:  An image of what is allegedly a now-deleted post on Quora from Marc Bodnick, the site’s Business and Community Leader, has been making its way around Reddit:  I’ve reached out to Bodnick for confirmation, but it certainly seems like the most plausible explanation so far.  On a more somber note, we would like to also extend our condolences to the darkened members of /r/TreesSuckingOnThings.  Update 9:02am:  Ohanian seems to be rightfully panicking over the fact huge portions of his site have gone dark. From a weak sort of mea culpa he posted earlier this morning, which you can read in full here:  That said, I would like to accomplish two things immediately: Get the blacked out subreddits back online Your message was received loud and clear. The communication between Reddit and the moderators needs to improve dramatically. We will work closely with you all going forward to ensure events like today don’t happen again. At this point, however, the blackout has served its purpose, and now it’s time to get Reddit functioning again. I know many of you are still upset. We will continue to work through these issues with you all, but redditors don’t deserve to be punished any further over an issue that is ultimately between Reddit and the moderators. Work out a plan for going forward In the short-term, we will use this forum to discuss how we will improve being a moderator on reddit. I’ll personally be in here asking and listening. There are a couple of changes we can make immediately to improve our relationship: u/krispykrackers[5] , a well-trusted employee and community member, is now going to be point person for moderator issues. This should help alleviate the immediate pain, and we’ll continue to evaluate how it’s working going forward. ... Longer term, we are building tools to help you all do your jobs more effectively (anti-brigading and better modmail/tools are already in progress). We will build these with your input and incorporate more transparency. We have many ideas, and we would like to hear yours. We will keep you all in the loop as our plans crystallize into actual tools.    Meanwhile, /r/Pics is apparently ground zero right now. The subreddit has beens switching between private and public all morning, at first seemingly due to a Reddit employee override, according to this Imgur post:  But this screenshot of a conversation between moderators from the Reddit’s own liveblog seems to suggest otherwise:  It’s still not totally clear what’s going on, other than, of course, mass panic and paranoia.  As of right now, the sub is live but consists almost entirely of pictures of Taylor herself.  Update 9:56am:  Looks like even /r/funny, the site’s single biggest subreddit at nearly 9 million subscribers, has shuttered its doors in solidarity. Will anyone ever laugh again? It’s impossible to know for sure.  Update 10:07am:  An important message from your sisters and brothers in self-celibate solidarity over at /r/NoFap:  Unfortunately for them, /r/MILF is still very much alive.  Update 11:02am:  Reddit CEO Ellen Pao has finally weighed in on the upheaval:  And—surprise! People are pissed.  Update 12:16pm:  Ellen Pao’s post has been deleted almost as fast as it appeared, but according to Reddit’s liveblog:  It is being sugested that the mods of /r/sysadmin have removed the post because it’s still visible on the chairwoman’s profile.  In other news, /r/electronic_cigarette has also darkened its doors. May they forever chase that dank-ass cloud in peace.  Update 2:07pm:  Well, would ya look who’s back.  Update 2:52pm:  Apparently, Ohanian’s initial attempt to appease Reddit’s masses may have been what really set the whole thing off in the first place.  After promising that he did have the situation under control and would be handling any AmA requests himself (a less-than-welcome prospect for the already pissed-off redditors), the co-founder (username kn0thing) seems to have let his frustrations get the better of him:  A sassy little quip that elicited all sorts of angry responses from “I’m not mad just disappointed” to a more direct “fuck off you unprofessional dick.” The sentiment, however, was the same.  Update 3:07pm:  /r/funny is back online. You may proceed to laugh.  Update 3:49pm:  Remember all that weird drama with /r/pics? One of the subreddit’s moderators, beernerd, has cleared a few things up for us over email:  u/knotknox made fake screenshots suggesting that the admins forced our hand. It was just a joke at the time, but once the blackout brigade got ahold of it they didn’t really care if it was real or not. This whole issue was never just about Victoria being fired. It was about a lack of communication between the reddit mods and management. Firing Victoria was just the final straw. But these users who are brigading r/pics want to turn it into another Ellen Pao hatefest.  In other words, the reason the subreddit is live now has nothing to do with Reddit employees suddenly pulling rank and overriding moderators. Rather, it seems like the mods simply came to their senses and realized that, if anything is ever actually going to get fixed, they’re going to need to use their adult words. Which is to say, any words at all.  Either way, it is more than we can say for those three, steadfast subscribers over at /r/sexwithbears, who continue to block themselves off from everyone but each other. And, presumably, bears.  Update 10:30pm:  In an email to Gawker, Reddit spokesperson Heather Wilson passed along Ellen Pao’s official statement on the situation:  I want to apologize for how we handled the transition yesterday. We should have informed the moderators earlier and provided more detail on the transition plan. We are working to make improvements and create the best experience for our users and we aren’t always perfect. Our community is what makes reddit, reddit and we let you down yesterday.  Meanwhile, Reddit’s front page has essentially turned into a Pao-themed virtual guillotine.  Update 7/4 2:04pm:  No war is without its casualties. So it is with deep regret that I inform you of the following:  Whether /r/SexWithBears will ever reconvene is, ultimately, of no concern. Because though its three subscribers may be gone, their dream—through all of us—lives on. Rawr.  "
politifact11855,0,China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites,"At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.  It was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. ""It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,"" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.  For China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. ""The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,"" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. ""China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there."" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of antiÂ­satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.  INTERNATIONAL THREAT  For many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. ""Space debris is a huge problem,"" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed."" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger.  Although the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials—reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance—chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.  Battlefield: Space  1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.  2] Experts believe a four-stage, solidÂ­-fuel launch vehicle—thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2—boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.  3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.  4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite.  5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.  Some details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)  NASA  AMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS  Every industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.  Some satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. ""You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,"" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. ""You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them.""  Such an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. ""There'd be so much debris up there,"" Clark says, ""that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space.""  The United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. ""The consensus,"" Clark says, ""was that anybody could look at anybody else.""  Diagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.  Nevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.  To develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles.  Over the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985 the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected.  That same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.  Some $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.  Destroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalÂ­Security says, ""It's an act of war.""  U.S. Sat Kill Arsenal  --Davin Coburn  1] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes.  2] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985, when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  3] In 1997 the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program.  4] The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.  SENDING A MESSAGE  So why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. ""The experiment is not targeted at any other country,"" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.  Some experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that ""The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.""  The United States ""basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,"" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: ""Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state.""  In that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. ""The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,"" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ""For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.""  Pike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.  ""The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,"" Pike says. ""Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time."" A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that's all it would take. ""Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.""  In that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible.  AMERICA'S TRUMP CARD  The long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. ""It was a mistake,"" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, ""It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,"" Vick says. ""It is a threat, and the test showed that."" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only 60 satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down.  America's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, ""just nothing to shoot at.""  For now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.  Waste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.  JULY 2007  JANUARY 2008  It's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. ""Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,"" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know."" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles -- and Kessler's looming threat. -- Erin McCarthy  The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.  Source: Analysis courtesy of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation/Analytical Graphics, Inc. Data as of April 26, 2007. Objects greatly magnified for visibility.  Litter Kings Sad to say, but some space junk -- such as spent boosters -- simply comes with the territory. Other flotsam results from indifference or lousy planning, such as the bags of garbage Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned from the MIR space station for 15 years. Here's how the three busiest space players stack up.  United States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles.  Russia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately 1200 pieces of fresh debris.  China: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. ""Almost 85 percent of that debris will be in orbit in 100 years,"" says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""It shows how badly they messed things up with one event."" -- E.M.

pheme_144,0,"Hostages held in Sydney cafe, Islamic flag seen in window: local TV","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hostages were being held inside a central Sydney cafe where a black flag with white Arabic writing could be seen in the window, local television showed on Monday, raising fears of an attack linked to Islamic militants.  Australia, which is backing the United States and its escalating action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, is on high alert for attacks by radicalized Muslims or by home-grown fighters returning from fighting in the Middle East.  Part of Martin Place, home to the Reserve Bank of Australia, commercial banks and close to the New South Wales (NSW) state parliament, was closed off by armed police.  Live television footage showed patrons inside a cafe standing with their hands pressed against the windows. A black and white flag similar to those used by Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria was also visible.  NSW Police tweeted: “A police operation is underway in Martin Place, Sydney’s CBD. People are advised to avoid the area.”  Dozens of police including a SWAT team were setting up and a couple of hundred people were being held back by cordons.  Trains and buses were stopped and roads were blocked in the area, with train operators saying there had been a bomb threat at Martin Place."
E539,0,Kermit and Miss Piggy Break Up: Who Cheated?,"It's easy to read between the lines of the couple's announcement  Who Broke Up Kermit and Miss Piggy? A Look at the Suspects  By now, the last remaining thread of your childhood has likely been severed by the news that Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, of Muppets fame, have ""terminated"" (could they have picked a less-sensitive word?) their relationship.  It’s easy to read between the lines of their statement: “Miss Piggy made the difficult decision to terminate our romantic relationship … our personal lives are now distinct and separate, and we will be seeing other people, pigs, frogs, et al. This is our only comment on this private matter.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Translation: Someone totally cheated. (You know, probably.)  Now, the only question is, who? Who broke up the longest-lasting relationship in the history of felt? What monster (perhaps literally, perhaps figuratively) would do such a thing? Below, we take a look at some of the likely suspects.  The Swedish Chef  Though the Swedish Chef might not be fluent in any actual language, who hasn’t been tempted by a lovingly prepared Italian meal, candlelight and red wine?  The Great Gonzo has amply demonstrated his predilection for interspecies coupling. And he and Camilla the Chicken have been together for a long, long time. Surely he and Miss Piggy found plenty of time to commiserate about the stress of long-term relationships.  Janice  As the guitarist for the Electric Mayhem, Janice is no doubt familiar with the wanton lifestyle of the touring musician. “Come to my dressing room,” she might have said to Kermit, late one night. “Bring your banjo.

pheme_167,0,Sydney Crisis: Hostages Share Gunman's Demands in Chilling Phone Calls,"Media figures say they spoke directly to hostages who called their newsrooms.   -- Media personalities in Australia say they received calls today from hostages in the Sydney cafe standoff.  Ray Hadley was hosting his radio show on Australia’s 2GB station when he says a hostage called in on his show’s open line. Hadley did not put the hostage on-air live -- worried about the risks -- but says he spoke to the hostage in four conversations before police negotiators took over.  ""I could hear the hostage-taker in the background issuing instructions to him on what to request me to say on air,” Hadley told ABC News.  With the armed gunman nearby, the hostage couldn’t say much over the phone, especially nothing negative, Hadley recalled.  After speaking with the male hostage, Hadley consulted with police. A negotiator eventually arrived to his studio, picking up the conversation.  Other hostages, meanwhile, spoke off-air to the negotiator, Hadley said.  Hadley says the situation became “heart-wrenching” when a mother called into his show, saying her 18-year-old son was being held hostage inside the café.  “She was in a situation where she was feeling terribly bad for the hostages, and then she suddenly realized her own boy was inside there, being held hostage,” Hadley said.  Mark Burrows, a reporter with 9 News Australia, said he also spoke with two hostages who called his newsroom directly.  “The first one, as I spoke to her, the gunman was actually reeling his demands through her, a long list of demands,” Burrows said. “I think No. 1 was that he wanted to speak to someone with authority, but mainly the prime minister, and there were quite a few other of those demands.  “I asked her whether she was OK, she seemed reasonably relaxed.”  About an hour later, another hostage called, Burrows said, with the second hostage in a more “agitated” state.  “Again she had the gunman hovering over her, making these demands through her,” Burrows said. ""That lady was far more anxious, far more agitated, because she got the feeling nothing was being done, but that’s not the case.""  Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

E782,0,Wyoming man gets probation for harassing elk in viral video,"CASPER, Wyo., May 29 (UPI) -- A Wyoming man who filmed himself using a small aircraft to chase a herd of elk pleaded no contest to a charge of big game harassment.  Kevin Christopherson, 53, a Natrona County School District trustee, said he pleaded no contest May 20 the charges stemming from the 2014 video filmed in Converse County.  Advertisement  Christopherson was sentenced in Natrona County Circuit Court to one year of unsupervised probation and a one-year suspended jail sentence.  The video, filmed Sept. 23 of last year and posted to YouTube three days later, depicts Christopherson in an ultra-light trike, a type of small aircraft, flying close to the herd of elk and chasing them.  The Wyoming Game and Fish Department said the viral video resulted in more than 30 tips from concerned citizens.  Christopherson said he was attempting to help the Game and Fish Department by showing the size of the herd on video. He said he provided a copy of the video to officials before posting it online.  ""I have every reason to believe that I was helping them,"" Christopherson told the Casper Star Tribune.  Christopherson said the misdemeanor charge will not affect his work on the school board."
E48,0,California Implements Statewide Ban On All .45 ACP Ammunition,"The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo. The bill states that the ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 60 day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban.  Though the ban has created a clear divide among the citizens of California, it’s said to be widely supported by political figures across the state. Many politicians and citizens alike feel that that ban is a clear infringement of California citizen’s second amendment rights, however; many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control.      Joshua Lancaster, a spokesperson from the office of Governor Jerry Brown, made the following statement to the press, “The time to make clear cut changes surrounding our current gun laws is here. The ban on this unnecessary ammunition is a major step towards a safer society for our children. There are no obvious or justifiable reasons for one to own or use semi-automatic handgun ammunition of that caliber, if 9mm and .40 S&W rounds are sufficient for our police force to protect us with, they are sufficient for any private citizen’s personal protection.  The ban does extend to .45 GAP ammunition; however has an exemption for .45 Colt ammunition, which is used exclusively in revolvers and can often be found at Cowboy – Action games. According to state officials, the .45 Colt ammunition is less of a concern, as statistically far fewer crimes are carried out with the use of revolvers. The bill’s primary objective was to reduce the use of dangerous, high powered, semi-automatic handguns.  California is the first state to ban the .45 ACP ammunition; however several government representatives across the United States have said they will be keeping a close eye on the outcome of the bill. Many representatives from democratic leaning states have indicated they would be willing to follow suit if a clear connection can be made to the reduction of violent crimes. California officials are confident in their ability to show a drastic reduction to violent crimes well before the end of the year and are hopeful the ban will be implemented on a federal level prior to then.

E579,0,Is Planned Parenthood’s Fetal-Parts Trade Legal?,"UPDATE: House Speaker John Boehner calls for an investigation, after a sting operation on a Planned Parenthood medical director captured a jarring conversation over procuring fetal organs from abortions.  Editor’s Note: This article was updated on July 16.  LOS ANGELES — An undercover video released July 14 apparently shows Planned Parenthood’s medical director casually discussing over wine and salad how their affiliates harvest fetal body parts for medical research.  “I’d say a lot of people want liver,” said Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), at a lunch with two undercover investigators posing as representatives of a fetal-tissue collection agency, according to the transcript from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP).  Between sips of wine and gesticulating with her salad fork, Nucatola (who also performs abortions for Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles) describes in detail the techniques, the protocols and the cost involved in procuring the livers, hearts, lungs and brains of aborted unborn babies for scientists.  “We’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver,” she said, having noted that doing so depends on the abortionist placing the graspers above and below the unborn child’s body cavity, “because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part; I’m going to basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”  At one point, Nucatola appears to describe a procedure that CMP alleged is the partial-birth abortion procedure — dilation and extraction — where a baby is delivered feet first, except for the head, which is crushed. But from the transcript, it is unclear whether or not Nucatola was describing dismemberment taking place in the womb — dilation and evacuation — leaving the intact head for last, when dilation of a woman’s cervix would be the greatest.  Congress Investigates  House Republicans have responded to the video by launching an investigation into Planned Parenthood and the fetal-parts trade.  “When an organization monetizes an unborn child — and with the cavalier attitude portrayed in this horrific video — we must all act,” said House Speaker John Boehner in a statement calling on House committees to act and for President Barack Obama to condemn the practice.  U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who co-chairs the House bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus with Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., said at a press conference following the video’s release that “Congress must — and will — investigate and put an end to these barbaric practices.”  “Current law that proscribes altering abortion procedures in order to procure baby organs and body parts as well as the law that says it is ‘unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration’ need to be enforced and, if need be, strengthened,” he said. “The ban on partial-birth abortion and the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act may have relevance here. As does the House-passed Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.”  Legal Questions  While the video is shocking, and what Nucatola describes morally abhorrent, much of it may actually be legal.  The Center for Medical Progress, the organization behind the video, alleged it shows proof of a “criminal conspiracy” to buy and sell fetal parts for profit. The Register reached out to David Daleiden, the project lead in the outfit’s three-year undercover investigation of Planned Parenthood, but received no response to phone and email requests for an interview.  However, the facts about procuring fetal tissue do not appear so clear-cut. While selling human body parts in general is illegal, federal law does not prohibit tissue donations and allows fetal tissue donation — either from induced abortion, spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth — with “reasonable payments” for the “transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control or storage of human fetal tissue.” State laws governing organ donation, including from aborted babies, vary from state to state.The video only shows approximately nine minutes out of a nearly three-hour conversation. The full transcript accompanying the video gives the whole picture, and, there, Nucatola stated that the goal of procuring fetal tissue at Planned Parenthood facilities “is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line.” She said affiliates were looking to “break even” and explained that the service “should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because that’s not what it is.” “[Affiliates] want to come to a number that doesn’t look like they’re making money. They want to come to a number that looks like it is a reasonable number for the effort that is allotted on their part,” she said.  Nucatola added that PPFA affiliates are interested in the tissue-donation service because of the need to dispose of fetal tissue, since they generally pay a company, such as Stericycle, to dispose of biological material. At the same time, she said, it offers patients an opportunity to contribute to scientific research.  “At the end of the day, it is all just sitting there; it’s all just going to be wasted otherwise. That’s what it is: It’s a waste. It’s a complete and total waste,” she said.  While Nucatola in the video appears to discount a profit motive, StemExpress, one of the recipients of fetal material from Planned Parenthood mentioned in the exchange, sells vials of fetal liver cells from anywhere between $488 and $24,250.  However, StemExpress marketed its program on its literature and website as “financially profitable” to participating clinics, and it carried an endorsement from Dr. Dorothy Furgerson of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte.  A representative of StemExpress informed the Register on July 14 that the company is aware of the video and will be following up with a response. However, the Register received no reply to its follow-up calls and later found the company’s website temporarily shut down for “maintenance.”  Planned Parenthood Responds  Planned Parenthood responded by stating that the undercover video was “heavily edited” and “falsely portrays Planned Parenthood’s participation in tissue-donation programs that support lifesaving scientific research.”  “At several of our health centers, we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research, and we do this just like every other high-quality health-care provider does — with full, appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards,” said Eric Ferraro, PPFA’s vice president of communications, in a statement. “There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or Planned Parenthood. In some instances, actual costs, such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers, are reimbursed, which is standard across the medical field.”  But Casey Maddox, senior counsel with the public interest firm Alliance Defending Freedom, said it appears that “Planned Parenthood is carefully skirting this law, if not violating it.”  Maddox said the law allows for donations of tissue and reasonable fees, such as payments covering transportation, adding there is a line between a “reasonable fee” and “making a profit.”  Where that line is may be difficult to pin down. A federal investigation into a company called Opening Lines, which sold fetal body parts obtained from abortion centers, closed in 2008 without any charges, due to the lack of evidence that the proprietor was turning a profit. In that case, the company had charged as much as $999 for a brain of a late-term aborted baby. In response, pro-life congressmen at the time had called for a total ban on the sale of aborted fetal tissue.  By comparison, the Planned Parenthood medical director in the CMP video suggested a price of $30-$100 per “specimen.”  But Maddox also pointed out two problems: The video shows there may be violations of the federal partial-birth abortion ban. But he said a less obvious violation is the law prohibits changing the abortion procedure in order to procure tissue for research.  He pointed to the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, which stipulates “no alteration of the timing, method or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was made solely for the purposes of obtaining the tissue.”  “The video explicitly describes how they are changing the abortion in order to provide good tissue samples,” he said.  Calls for Action  The revelations have raised renewed support for banning late-term abortion based on fetal pain and prompted other calls for action.  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a candidate in the Republican presidential primary, announced July 14 he was ordering a state investigation into the “shocking and gruesome” allegations. He noted a Planned Parenthood affiliate is seeking to open an abortion center in New Orleans.  “I have instructed Louisiana’s Department of Health and Hospitals [DHH] to conduct an immediate investigation into this alleged evil and illegal activity and to not issue any licenses until this investigation is complete,” he said.  Other pro-life groups called on Congress to revoke all federal funding of Planned Parenthood.  Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life, called for Congress to use its subpoena power “to determine how Planned Parenthood is using taxpayer dollars and whether they are violating the federal prohibition on [the] sale of human body parts.”  “This video provides a shocking reality check about the grisly, inhumane business model of Planned Parenthood,” she said. “Under Cecile Richards’ leadership, breast screenings are down, abortions are up, and profits are up, as even the bodies of the unborn become something else for her to sell.”  Peter Jesserer Smith is the Register’s Washington correspondent.  Catholic News Agency contributed to this report."
politifact2281,0,"9/11 families, others rally in favor of NYC mosque","NEW YORK – The planned mosque and Islamic center blocks from ground zero got a new boost Wednesday from a coalition of supporters that includes families of Sept. 11 victims.  New York Neighbors for American Values rallied for the first time at a municipal building near ground zero.  ""I lost a 23-year-old son, a paramedic who gave his life saving Americans and their values,"" Talat Hamdani said, and supporting the Islamic center and mosque ""has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with standing up for our human rights, including freedom of religion.""  Among the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 were more than 30 Muslims, she noted.  Opponents of the Islamic center project argue it's insensitive to the families and memories of Sept. 11 victims to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion.  The new coalition was started by members of 40 civic and religious organizations that ""spontaneously called each other, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York office of the watchdog group Common Cause.  The controversy was triggered by ""irresponsible politicians"" using it as an election issue, she said. Names mentioned at the rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Gingrich has suggested that building the mosque near ground zero is akin to putting a Nazi sign ""next to the Holocaust Museum."" Reid has broken ranks with President Barack Obama by saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere.  Coalition members are now contacting officials, asking them to support the project as a reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of ""crude stereotypes meant to frighten and divide us.""  They plan a candlelight vigil near ground zero on Sept. 10, the eve of the ninth Sept. 11 anniversary.  ""This is not just about Muslims; this is about who we are as Americans,"" said Lerner, adding that to oppose the Islamic center is ""a slippery slope. There will always be people who are offended standing next to people who are different from others.""  Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of New York's Shalom Center, said the project will show the world a form of Islam that espouses peace — not the Islam of the terrorists.  ""It is right; it is wise to build it,"" he told hundreds of people gathered under the arches of Manhattan's Municipal Building, a short walk from ground zero.  Several coalition members noted that the mosque site's developer, Sharif el-Gamal, modeled it after the Jewish Community Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It serves anyone who wishes to participate, they said, and so will the Muslim center near ground zero."
E533,0,Whole Foods' $6 Asparagus Water Is Just Water With Three Stalks of Asparagus in It [Updated],"Posted on Aug 3, 2015 at 8:03am PDT  Twitter user Layla Dhere (@dhere) expressed confusion in a recent tweet featuring the above image of a row of bottles of what is labeled ""Asparagus Water"" on a shelf. The bottles appear to be filled with water and three stalks of raw asparagus. They are priced at $5.99 each. Dhere is right to be perplexed.  ""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""  The labels say ""Whole Foods,"" and the date on the bottles is current. A call to the supermarket (these particular bottles are from the Whole Foods in Brentwood, Calif. though in the New York City area grocery delivery service Instacart, which is a partner of Whole Foods, lists ""Asparagus Water"") at first produced some bewilderment. The operator denied the product existed. Eventually she transferred the call to a gentleman in the produce department who did not want to give his name. He explained that the product was new, ""We've had them on the shelf for the last few days."" When asked how the item is made, he said, ""It's water, and we sort of cut asparagus stalks down so they're shorter, and put them into the container."" When Eater asked what it was for, there was a long pause before he said, ""Well, it's... to drink."" He elaborated, ""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""  As a point of comparison, Whole Foods has whole bundles of asparagus on sale for about $5.  A search for ""Asparagus Water"" doesn't turn up any recipes or news articles; it's seemingly not a common item. And the Whole Foods employees Eater spoke with said it was not a product that had been requested by customers. Eater has reached out to Whole Foods' corporate office for comment. Perhaps Whole Foods' Asparagus Water will be sold for $3.99 at its new lower-priced 365 markets.  But maybe the pricey grocer is ahead of the game and vegetable water is the new bone broth? Or, Whole Foods is trolling its own employees, and ripping off customers as usual.  Update 8/3/15; 6:20 p.m. EST: Whole Foods' Senior Media Relations Specialist Liz Burkhart responded to Eater's request for comment by explaining that it was all a big misunderstanding:  ""We appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We looked into this right away and found that this item was being carried in just one of our stores in California. It was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms to be used as broth (similar to a bone broth), which are typically made over a long period of time soaking in water. The product was made incorrectly and has since been removed from the one store where it was carried. We read your story, and would love your help clarifying that this product isn't and never has been available for online ordering on Instacart and was only ever offered in one store.""

E707,0,Adelaide High School students suspended over abusive Facebook messages sent to feminist writer Clementine Ford,"Adelaide High School students suspended over abusive Facebook messages sent to feminist writer Clementine Ford  Updated  Three Adelaide High School students have been suspended for sending abusive messages to a feminist writer and joking about violence against women.  Clementine Ford put her views online after about 400 women and girls from South Australia had their intimate photographs posted on a website without permission.  Ms Ford posted a photo of herself on Facebook with a message against TV show Sunrise, accusing it of blaming the victims for what happened.  There is a growing problem of ""revenge porn"" being posted on the internet, sometimes by former partners after a couple breaks up.  Ms Ford said the trend was disturbing.  ""It's not about sex, it's about power,"" she said.  ""This isn't about seeing someone nude, it's about seeing someone nude when you know that they haven't consented, having the added thrill of knowing that they're humiliated.""  Ms Ford's Facebook post in defence of women provoked threats and abuse against her and she re-posted some of those comments, including messages from three boys from Adelaide High.  When the school found out, the boys were suspended and principal Anita Zocchi published a letter on the school website in which she said the students comments were ""abhorrent"".  This isn't about seeing someone nude, it's about seeing someone nude when you know that they haven't consented, having the added thrill of knowing that they're humiliated. Clementine Ford  She said the school had been inundated with emails telling it what the boys had done and they were now remorseful.  ""They are quite distressed,"" Ms Zocchi said.  ""I have to add they have a very good record in the school and they understand the huge error of their ways.""  Ms Ford said she was impressed with the school's handling of the matter.  ""It worries me that there is a continuing groundswell of entitlement that young men are feeling over women and particularly over women's bodies, that they can say whatever they want and threaten and harass,"" she said.  Ford calls on Facebook to take issue more seriously  She said people seemed spurred on by the sense of anonymity they thought social media gave them.  ""This is why part of my activism is about dispelling these myths of the basement-dwelling monster - most of these people are normal,"" she said.  Ms Ford was banned from Facebook for reposting some of the abuse she received, but the site did not ban the men who made the comments initially.  She said the company needs to change.  ""I would like to see companies like Facebook start to take these issues a lot more seriously,"" she said.  ""In its early days Twitter had similar problems with online abuse of women and I feel they have demonstrated that they are really willing to come to the table on this.

E398,0,Jack Nicholson on Abortion: ‘I’m Positively Against It’ -- 'I Never Would Have Gotten to Live',"Jack Nicholson, Academy Award winning actor who is ""positively against"" abortion. (AP)  (CNSNews.com) -- Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson, 76, who is retiring from movies it was reported today, is, unlike many liberals in Tinseltown, a staunch pro-lifer who said in a 1984 interview about abortion, “I’m positively against it. I don’t have the right to any other view.""  He added that it was the moral character of his mother and grandmother that ensured he himself had not been aborted.  The Academy Award-winning Nicholson was born on Apr. 22, 1937 to a woman named June Frances Nicholson, who was 17 years old at the time and a showgirl dancer. Jack was raised by his maternal grandparents, John Nicholson and Ethel May, believing they were his real parents and that June Frances was his sister. Jack Nicholson did not find out until 1974, after his mother had died of cancer, that June Frances was his real mother.  In the 1984 Rolling Stone interview, Jack Nicholson described his mother and the life she had lived and also talked about abortion. He said, “I’m very contra my constituency in terms of abortion because I’m positively against it. I don’t have the right to any other view.”  June Frances Nicholson, mother of actor Jack Nicholson.  “My only emotion is gratitude, literally, for my life,” said Nicholson. “[If June and Ethel had been] of less character, I never would have gotten to live. These women gave me the gift of life.”  “It’s a feminist narrative in the very pure form,” said Nicholson. “They trained me great, those ladies. I still, to this day, have never borrowed a nickel from anybody and never felt like I couldn’t take care of myself. They made the imperative of my self-sufficiency obvious.”  Nicholson disclosed that he never learned who his father was because the only people who really knew were his mother, June Frances, and his grandmother, Ethel May, and they had died before he even learned, in 1974, the true identity of his mother. “[T]hey never told anybody,” said Nicholson.  June Frances had married showman Donald Furcillo (in October 1936) six months prior to the birth of her son, John Joseph “Jack” Nicholson. But Furcillo was already married and, also partly because of Furcillo’s reported drinking, the marriage to June Frances did not work out.  Academy Award-winning actor Jack Nicholson. (AP)  In further describing his mother in the interview, Nicholson said, “June and I had so much in common. We both fight hard. It didn’t do her any good not to tell me, but she didn’t because you never know how I would’ve reacted when I was younger. I got a job in Mexico when June was dying. First time with a studio, a lot of weeks. Sandra [Jack’s wife 1962-68] was pregnant with Jennifer [Jack’s daughter], and June was in a terminal state. She looked me right in the eye and said, ‘Shall I wait?’ In other words, ‘Shall I try and fight this through?’ And I said no.”  Nicholson was raised a Roman Catholic, the religion of his mother, and grew up in Neptune City, New Jersey. He has won three Academy Awards, including best actor for his role in the 1975 film “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and the 1997 film “As Good as It Gets.”  RadarOnline.com reported on Sept. 4 that Jack Nicholson was retiring from the movie business apparently, at age 76, because of memory loss problems. Nicholson has starred in at least 65 films since 1958."
pheme_278,0,Toronto Maple Leafs on lockdown after shootings in Ottawa,"A terrifying situation in Canada's capital city of Ottawa has resulted in Wednesday night's game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Senators being postponed.  A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country's capital was shot to death Wednesday, and gunfire then erupted inside Parliament, authorities said.  One gunman was killed, and police said they were searching for as many as two others in what Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, called a ""dynamic, unfolding situation.''  Heavily armed Canadian police backed by armored vehicles surrounded Parliament in Ottawa on Wednesday after at least one gunman reportedly shot a soldier guarding the nearby War Memorial monument. Michel Comte/AFP/Getty Images  The Ottawa police, via its official Twitter account, warned the public to stay away from that area while it investigated.  The Maple Leafs were on lockdown earlier Wednesday at the team's hotel in downtown Ottawa, a team representative confirmed to ESPN.com. A team spokesman said the Maple Leafs were scheduled to leave Ottawa later in the afternoon.  The NBA's Toronto Raptors, meanwhile, said they were working with local police to have extra security in place for their preseason game at home Wednesday night.

pheme_282,0,"'Canada will never be intimidated,' Harper says after shootings in Ottawa","Two “despicable attacks” on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country’s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.  Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.  The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.  Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.  “This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.  “We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.  “But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”  Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”  National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”  The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.  Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""  But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”  RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.  Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.  Panic on the Hill  The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.  When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.  A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.  Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.  Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.  Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.  Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.  Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.  ""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.  ""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""  Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.  Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.  “This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.  He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.  “If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.  The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.  Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.  “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”  The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.  On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.  Security beefed up  The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.  Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.  U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.  Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.  The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”  “We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.  A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”  With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press  An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

However, according to several reports, the creature allegedly was lured from his protected park and then shot by a U.S. dentist with a bow and arrow.  (Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force)  UPDATE  HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Zimbabwean police said Tuesday they are searching for an American who allegedly shot a well-known, protected lion with a crossbow in a killing that has outraged conservationists and others.  The American allegedly paid $50,000 to kill the lion named Cecil, Zimbabwean conservationists said. Authorities on Tuesday said two Zimbabwean men will appear in court for allegedly helping with the hunt.  Hunter who killed ""Cecil"" the lion in Zimbabwe reportedly identified as an American dentist. http://t.co/zifFyYswG6 pic.twitter.com/xcPRiKMT4k — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) July 28, 2015  Walter James Palmer was identified on Tuesday by both the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force and the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe as the American hunter, which police then confirmed.  Emmanuel Fundira, the president of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe, said at a news conference that Palmer is from Minnesota and his current whereabouts were unknown.  The American faces poaching charges, according to police spokeswoman Charity Charamba. ""We arrested two people and now we are looking for Palmer in connection with the same case,"" she said.  Phone calls to two listed home phone numbers for Palmer rang busy on Tuesday. Phone calls to his dental office in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington also went unanswered, and a message couldn't be left because the office mailbox was full.  Walt Palmer, Cecil the Lion 'killer' has his dentist review page hijacked by very angry people http://t.co/frEuJnFORz http://t.co/LMqlDYEUAH — HuffPost UK (@HuffPostUK) July 28, 2015  The front door to the office building was locked when a reporter approached Tuesday morning. A woman who came to the door said Palmer was not in the office and was not seeing patients on Tuesday.  The two arrested Zimbabwean men -- a professional hunter and a farm owner -- face poaching charges, the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority and the Safari Operators Association said in a joint statement. Killing the lion was illegal because the farm owner did not have a hunting permit, the joint statement said.  The lion was skinned and beheaded. The hunters tried to destroy the lion's collar, fitted with a tracking device, but failed, the statement said.  If convicted, the men face up to 15 years in prison.  The lion is believed to have been killed on July 1 in western Zimbabwe's wildlife-rich Hwange region, its carcass discovered days later by trackers, the statement said.  The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said in a statement that an American paid the $50,000 for the hunt. During a nighttime hunt, the men tied a dead animal to their car to lure the lion out of a national park, said Johnny Rodrigues, chairman of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force. The American is believed to have shot it with a crossbow, injuring the animal. The wounded lion was found 40 hours later, and shot dead with a gun, Rodrigues said in the statement.  ""The saddest part of all is that now that Cecil is dead, the next lion in the hierarchy, Jericho will most likely kill all Cecil's cubs,"" said Rodrigues.  Cecil, recognizable by his black mane, was being studied by an Oxford University research program, the conservation group said.  Tourists regularly spotted his characteristic mane in the park over the last 13 years, said Lion Aid, also a conservation group."

One lawmaker said they told negotiators they ""want to die as martyrs.""  French security forces poured into the small industrial town of Dammartin-en-Goele near Charles de Gaulle airport after the suspects hijacked a car early Friday in a nearby town. Authorities are determined to seize the men suspected of carrying out France's deadliest terror attack in decades — the attack Wednesday in Paris that left 12 people dead at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.  One of the men had been convicted of terrorism charges in 2008, the other had visited Yemen. A U.S. official said both brothers — 32-year-old Cherif Kouachi and 34-year-old Said Kouachi — were on the American no-fly list.  ""They said they want to die as martyrs,"" Yves Albarello, a local lawmaker who said he was inside the command post, told French television station i-Tele.  At least three helicopters hovered over the town, and authorities appealed for residents to stay inside. Charles de Gaulle closed two runways to arrivals to avoid interfering in the standoff, an airport spokesman said.  Authorities evacuated a school near the CTF Creation Tendance Decouverte printing plant around midday Friday after the suspects agreed by phone to allow the children safe passage, town spokeswoman Audrey Taupenas told The Associated Press. About an hour later, an AP reporter counted nine large, empty buses headed toward the area, apparently to evacuate the children.  Taupenas said there appeared to be one hostage, a number confirmed by a police official on the scene who was not allowed to discuss the operation.  A man who said he had his car stolen early Friday told Europe 1 the first man who approached him was armed with machine gun and the second man had a gun ""with a kind of grenade at the end.""  Tens of thousands of French security forces have mobilized to prevent a new terror attack since the assault on Charlie Hebdo, which decimated its editorial staff, including the chief editor who had been under armed guard after receiving death threats for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. He and his police bodyguard were the first to die, witnesses said.  Cherif and Said Kouachi were named as the chief suspects after Said's identity card was left behind in their abandoned getaway car. Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said both suspects had been known to intelligence services before the attack.  Louis Zenon, a 14-year-old who lives close to siege site, watched as helicopters hovered over closed-off industrial area.  ""There is a lot of fear,"" he said, adding everyone he knew was staying home with their doors and shutters closed. ""We're scared. The schools are being evacuated.""  A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there. Witnesses said he claimed allegiance to the group during the attack.  The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq.  Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. The American officials also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss foreign intelligence publicly.  Nine people, members of the brothers' entourage, have been detained for questioning in several regions. In all, 90 people, many of them witnesses to the grisly assault on the satirical weekly, were questioned for information on the attackers, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.

Shots were fired as the brothers stole a car in the early morning hours, said a French security official, who could not immediately confirm reports of hostage | ASSOCIATED PRESS  PARIS (AP) -- A gunman holding at least five hostages in a Paris kosher market has threatened to kill them if French authorities launch an assault on two cornered al-Qaida-linked brothers suspected in a newspaper massacre, a police official said Friday.  Terrorists linked to each other seized hostages at two locations around Paris on Friday, facing off against thousands of French security forces as the city shut down a famed Jewish neighborhood and scrambled to protect residents and tourists from further attacks.  France has been high alert for more attacks since the country's worst terror attack in decades -- the massacre Wednesday in Paris at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead.  The two sets of hostage-takers apparently know each other, said a police official who was not authorized to discuss the rapidly developing situations with the media.  The Paris mayor's office announced the closure of all shops along Rosiers Street in the city's famed Marais neighborhood in the heart of the tourist district. Hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the street is usually crowded with shoppers -- French Jews and tourists alike. The street is also only a kilometer (a half mile) away from Charlie Hebdo's offices.  Two brothers linked to al-Qaida grabbed a hostage early Friday and were cornered by police inside a printing house in Dammartin-en-Goele, northeast of Paris.

politifact937,0,A Solar Grand Plan: Scientific American,"Spacer  Back  IMAGE 1 of 8  of 8 Next    Key Concepts A massive switch from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power plants to solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050.  A vast area of photovoltaic cells would have to be erected in the Southwest. Excess daytime energy would be stored as compressed air in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours.  Large solar concentrator power plants would be built as well.  A new direct-current power transmission backbone would deliver solar electricity across the country.  But $420 billion in subsidies from 2011 to 2050 would be required to fund the infrastructure and make it cost-competitive. —The Editors  High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay. The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests. And as China, India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels, future fighting over energy looms large. In the meantime, power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, as well as vehicles everywhere, continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually, threatening the planet.  Well-meaning scientists, engineers, economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil-fuel use and emissions. These steps are not enough. The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels. Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer.  Solar energy’s potential is off the chart. The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year. The U.S. is lucky to be endowed with a vast resource; at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone are suitable for constructing solar power plants, and that land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of solar radiation a year. Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nation’s total energy consumption in 2006.  To convert the country to solar power, huge tracts of land would have to be covered with photovoltaic panels and solar heating troughs. A direct-current (DC) transmission backbone would also have to be erected to send that energy efficiently across the nation.  The technology is ready. On the following pages we present a grand plan that could provide 69 percent of the U.S.’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy (which includes transportation) with solar power by 2050. We project that this energy could be sold to consumers at rates equivalent to today’s rates for conventional power sources, about five cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). If wind, biomass and geothermal sources were also developed, renewable energy could provide 100 percent of the nation’s electricity and 90 percent of its energy by 2100.  The federal government would have to invest more than $400 billion over the next 40 years to complete the 2050 plan. That investment is substantial, but the payoff is greater. Solar plants consume little or no fuel, saving billions of dollars year after year. The infrastructure would displace 300 large coal-fired power plants and 300 more large natural gas plants and all the fuels they consume. The plan would effectively eliminate all imported oil, fundamentally cutting U.S. trade deficits and easing political tension in the Middle East and elsewhere. Because solar technologies are almost pollution-free, the plan would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 1.7 billion tons a year, and another 1.9 billion tons from gasoline vehicles would be displaced by plug-in hybrids refueled by the solar power grid. In 2050 U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be 62 percent below 2005 levels, putting a major brake on global warming.  Photovoltaic Farms  In the past few years the cost to produce photovoltaic cells and modules has dropped significantly, opening the way for large-scale deployment. Various cell types exist, but the least expen­sive modules today are thin films made of cadmium telluride. To provide electricity at six cents per kWh by 2020, cadmium telluride modules would have to convert electricity with 14 percent efficiency, and systems would have to be installed at $1.20 per watt of capacity. Current modules have 10 percent efficiency and an installed system cost of about $4 per watt. Progress is clearly needed, but the technology is advancing quickly; commercial efficiencies have risen from 9 to 10 percent in the past 12 months. It is worth noting, too, that as modules improve, rooftop photovoltaics will become more cost-competitive for homeowners, reducing daytime electricity demand."
pheme_103,0,"'Terrorist' murdered soldier 'in cold blood,' Canada's Prime Minister says","(CNN) -- First a soldier guarding a hallowed war memorial was gunned down in Canada's capital. Then shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later.  The two shootings in Ottawa Wednesday left lawmakers barricaded inside offices and parts of the city on lockdown for hours as police searched for suspects.  Ottawa Police lifted the lockdown Wednesday night and said there was no longer a danger to the public.  But many questions remain about the shootings: Who was the gunman? Why did he open fire? And was he acting alone?  ""It appears there was just one shooter, and that shooter is dead,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""But it has been a traumatic experience, obviously, for not only our city but the country.""  Investigators haven't provided any possible motives for the shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper didn't provide details about the investigation in a televised address to the nation Wednesday night.  ""In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had, but this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" Harper said. ""Let there be no misunderstanding: We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.""  It is unclear whether additional suspects were tied to the shootings or whether additional arrests have been made. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more information would be provided in a press conference Thursday.  As authorities continued to investigate, details began to emerge about the man they suspect was behind the shooting.  Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was identified by Canadian officials to their American counterparts as the suspected gunman, multiple U.S. officials told CNN.  Bibeau, who was born in 1982, was a convert to Islam and had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources said.  His passport had been confiscated by Canadian authorities when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The official said it was not clear when that happened.  Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that Bibeau had a record of drug arrests going back 10 years.  'Murdered in cold blood'  Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was ""murdered in cold blood"" as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial, Harper said, expressing condolences to the slain Canadian soldier's family.  The soldier appeared to have been shot in the back, said Peter Henderson, a journalist who was at the memorial at the time of the shooting. Other soldiers who were nearby doing drills at the time ran to help, he said.  Three people brought to The Ottawa Hospital after the shootings have been released, hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told CNN. Earlier, they were described as being in stable condition.  Shortly after the shooting at the memorial, a gunman entered the nearby building on Parliament Hill, officials said.  ""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux told CNN. He was one level below the gunshots.  Gunfire first erupted in the building's foyer. Then a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove told CNN.  Several officers had weapons drawn, he said, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appeared to have been fired by officers at the gunman.  When the shooting ended, a person was lying motionless on the ground near the library entrance, Wingrove said.  Parliament member James Lunney tweeted: #HOC in Lockdown, lone gunman shot security guard, shot his way down Hall of Honor....we are all safe. Gunman dead! Thnk God & our scrty!""  In Twitter posts, several Canadian lawmakers hailed a top security official as a hero, crediting him with shooting the gunman inside Parliament.  ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" Craig Scott, a member of Parliament, wrote.  Another soldier killed Monday  A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism hasn't been ruled out.  On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" killed a Canadian soldier with his car. The man was then shot and killed.  Police: Man who ran down and killed soldier was 'radicalized'  There was no immediate indication that the Monday and Wednesday incidents were related.  In response to the shootings, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, has increased its alert posture, CNN has learned. That means that it has increased the number of planes on a higher alert status ready to respond if needed. NORAD and Canadian authorities are in contact, an official told CNN.  Prime Minister secure during shooting  MP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues. He also tweeted that Prime Minister Harper was secure.  Harper was safely evacuated from the building, tweeted his press secretary, Carl Vallee.  Hours after the Parliament attack, Harper spoke by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama.  ""Obviously, we're all shaken by it,"" Obama later told reporters, ""but we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time.""  Watson said that Wednesday was ""a sad and tragic day for our city and our country.""  ""There's no pain greater than losing a loved one -- to have it happen in such circumstances as this morning is beyond expression, and underlined by a sad anger within my heart,"" he said.  Canada raised its terror threat level  The violence at Parliament comes just days after Canada raised its terror alert Friday.  The suspect in Monday's vehicle attack, Martin Rouleau Couture, reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago. Police arrested him last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP.  ""When he was arrested, he was about to go to Turkey,"" Fontaine said. ""We stopped him as he was about to leave Canada for terrorist actions. He was questioned when he was arrested. We have not been able to determine any real threat at this time.""

pheme_276,0,Five people flee from Sydney cafe amid hostage drama,"Story highlights At least five people have fled the cafe, Seven Network video shows  Police negotiators are in contact with a hostage taker, the official says  Australia's PM says it's unclear whether the violence is politically motivated  Local media carry images of people holding a black flag with Arabic writing  Five people have fled from a cafe in the heart of Sydney where a dramatic hostage taking is unfolding Monday.  But an unknown number of people remain in the cafe, held by at least one armed hostage taker.  Hundreds of police officers have shut down a usually bustling area in Australia's most populous city amid the crisis.  Chilling images from local media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the glass of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district.  Footage showed them holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it that reads: ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God.""  Three people who were seen running out of the cafe ""are now out of the building and they are now with police,"" said New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn, declining to give details about whether they escaped or were let go.  Video from CNN affiliate Seven Network later showed two more people running out of the cafe.  Authorities said many of the details about the situation remained unclear, including the number of people inside the cafe and the motivations of the hostage taker.  ""We don't know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters.

Australia, which is part of the international coalition fighting the terrorist group ISIS in the Middle East, said in September that it had foiled a plot by Islamic militants to carry out a public execution.  New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said it wasn't yet clear whether the situation at the cafe was a terrorist event but that police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert.""  Burn said police negotiators are now in contact with a hostage taker, who appears to have taken staff and customers captive as people were heading to work on Monday morning in the Martin Place area.  Chris Kenny, an editor at The Australian newspaper, said he was at the cafe Monday morning. He left shortly before the siege started.  ""As police quickly swarmed and cleared the area, I turned to see a man against the window, facing out with his hands raised,"" he wrote in his account of the incident. ""At first I was relieved thinking this was the gunman responding to police -- but soon the awful realisation the customers were being forced against the windows.""  Seven Network reported that at least 13 people are being held at the cafe, but Scipione declined to say how many were in there.  Police barricaded off streets and evacuated buildings near the cafe, bringing an eerie quiet to a district typically buzzing with pedestrians and vehicles.  MAP: Sydney CBD  The Martin Place train station was shut down, according to police. They urged people to stay away from the area, but some local office workers gathered at the scene to try to find out what was going on.  The buildings evacuated included the U.S. Consulate General, said Alicia Edwards, a spokeswoman. All personnel have been accounted for, although it's not known whether there are any U.S. citizens among the hostages. U.S. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation."

pheme_98,0,,"John Bacon and Sandra Lee  USA TODAY  SYDNEY -- A tense, 16-hour Australian hostage standoff ended with gunfire when heavily armed police stormed a cafe in the heart of Sydney's financial center. Two hostages and the gunman were killed, authorities said.  Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the dead gunman, a self-styled Islamic cleric, ""was well known to state and commonwealth authorities'' and had ""a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability.''  ""These events do demonstrate that even a country as free, as open, as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence,'' Abbott said Tuesday morning local time in Canberra, the Australian capital.  New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said four of 17 hostages and one police officer were injured.  ""This was an isolated incident,"" he said. ""This should never destroy or change the way of our life.""  One of two hostages killed was Katrina Dawson, 38, a mother of three young children and a lawyer, or barrister as they are called in Australia. Officials said she died of a heart attack en route to a hospital. She had been having coffee with a colleague in the cafe when the gunman took hostages.  The other killed hostage was identified by Sky News as the manager of the Lindt Cafe, Tori Johnson, 34.  ""We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for,'' his family said in a statement. ""We'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support, but the people of Sydney, Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers.''  A close friend of Johnson, Deborah Thomas, told USA TODAY that she learned of his death from Johnson's father shortly after gunfire ended the siege. She said he died trying to overcome the gunman and called him ""a kind, beautiful, gentle man.''  ""My understanding is that in the middle of the night, when the gunman was dozing, Tori went for the gun,'' Thomas said. ""I don't know exactly what happened -- if it went off or the gunman shot him. I do know they tried to revive him.''  ""From a family and friend's perspective, we take comfort knowing that Tori is hailed as one of the heroes, rather than as a victim,'' Thomas said.  Sydney Mayor Clover Moore told CNN that she understood the gunman shot one of the victims and ""that was the catalyst for the police going in.''  Officials said three of the hostage survivors were in stable condition in local hospitals. They included a woman, 75, who had a gunshot wound to the shoulder; a woman, 52, with a gunshot wound to the foot; and a woman, 43, who was shot in the leg. A 39-year-old man was treated and discharged for a facial injury due to gunshots.    After hours of little movement, live TV images showed about six hostages running from the Lindt Chocolat Cafe. Police swarmed the building to the pops of gunfire and smoke grenades. Moments later, one weeping woman was helped out by the officers and at least two other people were wheeled out on stretchers.  Scipione said police moved in when they heard gunshots from the cafe.  ""Incidents unfolding inside the premises led them to believe that now was the time to deploy,"" he said. A 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman were killed in the firefight, Scipione said.  The gunman was identified as Man Haron Monis, 50, an Iranian-born, self-proclaimed Muslim cleric with a lengthy criminal record who had been free on bail.  ""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act. It's a damaged goods individual who's done something outrageous,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the state news agency Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.''  The gunman forced several hostages to make videotapes, which he emailed to Australian media organisations that withheld them from publication at the request of police until the siege was over.  In one of the videoes, surviving hostage Marcia Mikhael, 42, from the Sydney suburb of Glenwood, stood in front of a propaganda flag held aloft by other hostages and repeated Monis's demands.  ""One is for him to get an IS (Islamic State) flag and he will release one hostage,'' Mikhael said. ""And the second one is for the media to inform the other brothers not to explode the other two bombs which are also in the city; there are four bombs all together here.''  ""And the third request is for [Prime Minister] Tony Abbott to contact the brother by a live web, somehow, and he will release five hostages.... We don't understand why his demands haven't been met yet. They are not unreasonable. He is only asking for a flag and a phone call, and that's it.''  ABC reporter Siobhan Heanue said she heard a volley of gunfire and loud explosions followed by screams, then more explosions.  ""The sound ricocheted throughout the tall buildings around the area... and hostages started pouring out of the building,"" she said. ""Some running, some able to walk, some with their hands up, and some being carried by ambulance staff.""  It was not clear how many people were injured. ABC reported that at least three people were seriously hurt.  Earlier, the lone gunman had issued demands and claimed to have bombs scattered around the city, multiple media outlets reported. The gunman also had released videos, through some hostages, stating that he wanted an Islamic State flag and a phone call from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.  Hundreds of heavily armed police officers, many in sniper positions, had taken control of the streets around the cafe in the area of Martin Place downtown.  Five hostages were able to flee to safety in the first several hours of the standoff. An undisclosed number of hostages remained in the cafe until the fiery resolution, police said.  ""We are doing all we can to set you free,"" Scipione had said at a news conference hours after the crisis began. The incident began around 9:45 a.m Monday local time. Sydney is 16 hours ahead of New York.  Australian news media footage had showed people in the cafe, apparently hostages holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it reading, ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God.""  An association of dozens of Australian Muslim groups issued a statement condemning the attack.  ""We reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being, or to still fear or terror into their hearts,"" the statement said. ""We remind everyone that the Arabic inscription on the black flag is not representative of a political statement, but reaffirms a testimony of faith that has been misappropriated by misguided individuals that represent no one but themselves.""  Three people ran out of the cafe six hours into the crisis. About an hour later, two women wearing aprons with the Lindt chocolate logo fled the cafe into the arms of heavily armed police officers.  Kathryn Chee, who works at the cafe, told ABC she had planned to arrive at work early when her mother told her the news of the incident.  She said she saw pictures on TV of hostages with their hands against the windows.  ""Straight away, there were three people that I knew ... my heart just sank,"" she said. 'It's just a little cafe, we have regular customers, people we know their orders … we're already making their order before they get to the counter.""  The Sydney Morning Herald reported that th e gunman forced hostages to call multiple news media outlets to outline his demands, and that the hostages also posted his demands on their social media accounts.  The standoff gripped downtown Sydney, shutting down government offices, public transit and schools as it dragged through the day. The normally busy and crowded business district of the city was on virtual lockdown.  Australia raised its terror warning level in September in response to a domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. At the time, one man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.  Meanwhile in Belgium on Monday, police detained three men after reports of a hostage taking in an apartment building in the western city of Ghent. No one was injured in the incident.  Federal police spokeswoman Annemie Serlippens excluded any political or terror motive. Police, who blocked off a wide perimeter around the area, said it was still unclear whether they had taken any hostages.  Bacon reported from McLean, Va.; Contributing: William M.

Cristiano,0,No car crash charge for Ronaldo,"The player was questioned by officers as part of the investigation  Cristiano Ronaldo will face no charges after crashing his Ferrari in a tunnel near Manchester Airport.  The 24-year-old winger, who is set to join Real Madrid in an £80m deal, wrote off the £200,000 car when he crashed into a roadside barrier in January.  The front edge of the red sports car was demolished and one of the wheels came off, but Ronaldo escaped unhurt.  After investigating the incident and interviewing the forward, police have decided not to take action.  The crash happened on the A538 Altrincham Road, between Wilmslow and Hale, Cheshire, at about 1020 GMT on 8 January.  One of the wheels of the red Ferrari 599 GTB came off and ended up about 200 yards behind the crash scene.  The Ferrari 599 GTB was written off in the crash  Ronaldo, who remains a Manchester United player pending his move, was interviewed at the scene and later provided a written statement.  On Tuesday, a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said: ""No further action will be taken against the driver of a Ferrari 599 GTB, which collided with a wall on the A538 Wilmslow Road on Thursday January 8.  ""No-one was injured and no other vehicles were involved in the incident.""  Manchester United announced last week they had accepted a world-record bid for the Portuguese winger.  United want the deal to be concluded by 30 June and Ronaldo could make his Real debut in a friendly in Ireland."
pheme_399,0,"Soldier killed at National War Memorial mourned as caring father, animal lover","The Canadian Forces reservist shot and killed while standing guard at the National War Memorial was a proud soldier, an animal lover and fitness fanatic from Hamilton, Ont.  Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo was taking a turn as part of this fall’s Ceremonial Guard watching over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier when he was gunned down shortly after 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.  Cirillo proudly posted photographs to social media dressed in his military fatigues, as well as a snap of his Department of National Defence identification card.  He posted a photograph of his unit -- The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise’s), an infantry reserve unit based in Hamilton – to Instagram, showing them in full gear in an unnamed forested location. He dubbed it a “family photo,” and included the hashtags #brothers.  A profile picture from Instagram shows Cirillo wearing a t-shirt from Goodlife Fitness. Other photos showed him mid-workout, doing knuckle push-ups and handstands.  Other Instagram photos of his dogs had hashtags like #puppy #love.  Hamilton, Ont. Mayor Bob Bratina said that Cirillo was also a father to a young child.  A community memorial Facebook page in Cirillo’s name was established late Wednesday afternoon. By 11 p.m. ET, the page had nearly 70,000 “likes.”  “How very sad and poignant that this young soldier died while standing guard at our national monument near the grave of the unknown soldier,” one commenter, Garth Cramer, posted on the page.  “Rest in Peace trooper, and let your death remind us of the sacrifices of all the men and women in uniform who stand on guard and defend our country.”  Another commenter echoed the sentiments of many Canadians by saying she did not know Cirillo, “but I’m so proud of his service and sacrifice.  “Thank you.”  Many commenters thanked Cirillo for his service, while a handful told Cirillo to “stand easy, brother.”  Images posted to social media showed police cars blocking street access to Cirillo’s family home in Hamilton.  Mourners placed flowers outside the Hamilton armoury where Cirillo trained with his unit as friends remembered the 24-year-old.  Carissa Perron, who grew up with Cirillo and remained friends with him said she didn’t want to believe the news.  “He was an awesome person,” Perron said. “He always had a smile on his face no matter what situation he was in.”  Perron said she asked Cirillo not to join the Canadian Forces because she didn’t want him to get hurt.  “But he was adamant about doing it and not quitting,” she said.  The Canadian Army had just resumed responsibility for guarding the Tomb on Monday, taking over from the Royal Canadian Navy as part of the National Sentry program. The Army is to be on duty at the monument in the days leading up to Remembrance Day ceremonies on Nov. 11.  The National Sentry Program “reinforces the Canadian commitment to remember and honour Canadians who served in both World Wars, as well as those who have contributed to Canada’s long standing tradition of military excellence through to the present day,” reads a description of the program on the federal government’s website.  “The sentries reinforce public awareness that the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is to be treated with dignity, tribute and respect.”  Hamilton, Ont. Mayor Bob Bratina said Wednesday’s events have made this a terrible day for Canada, and Hamilton now has to take its place among many mourners.”  Witnesses at the Memorial told CTV News that that they heard a gunshot after 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, followed by a second shot before seeing a soldier in full dress uniform fall to the ground.  Video taken at the scene showed emergency services workers surrounding the soldier and performing CPR before loading him onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.  Ottawa Police confirmed early Wednesday afternoon that the soldier had died after being taken to The Ottawa Hospital.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones,” read a police service statement.  Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told reporters that today “is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country.”  He offered his “heartfelt condolences” to the soldier’s loved ones, and asked residents to keep his sacrifice in their thoughts.  “Today, I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial,” Watson said. “Remember that one person’s life has been taken from us, from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”  Ed Hughes, a veteran who laid a wreath outside the Hamilton Armoury after hearing of the soldier’s death, told reporters “it broke my heart” to learn he was a member of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.  “Because these are just kids that are looking for the honour in life, how to be a man, and that’s why they join,” Hughes said. “And to end up being shot, so cowardly, while protecting the Unknown Soldier. It’s a shame.”  Both regular and reserve members of the Armed Forces from across the country take a turn serving in the Ceremonial Guard, which performs public duties around Ottawa.  The Ceremonial Guard was established in 1959, and today is made up of more than 400 soldiers.  A picture of the group that took over guard duties at the War Memorial on Monday shows 20 soldiers in dress uniform standing behind the tomb. They represent the following units:  2 Royal Canadian Regiment (Gagetown)  4th Artillery Regiment (General Support), RCA (Gagetown)  3rd Field Artillery Regiment (The Loyal Company), RCA (Saint John, N.B.)  Governor General’s Horse Guards (Toronto)  Governor General’s Foot Guards (Ottawa)  The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise’s) (Hamilton)  1st Battalion, The Nova Scotia Highlanders (North) (Truro)  5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown  Ceremonial Guard  The soldiers were scheduled to perform sentry duty daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Remembrance Day."

pheme_248,0,Kunstmuseum Bern Accepts Gurlitt Collection,"At a joint press conference in Berlin on Monday, the Kunstmuseum Bern and the German government announced that the Swiss museum will accept the trove of artworks bequeathed to it by the late collector Cornelius Gurlitt. Many among the nearly 1,300 works of art—which include pieces by Henri Matisse, Max Liebermann, Otto Dix, and Marc Chagall—are suspected of having been looted by the Nazis. Kunstmuseum Bern president Christoph Schaeublin made assurances that his institution would make every effort to return those works to their rightful heirs, when announcing his board’s decision.  According to the agreement, all of the works will remain in Germany until questions surrounding their provenance can be cleared up. The task force has said that the process will now stretch until 2015, possibly beyond (see “Gurlitt Taskforce Will Miss Restitution Deadline“). Schaeublin noted that this fulfills the agreement that was reached between German authorities and Gurlitt before his death, which provided for full research in the provenance of works in the collection and the return of those found to have been looted by the Nazi regime. He also confirmed that a full list of works included in the collection would be published as soon as Tuesday, a move which has been requested since the collection’s discovery was made public and is expected to assist potential heirs in locating their works.  The German government will also pay for all legal costs associated with future legal claims against the museum with regard to the Gurlitt collection. Earlier this month, Jewish World Congress president Ronald Lauder cautioned that the Kunstmuseum Bern would be opening itself up to an “avalanche” of lawsuits if the institution was to accept the collection, speculating that numerous heirs would subsequently come forward and attempt to restitute works from Gurlitt’s former holdings (see “Ronald Lauder Warns of Lawsuit “Avalanche” over Gurlitt Collection“). He warned that the Kunstmuseum Bern “would become a museum of stolen art” by accepting the works.  Discovered in 2012  Just over one year ago, the world learned of the monumental trove of Nazi looted art found by tax authorities in Cornelius Gurlitt’s Munich apartment and later at a residence in Salzburg. The hoard was discovered in 2012, following suspicions that Gurlitt was evading taxes. Works suspected to have been looted by the Nazis have since been placed on the central register for all artworks suspected of having been stolen, Lost Art. Gurlitt died on May 6th of this year and left a will, which bequeathed the entire collection to the Swiss museum (see “Gurlitt Bequeathed Collection to Museum of Fine Arts Bern“).  Representatives of heirs who spoke to artnet News said that the restitution process was hobbled by the bequest despite conclusions by the German task force that the works—some of the collection’s most prominent—should be returned to their rightful heirs.  Legal representatives for 88-year-old David Toren, who escaped Nazi Germany at the age of 14, expressed their approval of the decision to artnet News, ahead of its official announcement. “It’s certainly good news for my client,” said Toren’s attorney August Matteis, “because this will most likely end the log jam that has kept the painting out of Mr. Toren’s hands up until now.” The German task force determined that Toren was the rightful heir of Max Liebermann’s Two Riders on the Beach (1901) in August (see “Gurlitt Task Force Sides with Nazi Victim“). The painting had been stolen from the Breslau villa of Toren’s great uncle, David Friedman.  Despite that verdict, little headway had apparently been made to return the painting in the several months since the task force’s decision. Now, according to Matteis, “There’s absolutely no reason for any further delay […] They should have given [the painting] back a lot sooner, from our perspective, obviously. But now there really are no further obstacles in the way.”  Matisse’s Sitting Woman Restitution  Speaking to artnet News directly after Monday’s announcement, Art Recovery International founder Christopher Marinello, who represents the family of lauded art dealer Paul Rosenberg, said “We are extremely grateful to the museum for taking on this responsibility, accepting the bequest and pledging their adherence to Washington Principles.” He noted that there are still several steps ahead before his clients would receive Matisse’s Sitting Woman, but added “The lawyer for the museum and I have been in contact,” and had already begun the paperwork necessary to complete a successful restitution. Marinello believes it is “only a matter of time” before an official date for that to occur can be set.  The museum’s decision to accept the collection comes just three days after Gurlitt’s cousin, Uta Werner, is said to have filed papers in a Munich court contesting the validity of the art collector’s will and thus the ability for the Kunstmuseum to accept his bequest. However, it appears that German authorities do not expect the last minute legal action to hold water.  The legal challenge would place Werner and several other relatives in charge of the collection. It follows the leak of results from a psychological assessment of Gurlitt, shortly before his death, that was ordered by Werner and fellow cousin, Dietrich Gurlitt. The assessment concluded that Gurlitt “suffered from mild dementia, a schizophrenic personality disorder, and a delusional disorder,” at the time of the will’s writing and thus was potentially unfit to make the bequest (see “Gurlitt Was Mentally Unfit to Write Will, Cousins Claim“). According to the AP, the cousins’ challenge of the will would have to be concluded before the collection would be able to depart for Switzerland.  Regardless of that outcome, Art Recovery’s Marinello believes that the works will be returned to their rightful heirs. “We have been contacted by the representative of Gurlitt’s heirs,” including those who filed the claim on Friday, “and their statements are that they will return works that have been looted.” He does, however, note that such a process would have likely been more lengthy than it will with the Kunstmuseum Bern, assuming all goes as announced on Monday.

Tonight, we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these despicable attacks.  Fellow Canadians, we've also been reminded today of the compassionate and courageous nature of so many Canadians -- like those private citizens and first responders who came to provide aid to Cpl. Cirillo as he fought for his life.  And, of course, the members of our security forces — in the RCMP, the City of Ottawa police and in Parliament — who came quickly and at great risk to themselves to assist those of us who were close to the attack.  Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had. But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.  We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values. on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.  But let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home, just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.  While today has been without question a difficult day, I have every confidence that Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our country through many challenges.  Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us. For now, Laureen and Ben and Rachel and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched by today's attack. May God bless them and keep our land glorious and free.""  NDP Leader Tom Mulcair  Opposition speaks about Ottawa shooting News 5:38 Raw video from Tom Mulcair 5:38  [The first four and a half lines of the text below are from prepared remarks that were not caught on video in the CBC broadcast above.]  ""Good evening my fellow Canadians. Today the peace of our nation's capital was shattered by an act of hatred and brutality -- cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, at the heart of who we are.  But I'm here tonight in solidarity, side-by-side with my colleagues, with our Prime Minister and with all Canadians.  This attack struck with sudden and deadly violence. It was carried out on the very ground where we come together to exchange ideas with the knowledge that whatever our differences, we will always resolve them peacefully.  It was intended to make us more fearful of our neighbours and less confident in ourselves. But it has failed. Today's events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer, in making us stronger.  And to the brave women and men of law enforcement, our security services and our Canadian Forces, I want to say that your determination, your professionalism and, indeed, your heroism today will not soon be forgotten.  Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone here in our nation's capital are with the family and loved ones of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Forces member from Hamilton, Ont., who lost his life this morning — the second in just a few days.  Cpl. Cirillo was literally standing on guard at a monument dedicated to the sacrifice of others who came before him. To his family and friends, I tell you that 35 million Canadians at home and abroad from coast to coast to coast and around the world stand with you tonight, and we will not forget.  In this moment, Canadians are unified in grief and stricken with disbelief. Canada is shaken today, but we shall not waver. We woke up this morning in a country blessed by love, diversity and peace, and tomorrow, we will do the same.  These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate. They will not. We will stand up, we will stand together. We will persevere, and we will prevail.  Good evening.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau  Liberal leader speaks about Ottawa shooting News 10:18 Raw video from Justin Trudeau 10:18  ""My fellow Canadians: I’m speaking to you from a Parliament Hill just coming out of lockdown. I am deeply saddened by today’s horrific events here in Ottawa and unreservedly condemn these brutal and heartless acts of violence. This attack is unforgivable. Should any other perpetrators or co-conspirators exist, they must be caught and be punished to the full force of our laws.  I’ve extended an offer of full support to the government along with any assistance members of our party can provide at this time. My thoughts and prayers, along with those of my colleagues, go out to the family and friends of the victims of today’s horrific shooting, including Cpl. Nathan Frank Cirillo, who was standing dutifully, guarding one of our nation’s most sacred monuments.  It was a cowardly act — an unarmed man was murdered in cold blood, at close range. Words cannot express this deep sadness we feel over his loss. To the brave women and men who rushed to the scene to confront the shooter and to help keep us safe, I say only, 'Thank you. Thank you for your selfless courage and your professionalism in this time of crisis.'  In the days that follow, there will be questions, anger and perhaps confusion. This is natural, but we cannot let this get the better of us. Losing ourselves to fear and speculation is the intention of those who commit these heinous acts. They mean to shake us. We will remain resolved. They want us to forget ourselves. Instead, we will remember. We will remember who we are.  We are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.  Our dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.  Criminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.  Today, some speak of the loss of innocence in Canada. This is inaccurate. Canada is not and has never been innocent to the threats we face. And we know, as we have always known, that we are not immune. What is true is that we have never let those threats shape us, and we have never bowed to those who mean to undermine our values and our way of life. We have remained Canadians, and this is how we will carry on.  We will get answers to how and why this happened. They will be vital in preventing any future attack. And to our friends and fellow citizens in the Muslim community, Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of your faith. Continued mutual co-operation and respect will help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.  We will walk forward together, not apart.  In the coming days, we will be inundated with pictures and videos showing what happened today. But there is one in particular we should all remember: the picture in our minds we have of Canadians helping and protecting Canadians. That is who we truly are, and it is who we shall continue to be.  Good night."""

Chilling footage has emerged of a female hostage apparently trying to communicate with police by miming her throat being cut - while news channels have chosen not to broadcast a video of another hostage relaying the assailant's demands.  For the latest details as another group of hostages escapes, follow this link.  Worker (L) flees cafe and suspected gunman (R). Pics: Channel 9, Channel 7  Witnesses described seeing the hostages looking ""exhausted"" and ""absolutely petrified"".  But as night fell and the siege entered its 16th hour, the gunman, who has been named as Sheikh Man Haron Monis, turned off the lights, making it difficult to see what is going on inside the cafe.  Play video ""Hostage Makes Throat Slitting Sign"" Video: Hostage Makes Throat Slitting Sign  Up to 100 armed police are at the scene while negotiators talk to the hostage taker.  New South Wales Police commissioner Andrew Scipione had this message for those inside: ""Rest assured we are doing all we can to set you free. We will be looking after your safety as our number one priority.""  :: Follow live updates of the siege  The siege began at 10am (local time) when Monis - who was previously known to both Sydney police and media - entered the Lindt cafe in Martin Place carrying a pump-action shotgun.  Shortly afterwards, hostages were seen holding a black flag with white Arabic text similar to those displayed by Islamic State.

Police are investigating reports Monis has used hostages' social media accounts to demand a meeting with Australian Prime Minster Tony Abbott.  Some of the hostages have spoken to their families on mobile phones - while five, three male customers and two female staff, have managed to escape.  Journalist Chris Reason, who has a view of the cafe from the Channel 7 building, said the gunman was ""extremely agitated"" when the hostages fled.  1 / 49 Gallery: Latest Images From Australia A bomb disposal robot moves towards Sydney's Lindt Cafe after armed police moved in to end the seige in a barrage of gunfire.

""We can see very little of what is going on inside, which is obviously not good news,"" said Mr Reason.  ""From our position over the last couple of hours we have counted 15 hostages in total.

pheme_95,0,Ottawa Chaos: Soldier Killed in Canadian Capital Shooting,"A Canadian soldier guarding the National War Memorial in Ottawa was shot and killed Wednesday, and a burst of gunfire minutes later terrorized Parliament and sent lawmakers scrambling for safety.  Sources identified the gunman to NBC News as Michael Joseph Hall, 32, a convert to Islam who was using the name Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. He was confirmed dead. The victim was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton, Ontario, a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, one of Canada's largest reserve units.  Authorities told NBC News they believe Hall had a string of low-level criminal offenses in the past but that they had uncovered no links in the U.S. with anyone being watched in connection with terrorism investigations.  RELATED: Who Is the Canadian Parliament Shooter?  Few other details of either man were available, and confusion continued to grip Canada's capital well into the evening. As members of Parliament remained locked down on Parliament Hill 8½ hours later, police couldn't say whether anyone was still on the loose or what the motive might have been.  But Prime Minister Stephen Harper — who was on Parliament Hill when the first shots were fired — didn't hesitate to call the gunman ""the terrorist,"" saying in a nationally televised address Wednesday night that the attack was proof that ""Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks that we have seen elsewhere around the world.""  Chairs are piled up against the door in the Conservative Party caucus room after shooting began Wednesday on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario. Nina Grewal / Reuters  The attack came at a time of heightened concern about terrorism in Canada. On Monday, a man described as a radical Islamic convert ran down two Canadian soldiers with his car, killing one of them.  NBC News reported this week that Canadian officials have been concerned about the potential for knife and gun attacks, including strikes against military personnel, because of the nation's involvement in international fight against ISIS.  The attack paralyzed the center of the Canadian government after the first shots were fired just before 10 a.m. ET. For hours, there was confusion about the number of shooters. Ottawa police Constable Marc Soucy told MSNBC at midafternoon: ""We're not sure how many suspects there are. We're still actively looking.""  There were also reports of shots fired at a nearby mall, the Rideau Centre, but police said nothing had happened there.  Ottawa Hospital said it treated and released three patients for minor injuries.  Cirillo was standing guard across the street from Parliament at the War Memorial, a tall granite cenotaph adorned with bronze figures representing Canadians who fought in World War I.  Ok so we were on a tour at that war monument in Ottawa a few minutes ago, a few seconds later there was a shooting.. pic.twitter.com/yzCtBlGZ2v — Evanem (@kamakazi19982) October 22, 2014  Sen. Jim Munson, a retired journalist who represents Ontario, told MSNBC that his wife, who drove him to work in the morning, may have seen the gunman approach Cirillo as she returned home.  Munson said that his wife saw a car stop in heavy traffic in front of the memorial and that she watched a man carrying a bundle in blankets toward the site, followed by a bright flash. He said his wife believed that it was the gunman and that he was carrying a rifle or rifles in the blanket.  A few minutes later, inside Parliament about a third of a mile away, a volley of gunfire could be heard for about 10 seconds in a video posted online by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. Sen. George Baker, a member of Parliament, told MSNBC from his office, where he was holed up, that about 50 shots had been fired.  Tyrone Benskin, a member of Parliament representing part of Montreal, said he was in a weekly caucus meeting when ""we heard pops.""  Benskin told MSNBC the pops ""initially sounded like something metallic being dropped in the hallway,"" which is made of granite and echoes loudly. He and fellow caucus members were hustled to a secure location in the building, where they remained for hours, he said.  Soucy, of the Ottawa police, told MSNBC that witness descriptions of the shooter or shooters ranged from people ""wearing a scarf around their head to dressed in all black, so we're looking at everyone.""  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police urged people in downtown Ottawa to stay away from windows and roofs. Baker, the member of Parliament, said that he could see about 100 armed officers circling the building.  Police and military officials clarified little at an afternoon news conference. They asked people to stay away from the center of downtown and be vigilant, but they couldn't say whether a suspect remained at large. They also couldn't say what kind of gun was used.  Amid the uncertainty, members of Parliament paced the room with phones pressed to their ears, talking to staff members they were separated from. Cafeteria staff made the circuit handing out coffee and sandwiches.  The shooting came days after Canada raised its domestic terrorism threat level. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it was watching at least 90 known ISIS sympathizers. And the FBI has been working closely with Canadian authorities as both countries watch for threats against their citizens.  ""This is exactly, again, what intelligence officials have been worried about,"" said Michael Leiter, former director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center and an NBC News analyst.  In the car attack Monday, authorities identified the attacker to NBC News as Martin Rouleau, 25, a radical Muslim who may have acted alone but had links to other suspected fundamentalists. One soldier died, and the other was injured. The suspect was shot by police and later died.  Authorities were monitoring him and had revoked his passport before the attack.  In the attack Wednesday, an Instagram user, Amer Adas, posted video of paramedics loading someone into an ambulance and of police with weapons drawn:  A U.S. Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News that there was ""no specific reporting"" to indicate a threat to the U.S., the attack reverberated there, as well. The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down, and The Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery in the Virginia suburbs of Washington increased security. NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canadian air command, went on high alert. New York police said they would assign ""special attention"" to certain locations.  President Barack Obama, who spoke by phone with Harper, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that while it was too early to know what motivated the shootings, he had assigned his national security team to work closely with Canadian authorities because the long U.S.-Canadian border could ""factor in to ongoing efforts to counter terror attacks in our country.""  In Toronto, the largest city in Canada, police said they knew of no specific threat, but they ordered stepped-up patrols at City Hall, courthouses and other government facilities and on the subway.  Two events honoring the Pakistani teenager and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban two years ago for promoting education for girls, were canceled.

politifact938,0,Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval,"WASHINGTON  Even though federal health officials have begun a criminal investigation into whether the Peanut Corporation of America deliberately sold contaminated products, the government still needed the company’s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products.  The wording of the recall statement had to be approved by the company before the Food and Drug Administration could publish it under current rules. The agency relies on cooperation from food makers to ensure the safety of the food supply even when those makers are suspected of crimes.  Some Democrats in Congress have vowed to change this by giving the F.D.A. more authority, and the agency’s critics say it is too timid with the power it has.  On Monday, President Obama promised a “complete review of F.D.A. operations.”  “I think that the F.D.A. has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch,” Mr. Obama said in an interview on the “Today” show."
pheme_361,0,Cpl. Nathan Cirillo dreamed of becoming full-time soldier,"The opening shots that began a devastating day on Parliament Hill killed a Hamilton reservist who dreamed of being a full-time soldier and deprived his kindergarten-aged son of his father.  Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot while on honorary guard at the National War Memorial. Ottawa Police announced hours after the shooting that the soldier shot at the memorial had died.  He would later be identified as Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment. Cirillo died a short time after the attack despite frantic efforts to revive him at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  Lt.-Col. Lawrence Hatfield of the Argylls made a brief statement on Wednesday night to reporters and members of the public who gathered outside the James Street armoury.  ""The regiment wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family of Cpl. Cirillo as well as to express our thanks that's been demonstrated by the support of Canadians across this country,"" he said. ""Cpl. Cirillo was a very proud member of the Argylls and the Highlanders of Canada. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and we hope that Canadians share that with us.""  Jim Cirillo, uncle of the deceased, said his nephew persevered and achieved great things after a sometimes difficult upbringing. (CBC)  Back in East Hamilton, the news spread through his extended the family. A distraught uncle, Jim Cirillo, answered the door to his Barton Street East home with swollen eyes, a TV locked on the 24-hour news cycle of the unfolding events, and a computer opened to a picture of his nephew, Nathan. Between tears, he pointed at the picture on the screen. He said his sister-in-law and mother to Nathan, Kathy, couldn’t believe the news.  “She's saying she doesn't believe it … She went on the internet and she saw it and she … I don't know how she didn't pass out.  “She's just completely broken, broken right now.""  Jim Cirillo said Nathan and his two sisters weren't ""dealt a good hand,"" with a difficult divorce splitting up their parents.  ""And now for him to get shot and pass away, I don't know if life is fair … he didn't deserve that,"" he said. ""I don't know how someone could have picked him out and do that.""  Joined cadets at 13  Along with Hamilton Police Chief Glenn De Caire, Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina visited the family and told reporters outside the armoury where Cirillo joined as a cadet when he was 13 years old that he expects the fallen soldier to have a funeral with “full service honours.”  ""It was very sad but there was some comfort in being with Chief De Caire, who has experience with dealing with sudden loss of life,"" Bratina said. ""We had some hugs and tears. One young boy walked in and said to his aunt, I believe it was, 'I saw you crying.'""  Bratina said Cirillo had two sisters, and was part of ""a typical Hamilton family. Beautiful home. Clean as a whip. Pictures of Nathan and his two sisters on the wall. It was the kind of place that any of us would feel right at home going into.""  Jim Cirillo confirmed that Nathan's father has been in Costa Rica for several years. Nathan had tried to reconnect with his father a few years ago, and had recently reconnected with his mother. She will be taking care of his son, Marcus, who just entered kindergarten, and his two dogs. The child's mother, who had the baby while Cirillo was still a teenager, is no longer in the picture.  Cirillo was a personal trainer, former Good Life fitness employee and bouncer at a downtown Hamilton bar, Club Absinthe.  Manager Billy Pozeg said he would often come straight from the armoury in his fatigues, and change at the club before his shifts, joking he would go from one service job to another. He added Cirillo would bring up the mood in a room with a smile as wide as his shoulders, adding his dream was to be a full-time member of the military.  His pictures posted on Facebook and Instagram show a man always smiling, who played guitar and loved his two large dogs. He posed for tourists shortly before he was attacked.  'Communication lockdown'  A source who asked not to be identified told CBC News in Hamilton that members from the unit have all been ordered not to speak about the incident.  Nathan Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, said Cirillo owned two German Shepherds. (Instagram)  ""They are now all on communication lockdown,"" the source said. ""They’ve been told to put their phones away and all bases are all locked down.""  Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, has been trying to make sense of the news all day. She first realized Cirillo had been shot when pictures of paramedics trying to save his life was shown on television Wednesday morning.  ""I saw his face and it was him,"" Michele said. ""That's how I found out it was Nathan.  ""Nathan was a good man. He would give anything to anyone,"" she said. ""He was there for everyone.""  Police have set up a roadblock around the Cirillo family's home in east Hamilton while they decide who will be their spokesperson.  Members of Canada’s Muslim community offered condolences to the family, condemning the attack.  “The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Canada categorically and unequivocally condemns this morning’s terror attacks on the Canadian Parliament and the National War Memorial as well as on the Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec,” the organization said in a statement released Wednesday. “These acts of terror have no basis in any religion.”  The Argylls are an infantry unit of the Canadian Forces primary reserves within 31 Canadian Brigade Group. It is one of the largest army reserve units in the country with over 250 soldiers.  'It broke my heart'  Retired Col. Geordie Elms said Hamilton’s Highland regiment served in the first two World Wars, as well as Afghanistan, contributing more manpower than any other militia in Ontario. He knew it was an Argyll when he saw the uniform.  “It was terrible anyway. Then it became clear where this had taken place. That’s a ceremonial duty that goes to commemorating our history,” Elms said. “It’s tragic that it’s one of our Argylls.”  On average, Elms said a reservist dedicates one night a week and one weekend a month to it. Every year, there’ll be a concentrated exercise where it might be a week or 10 days.  Elms said the greatest single force of reservist recruits is still students, because of the nature of the work and the potential to do training during the summer period.  A man in an Argylls jacket places flowers in memory of soldier Nathan Cirillo outside the gates of the John Weir Foote Armoury, the home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, in Hamilton. (Aaron Lynett/Canadian Press)  “For this particular task to guard the War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they would have put out a notice and he would have answered it,” Elms said. “It’s an honour and a privilege to do that duty, just as it would be if you were to be part of the ceremonial guard on Parliament Hill in the summertime. It’s a sought-after task. It’s not a task they have any trouble filling.”  The soldiers who were guarding the National War Memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and full-time and part-time soldiers are rotated through duty on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They carry rifles that aren't loaded.  CBC News has obtained a copy of an email directed to student soldiers with the Armed Forces telling them not to wear their uniforms, even on base.  Another email sent to military personnel authorized the wearing of uniforms on base, as well as inside their cars while travelling between the base and their homes, but that they should avoid wearing their uniforms in all other cases. The email also instructed military personnel in uniform not to make any stops — not even at gas stations, daycares, schools and elsewhere — while travelling between their base and home.  At the armoury in Hamilton, non-uniformed people were passing in and out of the gates, with uniformed guards standing watch at each side. People have been bringing flowers and notices of condolences to the building.  Veteran Ed Hughes dropped off a cross to the armoury Wednesday. ""I was injured in service,"" he said. ""It broke my heart when I found out he was from Hamilton. It broke my heart he was a Sutherland."""

According to Chan, “Crows are known for aggressively harassing other raptors that are much bigger in size when spotted in their territories and usually these ‘intruders’ simply retreat without much fuss. However, in this frame the crow did not seem to harass the bald eagle at such close proximity and neither did the bald eagle seem to mind the crow’s presence invading its personal space. What made it even more bizarre was that the crow even made a brief stop on the back of the eagle as if it was taking a free scenic ride and the eagle simply obliged.”  As strange as this photo may be, it’s not the first time that such a rare and unexpected sight has been spotted by a photographer – check out the baby weasel that took a ride on this woodpecker!

pheme_168,0,Federal sources confirm identity of slain Ottawa gunman,"  Bruce Cheadle, The Canadian Press      OTTAWA -- A gunman turned the nation's capital into an armed camp Wednesday after he fatally shot an honour guard at ""point-blank"" range at the National War Memorial before setting his sights on Parliament Hill.  The extraordinary scene ended with the assailant shot dead in the polished marble halls of Parliament's Centre Block, apparently by the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, while SWAT teams combed the busy parliamentary precinct in an ultimately fruitless search for accomplices.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper capped the day's stunning events with a rare live televised address, calling the tragedy a terrorist attack that he said would only redouble Canada's efforts to combat fight terrorism at home and abroad.  Slain reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton, Ont., is the second member of the Armed Forces this week to die in an apparently random, murderous attack, just as Canadian war planes are being deployed to Iraq.  Two Canadian soldiers were run over -- one of them fatally -- in Quebec on Monday by a man with jihadist sympathies.  The slain shooter was identified as Michael Zehaf Bibeau, born in 1982 and known to police in Montreal and Vancouver.  ""It's way too early to be able to determine a motive,"" Gilles Michaud, the assistant commissioner of the RCMP, said at a news conference in Ottawa while police were still clearing downtown buildings.  But the prime minister, who was in the Centre Block addressing a Conservative caucus meeting when the attack began just outside the door, later took to the national airwaves to unequivocally characterize the shooter's true motives.  ""Fellow Canadians, in the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,"" Harper said.  ""But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.""  Attacks on Canadian security personnel and governing institutions, he said, are ""by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.""  Tony Zobl, 35, witnessed Cirillo being gunned down at the War Memorial from his fourth-floor office window directly above the monument, just before 10 a.m. Wednesday.  ""I looked out the window and saw a shooter -- a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well -- holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph, point blank, twice,"" Zobl told The Canadian Press.  ""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun,"" he continued. ""The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""  Zobl said the shooter then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.  It was only earlier this year that the government extended the season for live guards at the monument through the November Remembrance Day ceremonies. In the past, the honour guard has stood down after Labour Day.  The scene on Parliament Hill was frantic.  Wednesday morning is the busiest day of the week on the Hill, with MPs and senators of all major parties gathering in the Centre Block for meetings.  Given the time and day, it was remarkable only four persons were admitted to hospital. One was Cirillo, and the other three were all released Wednesday evening. Only one had a minor gunshot wound.  Witnesses and video suggest a hail of gunfire erupted in the marbled Hall of Honour that bisects the building directly beneath the Peace Tower.  Kevin Vickers, better known to political wonks as the ceremonially garbed sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace to open the Commons each day, was reported by multiple sources as the person who shot the gunman.  Construction worker Scott Walsh said he was in a manhole near the East Block building, between the memorial and the Centre Block, when he heard two gunshots echo down the street.  In the ensuing panic, people around him started screaming, including a woman pushing a child in a stroller.  He said she started to run, so he went to help her.  That's when he saw a man with long black hair, his face covered by a white scarf with decals on it and wearing a black jacket.  ""He had a double-barrelled shotgun, he was about five feet from me, and he ran right beside us, ran past the woman with the stroller and child,"" he said.  The gunman then hijacked a car at gunpoint, he said, and drove it up towards the Peace Tower.  Greta Levy, a press secretary for the NDP, said she had just left the building when she saw the gunman walk up the paved ramp under the tower.  ""None of us reacted at first but then we heard a security guard yelling, 'There's a gun, get down, get down, there's a gun,""' Levy said.  ""And I looked up, as did the woman I was with, and saw a man that I would describe as young, 20s-30s, coming up the ramp as though to go in the main doors of Centre Block under the Peace Tower.""  The incident paralyzed the entire downtown core for hours, from the adjacent U.S. embassy to the University of Ottawa several city blocks to the south.  Sources say police at one point worried there could be up to five assailants, and they combed rooftops of nearby buildings in addition to the full lockdown.  The incident shattered the sleepy tenor of a capital that has been remarkably immune from attack through more than a decade of tumultuous overseas wars.  ""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" senior cabinet minister Tony Clement posted on Twitter while locked in the caucus room. ""Hug your fam.""  ""It's a stomach-turning, shocking day for all Canadians,"" Marc Garneau, a former Forces member and now Liberal foreign affairs critic, said in an interview.  The Hill is known as an open public space that's used for everything from mass yoga classes to hazy pot-legalization demonstrations.  ""I think the intention was to try to make Parliament not look like Fort Knox,"" said Garneau. ""But we've crossed a river today.""  Green party Leader Elizabeth May urged restraint.  ""Today is not a day that 'changes everything,""' May said in a statement. ""It is a day of tragedy. We must ensure we keep our responses proportionate to whatever threat remains.""  Military bases have been put on alert and soldiers have been cautioned about wearing uniforms in public.  In Toronto, the country's largest city, extra police where put on the streets and public buildings were on alert.  Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist from the Netherlands, was at the War Memorial and able to describe the shooter in detail.  ""We heard four shots,"" said Lugtenborg.  ""You don't expect that when you're on holiday in Canada.""  - With files from Jennifer Ditchburn, Steve Rennie, Jim Bronskill, Murray Brewster, Stephanie Levitz, Joan Bryden, Andy Blatchford and Lina Dib."
pheme_345,0,Terror grips Ottawa: Gunman was flagged as ‘high risk’,"Terror gripped the Canadian capital of Ottawa on Wednesday when a convert to Islam shot and killed a soldier guarding the National War Memorial before storming the packed Parliament building, where he was gunned down in a hail of police bullets.  The armed assault, which put Parliament and much of Ottawa on lockdown, came as Canada was already in a heightened state of alert over an attack just two days earlier, when another jihad convert intentionally ran down two Canadian Armed Forces soldiers with his car in Quebec, killing one of them.  Wednesday’s terror attack began when a black-clad man wearing a hoodie and a bandanna appeared at the memorial at 9:52 a.m. and opened fire on the soldier, who was carrying only an unloaded ceremonial rifle.  “All of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle . . . and just pow, pow,” said a bystander, Raivo Nommick.  The soldier, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, of Hamilton, Ontario, died despite first responders’ desperate attempts to save him.  The 24-year-old father was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment.  The shooter was identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, a drug-addled recent convert to Islam who had been on Canadian authorities’ radar. Sources told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was designated a “high-risk traveler” and his passport had been seized, suggesting that authorities were wary that he might travel to join foreign jihadis like ISIS.  In other developments:  Authorities released a photograph showing Zehaf-Bibeau posing with a pointed rifle on a since-deleted ISIS media account. They were trying to determine whether the gunman acted alone or was part of a terror plot.  The NYPD beefed up patrols at the Consulate General of Canada in Midtown as a precaution.  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke to his nation Wednesday night declaring, “Let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve . . . [and we will] redouble our efforts to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries.”  President Obama said, “I expressed on behalf of the American people our condolences to the [slain soldier’s] family and to the Canadian people as a whole.. Obviously, we are all shaken . . . but we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that we’re standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time.”  British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted, “I’m appalled by today’s attack in Ottawa.”  After shooting Cirillo, Zehaf-Bibeau ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.  Dramatic video taken by a Globe and Mail reporter showed police warily searching for the shooter in the historic chamber before a loud rifle shot boomed out and then as many as 50 shots rang out in quick succession as cops returned fire.  Politicians and their staffers scrambled down scaffolding that was in place for renovations, while others hid inside barricaded meeting rooms as cops with high-powered rifles and body armor took up positions on the surrounding streets.  A security guard at the building was wounded in the fusillade but was expected to recover.  Canadian authorities said the intruder was taken down by 58-year-old Parliamentary Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.  Zehaf-Bibeau had an extensive criminal record for drugs, assault, and weapons. His most serious crime resulted in a two-year sentence for a robbery.

Neighbors said the shooter grew up living a privileged life in a quiet neighborhood where he attended a private high school.  He told a friend at a British Columbia mosque about three years ago that he was thinking of traveling to the Middle East said “the devil” was after him, the Globe and Mail reported.  The bloodshed came as Canada prepared to join the US-led bombing campaign against ISIS terrorists in Iraq.  The cutthroat jihadis have urged supporters to kill military personnel and civilians in Canada and other countries — even instructing them to use their cars as weapons, as was the case in the Quebec attack.  A witness to Wednesday’s attack said the gunman was dressed in a manner similar to the uniforms worn by ISIS fighters.  “I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth, holding a rifle,” Tony Zobl told the Canadian Press. “The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”  Cirillo didn’t stand a chance. Soldiers who guard the memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and he his comrade were carrying unloaded rifles.  The bespectacled Vickers was hailed as a hero for stopping the attacker’s advance just feet away from the country’s top officials.  Vickers’s brother John told the CBC his sibling called their mom, Monica, in New Brunswick to tell her he was safe.  “I just couldn’t be prouder of him right now,” John said, adding that his brother, a 28-year veteran of the Mounties, has “always been committed to service, people and country” during his law-enforcement career."
E704,0,Confederate Frenzy: NY Film Critic Calls for Banning of ‘Gone With the Wind’,"Book burning.  Movie banning.  Hitler.  Stalin.  Potato.  Potatoe.  When it comes to the Left, it is always only a matter of time before they show their fascist colors. We’re seeing it all over the place in a media frenzy that began with a cause I agree with (removing Confederate Flags from state capitols) into what is now a full-blown mob waging a bullying witch hunt to completely memory-hole the flag.  Wednesday, the thing that you believe could never happen, did happen: a New York film critic has called for the banning of The Greatest Movie Ever Made.  In just three days, the left’s mob mentality took us from removing the Rebel Flag from a state capitol to banning “Gone with the Wind.”  Lou Lumenick in today’s New York Post:  If the Confederate flag is finally going to be consigned to museums as an ugly symbol of racism, what about the beloved film offering the most iconic glimpse of that flag in American culture? I’m talking, of course, about “Gone with the Wind[.]’’ … But what does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the same things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the “GWTW’’ intermission? Warner Bros. just stopped licensing another of pop culture’s most visible uses of the Confederate flag — toy replicas of the General Lee, an orange Dodge Charger from “The Dukes of Hazzard’’ — as retailers like Amazon and Walmart have finally backed away from selling merchandise with that racist symbol. That studio sent “Gone with the Wind’’ back into theaters for its 75th anniversary in partnership with its sister company Turner Classic Movies in 2014, but I have a feeling the movie’s days as a cash cow are numbered. It’s showing on July 4 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the museum’s salute to the 100th anniversary of Technicolor — and maybe that’s where this much-loved but undeniably racist artifact really belongs.  Lumenick isn’t beating around the bush. He’s serious about calling on Warner Bros. to smother the movie outside of museum screening — a self-imposed ban, but a ban nonetheless.  This is akin to book burning. Granted, Lumenick’s not suggesting government agents kick in your door, search your house, and burn your copy “Gone With the Wind” (maybe in another 3 days). Nevertheless, he is talking about removing from the marketplace one of the most treasured pieces of cinematic art the world has ever seen.  Lumenick is also assuming the classic bigoted role of the fascist white liberal patronizing black America.  Did Lumenick ask black America’s opinion before calling for “Gone With the Wind” to be banned?  Apparently not, because in a recent poll, a whopping 73% of black Americans rated “Gone With the Wind” as “one of the best” or a “good/very good” movie.  That doesn’t matter, though. After all, Gaia created white leftists to tell those “ignorant black folk” what’s best for them.  And let’s not forget that Hattie McDaniel won a well-deserved and historic Oscar for “Gone With the Wind,” the first black actor to do so. Are we going to memory-hole her magnificent achievement?  Art is not a flag to be moved.  Art is not a symbol to be nudged.  Art is art is art is art.  Just a few years ago, to make this point as clear as possible, I did an extensive series on The Top 25 Left-Wing Films of All Time. The hate, lies, and bigotry (Christians, Southerners, America) on display in many of these films is deeply offensive to me. Still, these are legitimate works of art. Time capsules. A point of view. A place to start a debate. All 25 of those titles are in my own film collection — and are therefore cherished.  The thought of burning or banishing these films repulses me much more than any of the ideas or prejudices they represent. And that obviously goes for “Gone With the Wind,” as well.  P.S. Just last year the Left attacked me as paranoid over these two pieces:  ‘BLAZING SADDLES’ REVIEW: BUY A COPY BEFORE THE LEFT BURNS THEM ALL  10 REASONS TO BELIEVE THE LEFT WILL EVENTUALLY BAN ‘BLAZING SADDLES’  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC"
politifact12721,0,Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s Emails,"Factsheets  Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s Emails  We’ve put all of the information about Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails here. Just the facts, all in one place.  Why did Clinton use her own email account?  When Clinton got to the Department, she opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience. It enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule.  That is the only reason she used her own account.  Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.  As Clinton has said, in hindsight, it would have been better to just have two accounts. While she thought using one account would be easier, obviously, that has not been the case.  Was it allowed?  Yes. The laws, regulations, and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.  The 2009 National Archives regulation in place during her tenure required that ""[a]gencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."" The regulation recognizes the use of non-government email accounts.  As she has stated, Clinton's practice was to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved. In fact, more than 90% of those emails should have already been captured in the State Department’s email system before she provided them with paper copies.  A Politifact analysis also confirmed that Clinton's practices complied with laws and regulations, including support from the former director of a prominent government accountability organization: ""In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.""  Clinton said she did not use her email to send or receive classified information, but the State Department and two Inspectors General said some of these emails do contain classified information. Was her statement inaccurate?  Clinton only used her account for unclassified email. No information in Clinton's emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them.  When information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.  After reviewing a sampling of the 55,000 pages of emails, the Inspectors General have proffered that a small number of emails, which did not contain any classified markings and/or dissemination controls, should have been classified at the time they were sent. The State Department has said it disagrees with this assessment.  Clinton hopes the State Department and the agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which of the 55,000 pages of emails are appropriate to share with the public.  How did Clinton receive and consume classified information?  The Secretary's office was located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by Clinton while in the office. While on travel, the State Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.  A separate, closed email system was used by the State Department for the purpose of handling classified communications, which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system.  Is Department of Justice conducting a criminal inquiry into Clinton’s email use?  No. As the Department of Justice and Inspectors General made clear, the IGs made a security referral. This was not criminal in nature as misreported by some in the press. The Department of Justice is now seeking assurances about the storage of materials related to Clinton’s email account.  Is it true that her email server and a thumb drive were recently turned over to the government? Why?  Again, when information is reviewed for public release, it is common for information previously unclassified to be upgraded to classified if the State Department or another agency believes its public release could cause potential harm to national security, law enforcement or diplomatic relations.  Clinton hopes that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to share with the public, and that the release will be as timely and as transparent as possible.  When the Department upgraded some of the previously unclassified email to classified, her team worked with the State Department to ensure copies of her emails were stored in a safe and secure manner. She also directed her team to give her server that hosted her email account while she was Secretary to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails that already had been provided to the State Department. Clinton has pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry.  Would this issue not have arisen if she used a state.gov email address?  Even if Clinton's emails had been on a government email address and government device, these questions would be raised prior to public release.  While the State Department's review of her 55,000 emails brought the issue to the Inspectors Generals' attentions, the emails that recently were upgraded to classified prior to public release were on the unclassified .gov email system. They were not on the separate, closed system used by State Department for handling classified communications.  Have Clinton's State Department aides also been asked to provide the Department and Congress with emails from their personal accounts?  We understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.  Clinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now, as they have committed - as she has - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.  Press reports say she used multiple devices – a Blackberry and an iPad – is that true?  Clinton relied on her Blackberry for emailing. This was easiest for her. When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled. She also had access to her email account on her iPad and sometimes used it for that too.  Was she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-"".gov"" email account?  The State Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records. To address these requirements, it was her practice to email government employees on their "".gov"" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.  What did Clinton provide to the State Department?  On December 5, 2014, 30,490 copies of work or potentially work-related emails sent and received by Clinton from March 18, 2009, to February 1, 2013, were provided to the State Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. More than 90% of her work or potentially work-related emails provided to the Department were already in the State Department's record-keeping system because those e-mails were sent to or received by ""state.gov"" accounts.  Early in her term, Clinton continued using an att.blackberry.net account that she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the State Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.  Why did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?  In fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her initial weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.  At the time the printed copies were provided to the Department in 2014, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.  Why didn't Clinton provide her emails to the State Department until December 2014?  In 2014, after recognizing potential gaps in its overall recordkeeping system, the State Department asked for the help of the four previous former Secretaries in meeting the State Department's obligations under the Federal Records Act.  Clinton responded to this request by providing the State Department with over 55,000 pages of emails. As it was Clinton's practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts, the overwhelming majority of these emails should have already been preserved in the State Department’s email system.  In providing these emails to the Department, Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related—including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting—erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the Department and National Archives' determination that over 1250 emails were ""personal"" records (which they have indicated will be returned to her).  After providing her work and potentially work-related emails, she chose not to keep her personal, non-work related emails, which by definition, are not federal records and were not requested by the Department or anyone else.  Why did the State Department ask for assistance in collecting records? Why did the State Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?  The State Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014, to help in further meeting the Department’s requirements under the Federal Records Act.  The letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.  While this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.  Why did Clinton decide not to keep her personal emails?  As Clinton has said before, these were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.  Did Clinton delete any emails while facing a subpoena?  No. As noted, the emails that Clinton chose not to keep were personal emails—they were not federal records or even work-related—and therefore were not subject to any preservation obligation under the Federal Records Act or any request. Nor would they have been subject to the subpoena—which did not exist at the time—that was issued by the Benghazi Select Committee some three months later.  Rep. Gowdy's subpoena issued in March 2015 did not seek, and had nothing to do with, her personal, non-work emails nor her server nor the request by State Department last year for her help in their own record-keeping. Indeed in his March 19th letter, Rep. Gowdy expressly stated he was not seeking any emails that were ""purely personal in nature.""  In March 2015, when Rep. Gowdy issued a subpoena to Clinton, the State Department had received all of Clinton's work-related emails in response to their 2014 request, and indeed, had already provided Clinton's relevant emails to Rep. Gowdy’s committee.  Rep. Gowdy, other Republicans, and some members of the media have seized on a CNN interview with Clinton to question her on this point. Rep. Gowdy has even gone so far as to say Clinton is lying. But he and the others are clearly mistaken.  As Vox reported, ""[S]he didn't lie about the subpoena. … Clinton clearly wasn't responding to the question of whether she'd ever been subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee but whether she'd been subpoenaed before she wiped the emails from her server."" Additionally, Factcheck.org said in its analysis, ""Clinton's denial came in response to a question about deleting emails 'while facing a subpoena,' and Clinton objected to Keilar's 'assumption.' Clinton’s campaign said that the emails were deleted before she received the subpoena and that was the point Clinton was making."" Politifact added, ""Suggesting that Clinton deleted emails while facing a subpoena contradicts what we know about the controversy so far.""  Vox went on to further decry Rep. Gowdy's reaction, saying, ""[T]his one's a particularly absurd gimmick, even for a committee that is selectively leaking from depositions and documents to justify its existence. If there was a more extreme category of dissembling than 'pants on fire,' now would be the time for Politifact to roll it out on the House Republicans.""  Why was the State Department given printed copies?  That is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual (the Department's policy manual) require that ""until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of email messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records."" [5 FAM 443.3].  Were any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?  No.  How many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the State Department?  Her email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.  How and who decided what should be provided to the State Department?  The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].  Following conversations with State Department officials and in response to the State Department's 2014 letter to former Secretaries, Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to review each email and provide printed copies of Clinton's emails to the State Department, erring on the side of including anything that might be even potentially work-related.  A search was conducted on Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.  After this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a "".gov"" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the State Department.  To help identify any potential non-"".gov"" correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.  Next, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.  Lastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: ""Benghazi"" and ""Libya.""  These additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the State Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real-time.  With respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the State Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the State Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  Given Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the State Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Clinton in August 2014 – prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.  The review process described above confirmed Clinton's practice of emailing State Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Clinton provided to the State Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the State Department's record-keeping system in real time.  Did Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?  During her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.  Did she withhold any work emails? What about the 15 emails that Sid Blumenthal provided to the Select Committee that she did not provide to the State Department?  She provided the State Department with all work and potentially work-related emails that she had, including all of her correspondence with Sid Blumenthal. We understand that Mr. Blumenthal had some emails that Clinton did not have, and Clinton had some emails that Mr. Blumenthal did not have, but it is important to note that none of those emails provide any new insights on the attack on our facilities in Benghazi.  Do you think a third party should have been allowed to review what was turned over to the State Department, as well as the remainder that was not?  The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].  Clinton responded to the State Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work and potentially work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure.  After her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral service, family vacations, etc.  Government officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.  Can't she release the emails she provided to the State Department herself?  Because the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the State Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She called for them to be made available as soon as possible, and is glad to see the Department has begun releasing them.  Some of the emails released show Clinton emailed aides at times on their personal, rather than .gov accounts. Was she trying to hide these communications?  As Clinton has said before, it was her practice to email U.S. government officials on their .gov accounts if it was work-related. This is evidenced in the emails released so far. In reviewing her emails in 2014, there was a fraction of emails with work-related information sent to U.S. government officials’ personal accounts, and those were provided to the State Department. The overwhelming majority of her work-related emails were to .gov accounts.  Where was the server for her email located?  The server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.  What level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider?  The security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity about the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. Suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.  Was the server ever hacked?  No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.  Was there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?  No.  What was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as ""Guccifer"" hacked Sid Blumenthal’s account?  While this was not a breach of Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications, including changing her email address.  Was the State Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?  Yes. As the Select Committee has said, the State Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the State Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the State Department received the printed copies.  For example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Clinton on September 12, 2012, was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the State Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.  This example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-"".gov"" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of State Department officials, it was Clinton’s practice to forward it to officials at their ""state.gov"" address; and 2) the State Department was able to search and produce Clinton’s emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts."
politifact351,0,Obama knows his way around a ballot -- chicagotribune.com,"MAKING OF A CANDIDATE  Obama knows his way around a ballot  Some say his ability to play political hardball goes back to his first campaign  1  2  3  4  next  The day after New Year's 1996, operatives for Barack Obama filed into a barren hearing room of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners.    There they began the tedious process of challenging hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions of state Sen. Alice Palmer, the longtime progressive activist from the city's South Side. And they kept challenging petitions until every one of Obama's four Democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot.    Fresh from his work as a civil rights lawyer and head of a voter registration project that expanded access to the ballot box, Obama launched his first campaign for the Illinois Senate saying he wanted to empower disenfranchised citizens.      But in that initial bid for political office, Obama quickly mastered the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics. His overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office, even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like Palmer.    A close examination of Obama's first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career: The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it.    One of the candidates he eliminated, long-shot contender Gha-is Askia, now says that Obama's petition challenges belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusader for voter rights.    ""Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates?"" Askia said. ""He talks about honor and democracy, but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot-free? Why not let the people decide?""    In a recent interview, Obama granted that ""there's a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldn't create barriers to people getting on the ballot.""    But the unsparing legal tactics were justified, he said, by obvious flaws in his opponents' signature sheets. ""To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,"" Obama recalled.    ""I gave some thought to … should people be on the ballot even if they didn't meet the requirements,"" he said. ""My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be.""    Asked whether the district's primary voters were well-served by having only one candidate, Obama smiled and said: ""I think they ended up with a very good state senator.""      Obama behind challenges  1  2  3  4  next  America has been defined in part by civil rights and good government battles fought out in Chicago's 13th District, which in 1996 spanned Hyde Park mansions, South Shore bungalows and poverty-bitten precincts of Englewood.It was in this part of the city that an eager reform Democrat by the name of Abner Mikva first entered elected office in the 1950s. And here a young, brash minister named Jesse Jackson ran Operation Breadbasket, leading marchers who sought to pressure grocery chains to hire minorities.Palmer served the district in the Illinois Senate for much of the 1990s. Decades earlier, she was working as a community organizer in the area when Obama was growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. She risked her safe seat to run for Congress and touted Obama as a suitable successor, according to news accounts and interviews.But when Palmer got clobbered in that November 1995 special congressional race, her supporters asked Obama to fold his campaign so she could easily retain her state Senate seat.Obama not only refused to step aside, he filed challenges that nullified Palmer's hastily gathered nominating petitions, forcing her to withdraw.""I liked Alice Palmer a lot. I thought she was a good public servant,"" Obama said. ""It was very awkward. That part of it I wish had played out entirely differently.""His choice divided veteran Chicago political activists.""There was friction about the decision he made,"" said City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel Black, who tried to negotiate with Obama on Palmer's behalf. ""There were deep disagreements.""Had Palmer survived the petition challenge, Obama would have faced the daunting task of taking on an incumbent senator. Palmer's elimination marked the first of several fortuitous political moments in Obama's electoral success: He won the 2004 primary and general elections for U.S. Senate after tough challengers imploded when their messy divorce files were unsealed.

E547,0,Wrestling star 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper dies at 61,"LOS ANGELES — ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, a pillar of professional wrestling in its 1980s heyday who always wore a kilt into the ring to trumpet his Scottish heritage, has died, TMZ reported Friday. He was 61.  Piper, a Canadian whose real name is Roderick George Toombs, was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in 2006 but was declared cancer-free late last year. TMZ said he died of cardiac arrest sometime Thursday night.  Mashable's messages and emails left with listed representatives for Piper were not immediately returned Friday.  Intense, brash and loud but affable, quick-witted and always willing to indulge fans with handshakes and autographs, Piper was a mainstay of the WWF (which would eventually become the WWE) at the height of its popularity, and was always a fan favorite despite his usual “villain” mantle. Though he was from Canada he was billed as coming from Glasgow, Scotland, and during matches would often fly into a ""Scottish rage.""  Also known as ""Hot Rod,"" Piper started out as a boxer and amateur competitive wrestler before making his pro wrestling debut in Winnipeg at age 15. He developed his ""Rowdy"" villain persona around the local Los Angeles wrestling scene in the late 1970s, and learned early on the value of the wrestling ""feud"" — the likes of which he would have with Hulk Hogan, still considered the greatest single wrestling beef of all time.  Roddy Piper as Nada in the 1988 film ""They Live."" Image: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images  Piper, who appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, had the lead role in the 1988 film They Live, John Carpenter’s cult classic about a nameless drifter who discovers a ruling class of aliens who can only be seen through special sunglasses.  But Piper will always be best remembered for his time in the ring – he was a headlining wrestler for several pay-per-view and big television events, took part in the first WrestleMania in 1985 and despite never winning an outright title was named the sport’s No. 1 villain by the WWE.

pheme_86,0,Charlie Hebdo shooting: At least 12 killed as shots fired at satirical magazine's Paris office,"Witnesses said that at least two gunmen were involved, and that they were seen armed with AK-47s and pump-action shotguns. The attackers themselves are still on the run.  Four of France’s best-known satirical cartoonists, including the magazine's editor, were among the dead. A further 12 people were injured, some gravely, in what is the worst terrorist incident in France for 40 years.  Police said that at least 10 of the killings took place in the initial attack inside the building, or died within minutes because of the seriousness of their injuries.  As the gunmen left in a black Citroën hatchback, they met with a police car which was part of the permanent protection given to the magazine after it was firebombed in 2011. The attackers got out of their vehicle and opened fire, killing two officers.  Video footage posted to social media showed armed gunmen running through the streets of Paris, shooting with automatic weapons and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". According to an eye-witness, one of the gunmen shouted: ""The Prophet is avenged.""  Below is an edited version of one of the videos.  Warning: Viewers may find the following video distressing  Paris has raised its terror alert to the highest setting in the aftermath of the attack, while a manhunt has begun for those involved. A social media post from France's AFP news agency reported that the men may also have been armed with at least one rocket-launcher, though this was not corroborated by other reports.  France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said police were looking for ""three criminals"", though it was not clear how many took part in the shooting itself. All resources had been mobilised, he said, ""to neutralise those who committed this barbaric act"".  A Charlie Hebdo cartoonist who survived the attack described how two ""hooded and armed men"" forced her to enter the code letting them into the magazine's offices.  Armed gunmen face police officers near the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris A victim is evacuated on a stretcher after armed gunmen stormed the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris Corinne ""Coco"" Rey told the French newspaper L'Humanite that the attack lasted five minutes. She said the assailants ""spoke perfect French"" and ""claimed to be from al-Qaeda"".  The French President Francois Hollande has travelled to the scene in Paris's 11th arrondissement after what he called a ""terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity"".  He said it was the latest in a series of terrorist incidents on French soil, and that the nation was in a state of shock.  French President Francois Hollande (C) arrives after a shooting at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo Firefighters and police officers gather in front of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris ""This is a difficult moment for France,"" Hollande told reporters. ""We have prevented several attacks. We knew that we were still under threat because we are a country that cherishes freedom.""  The urgent priority for officials on Wednesday afternoon remained tracking down those responsible. Paris police said the gunmen abandoned their car at the northern Porte de Patin and escaped.  Mr Cazeneuve said the attack had set in motion protective measures across ""all French territories"", including bolstered security at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation hubs.  Police officers secure a vehicle allegedly used by two gunmen in an attack on the 'Charlie Hebdo' headquarters in Paris Police block the roads next to the 'Charly Hebdo' headquarter where a shoutout occurred in Paris Schools across the French capital closed their doors, while top government officials held a meeting of the national emergency committee. President Hollande has scheduled a national TV address to update the public on the situation later on Wednesday evening.  Police confirmed to French media that the dead included the magazine’s editor and chief cartoonist, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as ""Charb"", and Jean Cabut, or ""Cabu"", a veteran of several French newspapers and reportedly the highest paid cartoonist in the world.  According to a journalist at the scene, at least one of the police officers killed had been assigned to protect Mr Charbonnier personally. In 2013 he was included on a ""most wanted"" list published by Inspire, al-Qaeda's terrorist propaganda magazine.  Charb, editor of Charlie Hebdo (Reuters) Jean Cabut, or 'Cabu' Two other cartoonists, Georges Wolinski and Bernard Verlhac, or ""Tignous"", were also reported as having been killed.  Charb had previously defended a controversial series of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2012, saying: ""Muhammad isn't sacred to me. I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings. I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law.""  Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief Gerard Biard escaped the carnage because he was in London.  Cartoonist Georges Wolinski Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac He told France Inter: ""I don't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.""  Mr Biard said he did not believe the attack was linked to the magazine's latest front page, which featured novelist Michel Houellebecq. The writer's new novel ""Submission"", released in France on Wednesday, has caused controversy after it was described by critics as an ""Islamophobic scare story"".  Yet the magazine had not received any recent threats of violence, Mr Biard said: ""Not to my knowledge, and I don't think anyone had received them as individuals, because they would have talked about it. There was no particular tension at the moment.""  A bullet's impact on the window of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, after armed gunmen stormed the offices leaving at least 10 people dead Firefighters carry an injured man on a stretcher in front of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris A year earlier, the magazine's offices were firebombed after a spoof issue featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover. The edition ""invited"" Mohammed to be its guest editor.  According to one report, journalists were discussing a new Islam-themed edition on Wednesday when the gunmen burst in.  The latest post made by the Charlie Hebdo Twitter account was a picture of the Isis militant group leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper which sparked protests when it published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005, has increased its own security in the wake of the Paris shooting, France 24 reported. Charlie Hebdo re-published the same cartoons in 2006.  Firefighters carry an injured man on a stretcher in front of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris Police forces gather in street outside the offices in Paris One witness to Wednesday's shooting, Gilles Boulanger, who works in the same building as the Charlie Hebdo offices, likened the scene to a war zone.  He told the BBC: ""A neighbour called to warn me that there were armed men in the building and that we had to shut all the doors.  ""And several minutes later there were several shots heard in the building from automatic weapons firing in all directions.  ""So then we looked out of the window and saw the shooting was on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, with the police. It was really upsetting. You'd think it was a war zone.""  French soldiers patrol in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris as the capital was placed under the highest alert status A police car riddled with bullets during an attack on the offices of the newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris Another witness, Benoit Bringer, told TV station France Info: ""We heard shouting in the street. We saw hooded men carrying Kalashnikovs enter the building. We called the police. After a few minutes we heard heavy firing, a lot of firing. We went upstairs onto the roof.  ""After about 10 minutes we saw two armed men come out into the street. Three policemen arrived on bikes but had to leave because the men were armed. There was a lot more shouting in the street, a lot more gunshots. The attackers took off in a car.""  David Cameron led the British response to the unfolding incident, condemning the attack on Twitter.  ""The murders in Paris are sickening,"" he posted. ""We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.""  Philip Hammond, the British Foreign Secretary, wrote: ""Appalled to hear news of apparent terrorist attack in Paris. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those killed.""  Flowers, candles and a sign reading 'I am Charlie' are placed against a wall during a demonstration in Paris  Journalism students hold a banner reading in French: 'Journalism students : Solidarity' as they raise pens during a gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris  A statement from the White House also condemned the attack ""in the strongest possible terms"". ""The US stands ready to work closely with the French,"" it said.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel called it an ""attack on freedom of speech"".  ""This abominable act is not only an attack on the lives of French citizens and their security,"" a statement read. ""It is also an attack on freedom of speech and the press, core elements of our free democratic culture. In no way can this be justified.""  Pope Francis has also condemned the shooting. The Vatican said it was ""a double act of violence, abominable because it is both an attack against people as well as against freedom of the press"".  In a statement, the French journalists' union Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) said the attack represented attempts to ""silence"" the entire profession.  ""The massacre perpetrated against the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo is a horror that strikes at us all. When journalists are killed, it is done to make an entire profession feel fear; it is done to silence. Attacking a newspaper is an attempt to muzzle the freedom of expression that exists in a democracy.""  A Twitter campaign under the banner #JeSuisCharlie has quickly gained momentum as thousands pledge support for the magazine and to the victims of the attack."

Steven was discovered dead on June 29, reports RadarOnline, who confirmed his death with the Fulton Country Medical Examiner’s office. The exact cause of death has not been determined, but sources close to Steven told Radar that his “family and friends suspect it was from a drug overdose.”  In Mar 2015, Steven reportedly told Radar that he allegedly helped Bobbi Kristina and Nick get drugs, “sometimes but not regularly” in the past. Steven’s drug dealing had got him arrested twice over the past two years. He was caught in Oct 2013 with 5.8 grams of heroin while he was already had been on probation. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a year in jail. Steven spoke with Radar in March to clear his name, to say that he had cleaned up his act and that he had “a great job and a child on the way.”  Steven had “been on the path to sobriety,” the source also commented, telling Radar that he had been attending AA meetings, but they “believe that he fell back into using heroin or with mixing it.” The exact results of his heartbreaking death won’t be known for another two weeks, as his toxicology test is being conducted in a private lab.  Bobbi Kristina remains in hospice care, after spending five months in an unresponsive state after being found unconscious in her bathtub on Jan 31. Prior to her accident, Bobbi Kristina was allegedly addicted to multiple drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Her ex-boyfriend, Zach Jafarzedeh, reportedly feared that she had taken a Xanax and fell asleep while in the bath, leading to her tragic state.  After Nick recorded his notorious interview with Dr. Phil, he reportedly checked himself into rehab, over him being “severely depressed and abusing drugs.” The interview turned into an intervention, as Nick was visibly in a bad state of mind.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Steven’s family and friends during their time of loss.  — Jason Brow"

pheme_197,0,Sydney Hostage Situation: 3 People Flee Lindt Chocolate Shop,"Police have not said how many people being held in cafe.   -- Three people were seen fleeing from a Sydney cafe after they had been taken hostage -- with others still held inside as neighboring blocks remain locked down as police tried to make contact with the armed perpetrator, authorities said.  The hostages were being held in the Lindt Chocolat Café, a chocolate shop and cafe in Sydney's Martin Place, the city's financial district where the Reserve Bank of Australia and several commercial banks have their main offices. The area is also close to the New South Wales state parliament.  New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn confirmed that three people had gotten away.  ""The first thing we will do is make sure they are OK and then we will work with these people to find out some more information,” Burn said. “Our No. 1 aim is to resolve this incident peacefully.""  Police negotiators are in contact with the armed hostage-taker, but the motive remains unclear, Burn said.  Earlier in the day, video emerged showing people being held inside the shop with their hands held in the air. Two women were also seen inside the cafe holding up what appeared to be a black flag with white Arabic writing on it.  New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said there is at least one armed person holding an undisclosed number of hostages in the cafe. Police have not yet had contact with the hostage taker, he said, adding that the situation began Monday at 9:45 a.m. local time.  In a statement on Facebook, Lindt said, ""We would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and kind support over the current situation at the Lindt Chocolate Café at Martin Place. We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families. The matter is being dealt with by the authorities and we are waiting for any updates from them.""  They are also looking at the flag the hostages have been pictured holding. Scipione also said police have not yet confirmed it is a terrorism event, but they are acting in a manner consistent with a terror attack.  ""We don't yet know the motivation of the perpetrator,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at a news conference earlier in the day.  ""We don't know that this is politically motivated although there is some indications that it could be. We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, there are people who would wish to do us harm.""  Several nearby offices were evacuated as a precaution, police said. People in buildings in the neighboring streets were directed to remain indoors and stay away from open windows.  ""There's a real sense of alertness, awareness, and a bit of shock to be honest,"" said Lisa Martin, who works in an office nearby the cafe and was in lockdown.  ""To know that there are so many people just having coffee and a chocolate are now in a hostage situation is really sobering.""  Earlier, video that aired on Channel 9 Australia showed police with weapons drawn, their attention focused on the cafe. Police said emergency services had responded and streets around the area had been closed.  ""New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking incident in Martin Place in Sydney,"" Abbott said.  He said the National Security Committee of Cabinet has convened for briefings on the situation.  ""This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,"" he said.

E513,0,Fake customer service rep trolls complainers of Target's new gender neutral policy,"Target started an effort to become more gender inclusive, doing so by getting rid of gender-based signs in its store's toy sections. Unfortunately, not everyone is happy about it.  As with every progressive brand change, people have been flooding Target's social media pages with serious and sarcastic complaints about its new policy, which was announced on Aug. 7.  See also: Target rejects gender labels for toy sections after consumer outcry  In response, a Facebook troll called Ask ForHelp has been responding to these unhappy customers with hilariously snarky comments, pretending to represent Target customer service. Naturally, the account doesn't take being made fun of with a grain of salt.  Facebook user Mike Melgaard claims to own the Ask ForHelp account and has been posting screenshots of his favorite interactions online.  Target's new policy only applies to the store's toy sections, meaning signs that distinguish otherwise unisex items, like bicycles and building sets as ""for boys"" or ""for girls,"" will no longer be present in its stores.  However, some people online have confused the new policy to mean that all signage, like men's and women's clothing or other necessary items, will be mixed together as well.  Melgaard has shared screenshots of his interactions with these people in a dedicated photo album on his personal Facebook page, since Ask ForHelp has been removed from the site."

Beach went on to say that the cough you can get from an indoor pool is also caused by the chemical reaction. The chlorine isn't what causes the irritation in your lungs; it's pee.    There's actually been an increase in disease outbreaks from public swimming pools, according to Beach, thanks in large part to those swimming while they have diarrhea. Those with diarrhea don't even have to defecate in the pool to spread disease, but just have the germs on their body, which is why the CDC encourages swimmers to shower before getting in the pool.    ""We have a new parasitic germ that has emerged that's immune to chlorine,"" says Beach. ""We've got to keep it out of the pool in the first place. We need additional barriers.""  The misconception that chlorine just eliminates all germs upon contact is untrue, and it takes time to properly disinfect for each germ. While chlorine kills most bacteria such as E. Coli in less than a minute, it takes at least 16 minutes to kill Hepatitis A, and the Cryptosporidium parasite can last in the swimming pool for over 10 days.    The CDC says the only way to prevent recreational water illnesses is to keep germs out of the pool in the first place and to practice the following steps for healthy swimming:  %shareLinks-quote=""Stay out of the water if you have diarrhea.Shower before you get in the water.Do not pee or poop in the water.Do not swallow the water.Take kids on bathroom breaks.Check diapers, and change them in a bathroom or diaper-changing area -- not poolside -- to keep germs away from the pool.Reapply sunscreen.Drink plenty of fluids."" type=""spreadWord""%    More from AOL.com:  Modesto woman stops to use restroom, becomes millionaire  Survey says people who wear skinny jeans are happier  37 gorgeous pools everyone should swim in once"
politifact181,0,Teamsters Tout ANWR on Capitol Hill,"A vote for exploration of Alaska's National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) is a vote for environmental responsibility, Jerry Hood, a Teamsters leader from Alaska, said during a Capitol Hill news conference Tuesday, July 31, 2001.  ""We know it can be done safely,"" said Hood, who is Special Advisor for Energy Policy to Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa. Hood is also Secretary-Treasurer of Local 959 in Anchorage.  Hood noted that 58 percent of the petroleum used by the United States is imported, and that figure will jump to 70 percent by 2010. Hood said the imported oil arrives in largely unsafe, single-hull oil tankers. Hood recalled the 1989 Exxon Valdez tragedy in Alaska.  ""We never want to see that again,"" Hood said. Exploring for oil in Alaska will make the United States less dependent on imports, he said.  The Teamsters Union supports the creation of 735,000 good-paying jobs for working families that would result from opening ANWR. Hood said he is confident the House of Representatives will vote to approve ANWR oil exploration. The House is scheduled to begin debate Wednesday, August 1, and a vote is expected by Thursday, August 2.  Hood was joined at the news conference by Reps. Tom Delay, (R-Texas), J.C. Watts (R-OK) and Roy Blunt (R-MO). U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao also spoke.  ""We ask members of the House and Senate to act upon the President's energy plan,"" Chao said.

pheme_151,0,"Youngest Suspect in Charlie Hebdo Attack Turns Himself In, 2 Others Sought"," -- The youngest suspect in today's deadly attack at a satirical newspaper's office in Paris has turned himself in, French police said, while the other two are “on the loose, armed and dangerous.""  French authorities have named the three suspects who they believe are responsible for the shooting deaths of 12 people, U.S. law enforcement officials told ABC News.  Officials identified the suspects as Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, two relatives both in their 30s and still at large, and 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, who police say is cooperating after his surrender in the French town of Charleville-Mezieres, about 140 miles north of Paris.  Cherif Kouachi, 34, is listed in a private database, ABC News has confirmed.  Kouachi, along with six others, was sentenced in May 2008 to 3 years in prison for terrorism in Paris. All seven men were accused of sending about a dozen young Frenchmen to join Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, after funneling them through radical religious establishments in Syria and Egypt. French authorities believed Kouachi had been planning to go to Syria for training in 2005.  Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman earlier today told ABC News that two of the assailants went inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo and listed off the names of their targets before shooting them execution style. The third man was waiting outside the building.  The French president called the attack a ""terrorist operation.""  The shooting at the office of Charlie Hebdo was a ""cowardly attack,"" said President Francois Hollande when he was at the scene this morning.  ""This is a terrorist operation against an office that has been threatened several times, which is why it was protected,"" he said, without going into the specifics of the police protection at the office in the center of Paris. Photos from the scene show a police car riddled with bullet holes.  The newspaper had been targeted in the past over its content, often aimed at religious groups.  French officials confirmed that there are believed to be three attackers, all of whom were seen in videos wearing black from head-to-toe. Their identities and affiliations have not been revealed but one of the men is heard screaming ""Allahu Akbar,"" an Islamic phrase meaning ""God is great,"" in one of the scene videos.  This morning's turmoil punctured an otherwise normal day in the French capital, with the gunshots audible from nearby buildings, sending bystanders cowering. The masked gunmen were later seen fleeing the scene and hijacked a car, authorities said. They have not been caught and a search is underway for the shooters.  The tragedy marks France's deadliest terror attack in decades. The government raised its terror alert to the highest level and reinforced security at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation.  The New York City Police Department ordered extra security to the French consulate in Manhattan and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that they are closely monitoring the events in France and are ready to adjust their ""security posture, as appropriate.""  Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, has come under attack before. Their office was firebombed in 2011 and its website was hacked after its cover featured the prophet Muhammad. Nearly a year later, the publication again published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the Muslim world.  The cover of this week's issue of the newspaper focuses on a new book by Michel Houellebecq, “Submission,” which depicts France led by an Islamic party that bans women from the workplace.  President Obama condemned the ""outrageous"" attack.  ""France is America’s oldest ally, and has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorists who threaten our shared security and the world,"" President Obama's statement read. ""Time and again, the French people have stood up for the universal values that generations of our people have defended.""  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed sadness following the shooting.  Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

E772,0,Cherry Creek Schools says lunch lady wasn’t fired for giving away food,"Cherry Creek School District on Wednesday disputed claims of Della Curry, a former kitchen manager who said she was fired for giving hot lunches to students who didn’t have the money to pay for them.  “It is important to share that the Cherry Creek School District has in place a practice that ensures that every student receives a nutritious meal regardless of their ability to pay,” the statement read. “Ms. Curry was not dismissed for giving free food to financially disadvantaged students. Numerous documented incidents resulted in the action taken by the Cherry Creek School District.”  The district said it could not divulge details of a personnel issue without Curry’s permission. Curry told The Denver Post on Wednesday she was not inclined to sign such a waiver.  Curry, 35, who worked at Dakota Valley Elementary School in Aurora, said she willingly violated a district policy by giving away meals to children who didn’t meet federal income guidelines, adding that the policy needs to be changed.  However, Cherry Creek Schools spokeswoman Tustin Amole said Curry made no efforts to approach them to discuss policy changes.  Curry’s situation has become a international story. She has been interviewed on CNN, and her story has appeared in USA Today, People magazine and The Daily Mail, among other publications."
pheme_66,0,"'Canada will never be intimidated,' Harper says after shootings in Ottawa","Two “despicable attacks” on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country’s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.  Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.  The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.  Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.  “This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.  “We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.  “But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”  Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”  National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”  The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.  Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""  But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”  RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.  Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.  Panic on the Hill  The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.  When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.  A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.  Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.  Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.  Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.  Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.  Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.  ""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.  ""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""  Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.  Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.  “This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.  He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.  “If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.  The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.  Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.  “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”  The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.  On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.  Security beefed up  The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.  Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.  U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.  Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.  The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”  “We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.  A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”  With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press  An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

politifact15164,1,Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid,"Vice President Biden on Monday raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.  “I am going to run in 2020,” Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future. “What the hell man, anyway.”  Asked if he was kidding about running, the 74-year-old paused before saying he is “not committing not to run.”  “I am not committed to anything,” he added. “I learned a long time ago, fate has a strange way of intervening.”  It would be surprising if Biden decided to continue his decadeslong political career, which many assumed would end once President Obama and he leave the White House next month.  Biden will be 78 in 2020 and would by far be the oldest person ever to win a major-party presidential nomination if he became the Democrats’ standard-bearer.  After months of toying with a presidential run this cycle, Biden announced last October that he would not mount a bid. He said he ran out of time “necessary to mount a winning campaign” while mourning the loss of his son, Beau, to cancer.  Biden spoke publicly before the election about his post-White House plans, which include working on his cancer moonshot initiative, a possible policy project with a major university and writing a book.  The vice president was at the Capitol on Monday afternoon to preside over the Senate as it held a vote on legislation funding the cancer initiative, a portion of which the chamber named after Beau.  He would have to put that work aside if he decided to launch a presidential bid in four years.  The vice president has long had his eye on the Oval Office. He ran for president in 1988 and again in 2008, losing both times in his party’s primary.  In the past few months, he has repeatedly refused to rule out a future run for office. He told CNN in October his decision not to run in 2016 was solely because of his son’s death.  ""I didn't run for one simple overarching reason. My son was dying and he died,"" Biden said. ""I didn't not run because Hillary’s running. I didn't run because my son's not here.”"
politifact15570,1,Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama Secretly Gave Citizenship to 2500 Iranians as Part of Nuke Deal,"A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.  He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.  From Fox News:  Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.  Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.  While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.  “When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”  He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”  It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.  But it obviously raises a concerning question.  There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.  And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.  The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.  Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.  This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.  And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.”  The protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn’t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.  There’s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.  But it could be interesting if it’s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back."
politifact14776,1,"Pope Francis At Mass: ‘Jesus Is Metaphorical, Not Literal’","Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.  The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.  Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:  PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’  Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”  Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.  Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.  PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’  The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.  “Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.  The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.  OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’  In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”  The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”  Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”  France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.  Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?"

politifact15004,1,"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is ‘Rigged’, Found Dead","An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”  Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.  Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.  Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.  However Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”      Telling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.  “I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.  “Football in America won’t recover from this.”  Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.  According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.  “This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”  “How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.“  “You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”  “The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”  Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”  The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.  In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.  The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.  How are games rigged?  According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.  “Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?  “Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I’m telling you now, they don’t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?”  “The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.”  “How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?”  “Everyone is on the same side, that’s why.”  “These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can’t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.”  Why doesn’t anyone speak out?  According to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.  “Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.  “It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.”  “And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. “We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We’re exempt.”  Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday."
politifact14693,1,"The hacked emails at the center of Mueller’s Russia investigation, explained","Update: On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials who he alleges are involved in these hackings and leaks. You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.  Original post: There’s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn’t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.  The hacking and release of leading political figures’ emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia’s government. And it’s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what “collusion” between Donald Trump’s team and the Russians might have involved.  That’s not mere speculation. We’ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don’t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance — but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller’s team.  These hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn’t just emails stolen, either — posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was “probably worth millions of dollars” to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama’s passport.  No charges have been filed in the matter — yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified “more than six members of the Russian government” involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind “Guccifer 2.0,” a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe.  To understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself.  How the hacks happened (a phishing expedition)  The media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC’s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly.  The full story is more complex. Let’s start at the beginning.  Between March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The “baited lines” they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:  These emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials — delivering them right into the hackers’ hands.  According to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors.  Particularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just “a handful” of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers — along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others — had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)  Russia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time — a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia’s foreign military intelligence agency. We don’t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and — most famously — “Fancy Bear.”  Circumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine — at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine’s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin’s regime.  The Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin’s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday — Moscow time.  Around April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed “Cozy Bear”) had been in the DNC’s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015.  The precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear’s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we’ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia’s GRU — the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear — for taking “large volumes of data from the DNC.”  As striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time.  What came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms — the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts.  A timeline of odd events between the hacks and the leaks  The backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election — the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin’s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.  It was around this point — in mid-March 2016 — that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats’ and Clinton campaign staffers’ email accounts, according to SecureWorks’ analysis.  There were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:  April 7: Putin condemns the Panama Papers leak . In early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth — the Panama Papers. Many of the documents revealed financial information about Putin’s inner circle, and Putin publicly claimed the stories were part of a US plot against Russia. “They are trying to destabilize us from within in order to make us more compliant,” he said. Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate.

Philip Breedlove, who had commanded NATO forces in Europe and pushed for a harder line against Russia in Ukraine. They also included documents from George Soros’s Open Society Foundation.

They also included documents from George Soros’s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.) June 9: The Trump Tower meeting: Shortly afterward, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met a Russian lawyer and four other people with Russian ties at Trump Tower. Don Jr. had agreed to take the meeting based on the promise of “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,” as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” (as it was put to him in an email). Everyone involved claims nothing came of this meeting.  Throughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures’ emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change.  The email leaks begin  On June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. “We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,” he announced, during a British television interview. “We have emails pending publication.”  WikiLeaks — a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist — had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department — leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation’s London embassy since June 2012.  Assange’s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked — by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike’s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit.  Yet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder — because that is when “Guccifer 2.0” arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of “Gucci” and “Lucifer,” is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who’d broken into high-profile Americans’ email accounts.)  In a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, “a lone hacker.” (“Fuck CrowdStrike!!!” he wrote.) He said that he’d given “the main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails” that he’d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server.  Almost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer’s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian — or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia’s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account’s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN — allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)  Yet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks’ DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta’s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun’s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)  On July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker’s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange’s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill’s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was “gradually forget[ing] about me,” and complained that WikiLeaks was “playing for time.”)  All the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It’s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but “we were given a little more time.” (It’s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)  Finally, on July 22 — the Friday before the convention — WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:  The DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer’s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC’s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. “Holy fuck man I don’t think you realize what you gave me,” Nevins wrote in a DM. “This is probably worth millions of dollars.” Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog.  Then DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site’s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell’s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (“greedy”) and Trump (“national disgrace”).  DCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama’s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders’s young supporters were “living in their parents’ basement.” Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall’s phished emails came next.  Many of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation.  Assange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had “thousands of pages of material” and was “working around the clock” to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying “an intermediary” who’d met with Assange said “the mother lode is coming Wednesday.”  The “mother lode” instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta’s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news.  In the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words “Hillary Clinton” and “emails” in the headlines throughout the campaign’s final stretch.  Trump associates tried to get in touch with hackers or leakers at least six separate times  During the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin’s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic.  No one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn’t mere idle speculation, either — there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:  1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear’s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed — on April 26 — that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming.  As described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he’d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton — and, specifically, thousands of emails.  We don’t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he’d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)  In any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it.  2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 — a little more than a month after Papadopoulos’s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked — that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who’d done business with the Trumps:  The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.  Don Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov.  Once the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he’d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia.  Goldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was “eerily weird” considering what they’d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that.  3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO’s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late.  And last year, we learned that Cambridge’s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails.  Nix says that in “early June,” after he learned of Assange’s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down.  Then in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he’d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn’t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn’t go anywhere.  4) Donald Trump Jr.’s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group’s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign.  As best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new “PAC run anti-Trump site,” PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. “Any comments?” the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: “Off the record I don’t know who that is but I’ll ask around. Thanks.”  Then on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to “comment on” or “push” a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to “just drone” Assange. Don Jr. answered, “Already did that earlier today. It’s amazing what she can get away with.”  He then followed up with a question: “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?” This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta’s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr.  5) Roger Stone’s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump’s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward.  Both in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks.  One associate of Stone’s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he’d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)  The initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg: “I dined with Julian Assange last night,” according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn’t in London then.)  The day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer’s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn’t responsible. He also tweeted that “Julian Assange is a hero.”  Three days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. “I actually have communicated with Assange,” he said. “I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there’s no telling what the October surprise may be.”  A few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive.  On August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.” Many would later point to this — which came months before the Podesta emails became public — and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone’s old friend Paul Manafort’s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting “Podesta’s business dealings would be exposed.”)  As October began, Stone took on a new role — as WikiLeaks’ hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a “friend” of his met with Assange and learned “the mother lode is coming Wednesday.” He tweeted: “Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.” And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, “Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.” Assange published the Podesta emails two days later.  Immediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group “has never communicated with Roger Stone.” The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were “attacking” him. “The false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,” WikiLeaks responded. “Don’t go there if you don’t want us to correct you.” Stone shot back: “Ha! The more you ‘correct’ me the more people think you’re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.”  What to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks’ plans. However, he’s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven’t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge.  In any case, we might learn more from Mueller’s probe soon enough. “They want me to testify against Roger,” Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel’s team. “They want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.”  6) Peter Smith’s hunt for Hillary’s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign — and it’s a weird one.  This one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be “personal” rather than work-related, and deleted them.  Conservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn’t take Clinton’s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,” Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That will be next.”  It was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton’s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the “dark web.” So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails.  Smith didn’t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader “Trump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).” It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven’t commented.)  Eventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal’s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton’s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. “We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,” Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn’t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith — 81 years old and in poor health — killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris.  Smith’s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn’s role — particularly since, per Harris’s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn’s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller’s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does.  Mueller will likely bring charges in the email hacking matter. But against whom?  Last November, the Wall Street Journal’s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges.  Interestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was “relatively technical” and had already “been under way for nearly a year.”  That appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added “a veteran cyber prosecutor,” Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)  So it’s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he’ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don’t know — for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?  It’s important to remember that this is all just what we know about — there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it’s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence.  Mueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith’s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort’s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?  All three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven’t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it’s safe to say they’re telling Mueller a good deal that’s of interest — and eventually, we will find out what."
politifact15049,1,Melania Trump Hired Exorcist To ‘Cleanse White House Of Obama Demons’,"First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.  “I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.  “They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”  After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left – a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.  “Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.  The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”  “I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”  Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.  In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.  A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.  In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”  Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.  With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building."

politifact14750,1,BREAKING! Roy Moore’s Accuser Worked for Democratic Leaders and Is Actively Campaigning for Moore’s Opponent ⋆ Elizabeth Johnston,"Advertisement  We have just received information that one of the women accusing Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30’s is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.  Deborah Wesson Gibson, aka Debbie Gibson, was named in the Washington Post article accusing Moore, and social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC.  Wesson Gibson is a sign language interpreter, who has interpreted at rallies for both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.  She has also vocalized fervent support for Jones.  Also, of course, she is a vocal opponent of Roy Moore and is clearly dedicated to him losing:  This is not surprising, considering the timing of these wild stories of Moore courting and even sexually groping teenage girls when he was in his 30’s. Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.  Consider how suspicious this is – a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation – and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.  The establishment doesn’t want Roy Moore, a man who can’t be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOS…time to meet a real man!  Kayla Moore, Roy Moore’s wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that “The Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. We’ve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.”  Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!  Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.  Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:  The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced!  We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.  I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!  Our nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.  Our children and grandchildren’s futures are on the line.  So rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!  The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons they’ve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.  This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man they’ve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story can’t hold water for long!  This statesman is going through the fires of testing for the survival of this nation. Let us all pray for him and give him our most generous support right now. Visit RoyMoore.org now!!

Sir Meyer, who is the former UK Ambassador to the United States, was targetted after he publically expressed his support for Donald Trump's visit.  The retired diplomat was left with a bleeding and swollen eye socket, a burst lip and a possible broken nose.  Violent riots have gripped the nation's capital as citizens take to the streets in a shameful display of fascism and intolerance.  Meyer's wife, Baroness Catherine Meyer, has expressed her anger at the brutal attack, saying it ""was politically motivated,"" adding: ""It's just not right.""  ""I'm absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality. They really beat him. It's appalling — like something you would see in a war zone,"" she said.  “He looks terrible,"" she continues.

He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.  As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.  After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.  He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.  The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.  He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.  Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.  Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.  Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.  A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:  ""Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.  ""A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.

The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.  ADVERTISEMENT  Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.  The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.  When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”  In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.  “The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.  The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.  That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.  But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.  Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderBiden: 'Simply wrong' for Trump DOJ to seek journalists' phone records Returning the ghost of Eric Holder to the Justice Department Republicans eye new House majority through redistricting MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.  Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.  Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.  Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.  His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.  In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.  “As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.  “Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.  Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.  The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.  One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.  Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.  But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.  The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.  By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.  The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.  The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.  On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.  Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.  “I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.  Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.  Former Rep.

politifact14810,1,BREAKING: Federal Judge Grants Permission To Subpoena Trump,"Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.  D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.  The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.  “This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.  Per the Post:  Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”  The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.  President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion."

But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.  Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”  Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s Murder  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now  Rich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.  Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”  SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty  Rich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.  Brazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”  Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”  Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”  In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.  Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”  Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication."
politifact15109,1,Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.  Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.  Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.  Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:  Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?  Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”  Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.  “She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”  As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.  “I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.  Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.  The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.  Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:  So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.  Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.  The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was."

The terror group is sharing personal details about the 11-year-old boy on social media channels, including the private address of his school, and Melania Trump is pulling no punches, laying the blame for the rise of ISIS firmly at the feet of Barack Obama.  The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translated the mass calls for the murder of President Trump’s youngest son on the popular “Telegram” app.  “Using the hashtag ‘handle the son of the mule of America,’ the supporter, who uses the name ‘Dak Al-Munafiqeen,’ Arabic for ‘striking the hypocrites,’ wrote: ‘Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington,'” according to MEMRI. “The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.”  The rise of ISIS, funded and supported by Barack Obama, is viewed as another Obama-era failed project in in D.C., and Melania Trump has warned Obama that “if his chickens come home to roost in my house, if anything happens to my son, I will scratch his eyes out.“  “Supporting terrorists anywhere in the world can have serious and long term consequences,” Melania Trump said, “and if any of these psychopaths so much as lay a finger on Barron there will be hell to pay.”  Explaining that death threats from Islamic State terrorists have “already had an impact” on her son, the First Lady said “This is all on the head of Barack Obama.“  “I have always found it hard being polite to that man, considering all of the things he has done, but it will be even harder now.“  The influence Barack Obama had over the world was profound and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking at trouble around the United States and the world, you realize that Obama’s hand is in everything.  But as Melania Trump says, while Obama may be traveling the world as though he is still president, attempting to operate a shadow government to undermine President Trump’s presidency, Obama’s influence is steadily waning, and the terrorists he helped rise in the Middle East are in retreat.  We are on the verge of taking our country back."
politifact15599,1,"THIS IS AMAZING: In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president…They forgot…..","The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…  THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:  ‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.  He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.  While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’  “He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”  Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.  IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.  Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.  He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.  The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.  Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’  The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.  That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.  ‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.  The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.  For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.  Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.  Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.  ‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’  ‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’  Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’  Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.  He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.  ‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.  ‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’  His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.  Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.  Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’  The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?”  ‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’  ‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’  Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.  He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.  He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.  His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.  Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.  His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them.  After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.  Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?  He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.  His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.  The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.  He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.  He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.  AREN’T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!  source:https://100percentfedup.com"
politifact14905,1,"Obama, Not Donald Trump, May Be Invited to Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle","The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.  But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.  Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now  Mark Blinch/Reuters  When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.  If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.  Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.  Read more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'  The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.  As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.  “We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.  Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”  Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire."
politifact14698,1,Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’,"302 SHARES Share Tweet  The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”  “Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.  Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”  After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“  “The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”  The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.  In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”  “We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”"

politifact15130,1,Could Trump Win The Nobel Peace Prize? Peace in Korean Peninsula Would Be Significant Foreign Policy Achievement,"With the unthinkable now cautiously possible, peace between North and South Korea, speculation about President Donald Trump becoming a Nobel Peace Prize winner has begun. If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump’s candidacy.  Recognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace.  But, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump’s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won’t get the credit. “Remember who decides this stuff,” he tweeted. “... The globalist elite would never give him that win.”  Getty Images  It’s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.  Trump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With “rocket man” quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war.  After the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now  “I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,"" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.""  If that meeting and Friday’s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award.  “We’re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,” Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends.  Laura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday.  “When will we see the headline: “Trump Ends the Korean War”? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Ingraham said.  If Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger’s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because “peace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.”  “When the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,” he said.  Other controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time.  Former President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.""  The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa.  There are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organization’s website. The winners will be announced on December 10."

This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.  Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”  Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.  As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life.

politifact15579,1,US Representatives Agree To ‘Illicit’ UN Gun-Control Plans,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Most liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.  Many people ascertain that the United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it certainly sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The UN conference “provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,” according to politifact.  Politifact also claimed, “Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.” Adding,  “‘The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,’ Dorminey wrote in an email. ‘The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.'”  “‘Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.'”  However, the wording here is suspicious.  The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.  It appears that the agreement could also include ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.  According to some, the United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name. Many think they are hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.  The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.  This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.  If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.  However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.  So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.  The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.  Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).  Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.  Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.  Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.  Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.  Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.  In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.  If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.  This agreement seems wildly unconstitutional, but UN officials don’t see it that way.  By requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it seems to violate the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are “reserved to the states respectively.”  The idea of a ‘liaison’ between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.  Perhaps it’s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.  Perhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‘illicit firearms trade.’"
politifact15191,1,Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day,"An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall.  Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, said he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate consuming the country. If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.  Jacob had met with the school’s principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting. But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the “students to express themselves.”  COLLEGE STUDENT KICKED OUT OF CLASS FOR TELLING PROFESSOR THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS  This left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control.  He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.  When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.  Jacob’s father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral – and did nothing wrong.  “Politics [doesn’t] belong in the school,” he said. “Students shouldn’t be pressured into taking a side.”  STUDENT WITH ‘TRUMP’ FLAG ASSAULTED BY MOB DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT  The story went viral after Jacob sent a photo of his out-of-school suspension citation to one of his friends, who posted it on social media.  The school, as well as the Shoemakers, have received death threats and hate messages.  Scott Shoemaker said his son was just trying to be introspective – and he wasn’t acting out.  “He didn’t do anything to deserve this,” he said. “He didn’t ask for this.”  CHICAGO STUDENTS ALLEGEDLY TRASH WALMART DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT PROTEST  The district says it's responsible for students' safety and they can't be unsupervised.

politifact14722,1,Texas Church Shooter Was Antifa Member Who Vowed To Start Civil War,"The gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.  Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.  Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.  Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.  Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”  Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.  His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.  An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”  President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.  Source: YourNewsWire"
politifact14832,1,BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With Falsification,"SHARE this story with your friends!  1.7k SHARES Share Tweet Share  After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.  The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks to her story:  “My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing.” Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.  Moore’s attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for women’s rights."

politifact15190,1,Student Hasn't Stopped Filming Since Florida School Shooting,"David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.  And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor—Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel—knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg—who’s an editor at the school’s TV station—found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.  The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.  “While I was in there, I thought, ‘What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?’” Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. “And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that’s all I could think: Get other people’s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that’s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.”  In the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It’s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it’s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.  “When do we say, that’s not acceptable, something has to change?” asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.  Hogg’s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.  RELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action  Will Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman’s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven’t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn’t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher’s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.  “It was hot in there. We were packed in tight,” he told TIME. “Some students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.” Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.  “My husband is ex-military, so it’s not like we’re anti-gun. But an AR-15?” Kristi Gilroy said. “You tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?” Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she’d taught when they were younger.  The usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. “Now, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,” Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. “Our students are asking for that.”  President Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.  “To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,” Trump said. “We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.”  Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she’d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. “Having to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,” she said, her eyes full of tears.  To some, however, words of comfort won’t be enough. “When do we actually stand up? I think it’s the time that we all stand up,” Hogg demanded. “If you don’t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it’s going to be your child that’s next. And that’s horrifying.”  Meanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it’s okay to go back to school, that they’re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.  Get The Brief.

politifact15031,1,Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.  Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.  Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.  In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.  The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.  A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.  “The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.  Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.  The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.  But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.  The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.  Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing."
politifact14564,1,Head Of NFL Fines Steeler Teammates $1 MILLION Each!,"  BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube  The hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?    Alejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube  Kim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.  As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.  Fire chief apologizes for calling Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin ‘n-word’ on Facebook | TribLIVE  Chief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers’ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. “Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,” Smith wrote in the post.Cecil’s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. “The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,” officials said in a written statement.  See? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.  They can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.

Stadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday’s Super Bowl — to the tune of about $300 million.  All this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyed…"

The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism.”  Another development involving the U.S. Senate race in Alabama. At least one person in our viewing area received a robocall seeking more damaging information about Roy Moore. Here is the text of that voicemail message received by Pastor Al Moore in Creola.  “Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5000 and $7000 dollars. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report.

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.  ‘As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database “target hit” on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a “probable witness” against the Clinton Foundation.,  ‘Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey—and whose inclusion in the SVR’s database of “potential witnesses” against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine” for the New Jersey Department of Education.’  ‘Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)—and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.’  ‘Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history—that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the United States—with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their “EpiPen Law” that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.’  ‘Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens—became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.—with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin’s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.’  ‘To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the United States opioid crisis—that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of America with opioids—and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin’s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.’  ‘This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee—and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee—that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State—and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:  “Purdue’s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.  Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative – that long-term use of opioids didn’t create addicts but instead caused “pseudo addictive” symptoms.  The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee’s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.  Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher “quality of life.”  The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin – Purdue’s financial rainmaker – was better for patients than other opioids on the market.”  <img src=""https://media.8ch.net/file_store/b4a605f160e4e0f03903a232c185067ff24b83dd8a1f8b361f2be3dfc83dbdb3.jpeg"" style=""max-height:640px;max-width:360px;"">  <span style=""margin-top:15px;rgba(42,51,6,0.7);font-size:12px;"">Credit:<a href=""http://www.theeventchronicle.com/cabal-exposed/new-jersey-couple-set-to-testify-to-grand-jury-against-the-clintons-die-in-new-jersey-home-explosion-2/""> The Event Chronicle </a></span  American nurse Carole Paladino (above) identified by SVR as being “probable witness” against Clinton  Foundation  Related Coverage: <a href=""http://thegoldwater.com/news/29430""> Clinton Body Count Series: #1.

Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.  Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.  Jones wrote:  “Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”  Judge Perry added:  “Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”  Source: http://dailyworldupdate.com"
politifact15123,1,"Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDA’s ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccines","For Immediate Release: February 26, 2018 Statement From: Scott Gottlieb, M.D.  Commissioner of Food and Drugs - Food and Drug Administration ( May 2017 - April 2019 )      Español  The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.  As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.  As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.  These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.  Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2  There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.  While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.  So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?  We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.  However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.  Working to determine the root causes  Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.  What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.  The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.  Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season  While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.  In the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. It’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.  The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.  The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.  ###"
politifact14954,1,82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty,"82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.  The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.  Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.  Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:  “Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.  While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.  Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”  Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?  DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”  DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.

For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.  Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.  Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.  Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.  “The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.  The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.  According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.  “It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire  Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.  Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”  He also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.  “Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you.

Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian  What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.  The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

While Puerto Rico’s Governor has praised Donald Trump’s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come into San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.  “We simply don’t have the staff or resources to distribute countrywide,” Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that “anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.”  Unfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.  Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them."

These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”  Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”  “We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

politifact14664,1,ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.  The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.  Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.  Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.  Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.  Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.  The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.  The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”  According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.

politifact15146,1,ICE removal key goal of Democrats in 2020 election,"The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.  In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.  “This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.  In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.  “ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”  Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.  “These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”  But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.  “ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”  Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.  “Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”  He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”  Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”  PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’  The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”  “Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.  Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.  SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’  Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”  “It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound policy?”"
politifact14841,1,UPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations,"The Democrat Party is up to their usual dirty tricks as Republican senate candidate Roy Moore fights against their cheating ways in an effort to become Alabama’s next senator.  According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.  “Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”  Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.  This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.  All but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.  How many other dirty tricks will be exposed?"

politifact14814,1,New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘Have No Value’ And Should All Be Executed,"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.  Advertisement  The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.  Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.  Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.  The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.  Advertisement  After both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.  Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.  “I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”  Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”  In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.  “These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”  “The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.  “It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”  Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000."

As winter weather begins to set in across the United States, federal politicians are reportedly making huge cuts to a crucial government program that provides heating assistance to the elderly and disabled. Under the GOP proposal, millions of American households will be at risk of losing heat this winter, as reported by the Independent.co.uk  Sadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.  As Gray TV reported recently, “President Donald Trump proposed cutting the multi-billion-dollar program as part of his budget plan. Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes.”  This is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s utter disregard for everyday people in our country. Time and time again, Trump has taken every opportunity he has to make life harder for the people in the bottom 50 percent of America.

politifact14745,1,UPDATE: Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW - Departed,"Read original article here  Liberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.    Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.    Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.    One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”    “Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”    What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source."

E634,1,Activists prepare for gay marriage decision,"Washington (CNN) New Mexico Pastor Steve Smothermon says he is ready to go to jail to protect his religious freedom. And he is not the only one.  Smothermon is one of more than 50,000 people who have signed a pledge to engage in social disobedience if the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling this month that would legalize same sex marriage across the country.  ""We want to help people, but we are not going to be forced by the government and society or the politically correct to say we are going to believe in it,"" said Smothermon, senior pastor of Legacy Church in Albuquerque. ""If they said, 'Listen pastor, we are going to put you in jail if you don't honor this.' I am going to say, 'Then put me in jail.' ""  Emotions are running high as the nation waits to see how the Court will rule on whether states should be required to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples and if a state should be forced to recognize same sex marriages performed in another state. Some social conservatives argue that recognizing same sex marriage will weaken the nation's moral fabric as well as their religious freedom. Supporters of a constitutional right for same sex marriage say it is high time the nation recognized these unions.  No matter how the Court rules, it is expected to have dramatic political implications in the 2016 elections and beyond.  Shifting opinion  Until recent years, same sex marriage has been an issue relegated to the shadows, as politicians either did not support or would not publicly endorse it.  And it wasn't just Republicans who opposed same sex marriage. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act -- a law that defined marriage as being between a woman and man. Clinton would later disavow his decision. President Barack Obama waited until 2012, seven months before Election Day, to announce his support of the right for gays and lesbians to marry.  Support of same sex marriage by elected officials tracks with changing public opinion on the issue. A majority of Americans, 63%, believe that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to get married, according to a May CNN/ORC International Poll. In August 2010, the CNN/ORC poll showed that 51% of Americans believed that gays and lesbians did not have a constitutional right to marry.  ""It is amazing thing for someone like me, who has been in politics for 35 years now, to see in your own lifetime an issue going from being a strong negative for your party to being a strong positive the way gay marriage has,"" said Richard Socarides, an openly gay Democrat, who served as a senior adviser to President Clinton. ""Democrats supported gay rights and never wanted to talk about it and Republicans opposed gay rights and always wanted to talk about it. It has completely shifted in a very short period of time.""

Hide Caption 14 of 14  This shift is particularly pronounced with Democrats and Independents. The 2010 CNN/ORC poll shows that 56% of Democrats and 57% of Independents supported a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to be married. In the latest CNN/ORC poll, support for a constitutional right for same sex marriage jumped to 74% for Democrats and 69% for Independents.  Republicans have also moved towards supporting same sex marriage, but a majority remains opposed. The May CNN/ORC poll showed that 60% of Republicans do not support a constitutional right to same sex marriage; in the 2010 CNN/ORC poll, 73% of Republicans were against it.  Dividing the GOP  Complicating matters for the GOP is that same sex marriage is a divisive issue within its own party. It not only pits social conservatives against centrist-leaning Republicans, but also younger people against their parents and grandparents.  The May CNN/ORC poll showed that 59% of Republican and Republican-leaning independents under the age of 50 supported a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to marry, while 61% did not.  Growing support for same sex marriage among young Republicans, polling data and the fact it is already legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia is enough for some in the party to say it is time to let the issue go. In March, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, who is gay, and more than 300 GOP office holders, activists and operatives including former Illinois Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady submitted a brief to the Court expressing support for same sex marriage.  Brady, who stepped down as chairman in 2013 after sparring with social conservatives for supporting same sex marriage in Illinois, said it is not productive for the GOP to continue fighting this issue.  ""When we run as the party of big ideas we do very well,"" said Brady. ""Whether you agree or disagree on how the court has ruled, we need to focus on electing a Republican president.""  Still, there is strong opposition in the GOP when it comes embracing same sex marriage, and social conservatives want to put people on the record on this issue -- specifically those running for the White House.  ""We need to make sure we have presidential candidates standing up for religious liberty,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage.  Brown's organization will unveil a 2016 presidential pledge Thursday, asking candidates to publicly state their support for marriage between one man and one woman. He said they would begin contacting campaigns immediately asking them to sign the pledge, much like Mitt Romney and other GOP presidential candidates did in 2012.  Already, two Republican presidential candidates, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, have added their names to the Defend Marriage Pledge, the online document Smothermon and 50,000 other people have signed in which they vow to ignore the Court's ruling if it violates the teachings of their faiths.  ""A decision purporting to redefine marriage flies in the face of the Constitution and is contrary to the natural created order,"" reads the pledge. ""As people of faith we pledge obedience to our Creator when the State directly conflicts with higher law. We respectfully warn the Supreme Court not to cross this line.""  Dr. Rick Scarborough, who helped launch the Defend Marriage Pledge, said it is critical for people to come together to fight for religious liberty. Scarborough, founder of the Judeo-Christian advocacy organization Vision America, said he is concerned that the government will try to force people and organizations to ignore the teachings of their faith and accept same sex marriage. In addition, he warned that if the Court ruled in favor of same sex marriage, it would a ""slippery slope"" resulting in the enactment of new laws that would further encroach on people's religious liberties.  Scarborough noted that California and New Jersey have already passed laws in recent years outlawing ""reparative therapy,"" which supporters claim will help turn a person's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. (The American Psychiatric Association disagrees and opposes such treatment).  ""The real issue for us is the effort to silence us for what we believe is true,"" Scarborough said.  Ted Olson, former solicitor general of the United States under President George W. Bush, said he does ""not think anyone's religious liberty would be violated"" if the Court rules in favor of same sex marriage.  ""I do not believe someone would force a member of the clergy to perform a marriage,"" said Olson, who successfully argued to overturn California's prohibition on same sex marriage. But Olson did add that merchants would be prevented from asking personal questions of potential customers.  ""If you are in the commercial world, just as in the case of race, I do not think if you have a bake shop you can ask someone their sexual orientation,"" he said.  Issues for 2016  Opponents and supporters agree that regardless of how the Court rules on same sex marriage, the issue is not going away.  ""We will work to overturn any illegitimate Supreme Court ruling and we will make sure that folks understand that it is an illegitimate ruling by the Court,"" said Brown, who will be present outside the Court on the day of the ruling.  Adam Talbot, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, said his organization would continue to fight for equality even if the Court rules in favor of same sex marriage, because people who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender are ""still at risk for discrimination.""  And expect to hear same sex marriage and religious liberty discussed on the campaign trail in the coming months -- like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush each did this past week.  ""They turn their backs on gay people who love each other,"" Clinton said at a campaign rally over the weekend, accusing the Republican candidates of refusing to back same sex marriage.  Bush warned that if Clinton is elected president she would work to weaken their religious freedoms.  ""These have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience,"" Bush said. ""And the leading Democratic candidate recently hinted of more trouble to come. Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary those beliefs, quote, 'have to be changed.'  ""That's what she said, and I guess we should at least thank her for the warning."""

E475,1,State Of Florida Passes Law Which Makes Nudity Legal At All Public Beaches,"0  TALLAHASSEE, Florida-  The state of Florida has made a bold change to its laws concerning nudity at public beaches, and this one might ruffle some feathers. Beginning August 1st, full nudity will be legal at all public beaches – as long as you obtain a Florida State Nudity License (FSNL).  Governor Rick Scott approved the bill passed by the state legislature making public nudity at state-owned beaches legal, and he encourages tourists and residents to make use of new law. “Today is a great day. Not only will it be legal to hang out at the beach totally nude, but we encourage you do to so,” Governor Scott said. “As long as you are a fairly attractive person, nobody is going to complain.”  One part of the new law, which may be infuriating to some, is the weight limits for those who may strip down completely. “If you are overweight by more than twenty pounds, you will not be given a license. You will be politely asked to go on a diet and come back at a later date to try again. It really is not that complicated.” Scott said. “We want everyone to enjoy this. Obtaining a license will not be hard for those who meet all of our standards, and it will be a quick and easy process. Residents and guests in the state may visit any of our town halls, where we will have employees trained to record the weight of those wishing to go nude. You will also be asked to submit a picture of your face and genitals. If you’re not too ugly or fat, then they will issue you a license for a fee of only $10, which will be good for 1 year.”  Residents in several communities have said that they are really torn on the subject.  “On one hand, everyone likes to freeball it once in a while,” said Miami resident Jacob Miller, 58. “On the other hand, my wrinkly penis probably won’t pass the inspection, so I more than likely can’t get a license issued anyway. Thankfully, I live right on the beach, so even if I can’t be nude, I can enjoy all the fine young ladies who will be walking around, muffs exposed.”  0  Comments  comments"

When asked if he would be waiting in line again tomorrow, Morin replied, “I feel like such a chump even saying it, but probably.”  Social media chatter began building about the possible performance after Prince’s all-female band 3rdeyegirl posted a message to Twitter overnight, hinting at a possible Toronto date.  The message, which appeared to spell the city’s name backwards, was then removed this morning.  “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…,” it said.  Reached by CP24 Tuesday morning, officials at Massey Hall refused to either confirm or deny whether Prince would put on a surprise show at the venue.  A Ticketmaster page, however, said that Prince is performing at Massey Hall on Nov. 4, listing the event as “no longer on sale.”  Barricades were also set up outside the venue, though it was unclear whether the measure was in any way connected to the rumoured show.  “I got up at 4:30 a.m. because I had a Twitter alert wake me up from his band with a cryptic message saying they were on their way to Toronto. That was enough for me,” one of the fans lined up outside Massey Hall Tuesday morning told CP24. “Prince has redefined popular music for 40 years. Him and Miles Davis are the two greatest artists to ever live in my opinion.”  ""The drums are inside. That's what we heard,"" another fan in the lineup told CP24. ""It's going to be good.""  Prince last performed in Toronto in 2011.  Prince pulled this tweet, but I caught it. A Toronto surprise is coming.

pheme_182,1,Sydney Siege: Police Send Message To Captives,"A gunman who claims to have four bombs is holding up to 20 people hostage in complete darkness at a cafe in Sydney's financial district.  Chilling footage has emerged of a female hostage apparently trying to communicate with police by miming her throat being cut - while news channels have chosen not to broadcast a video of another hostage relaying the assailant's demands.  For the latest details as another group of hostages escapes, follow this link.  Worker (L) flees cafe and suspected gunman (R). Pics: Channel 9, Channel 7  Witnesses described seeing the hostages looking ""exhausted"" and ""absolutely petrified"".  But as night fell and the siege entered its 16th hour, the gunman, who has been named as Sheikh Man Haron Monis, turned off the lights, making it difficult to see what is going on inside the cafe.  Play video ""Hostage Makes Throat Slitting Sign"" Video: Hostage Makes Throat Slitting Sign  Up to 100 armed police are at the scene while negotiators talk to the hostage taker.  New South Wales Police commissioner Andrew Scipione had this message for those inside: ""Rest assured we are doing all we can to set you free. We will be looking after your safety as our number one priority.""  :: Follow live updates of the siege  The siege began at 10am (local time) when Monis - who was previously known to both Sydney police and media - entered the Lindt cafe in Martin Place carrying a pump-action shotgun.  Shortly afterwards, hostages were seen holding a black flag with white Arabic text similar to those displayed by Islamic State.  Play video ""Escaping The Sydney Cafe Gunman"" Video: Escaping The Sydney Cafe Gunman  Footage showed Monis apparently using one hostage as a human shield.  Channel Ten spoke to two hostages who said the assailant is claiming to have bombs - two inside the cafe and two elsewhere in the financial district.  Police are investigating reports Monis has used hostages' social media accounts to demand a meeting with Australian Prime Minster Tony Abbott.  Some of the hostages have spoken to their families on mobile phones - while five, three male customers and two female staff, have managed to escape.  Journalist Chris Reason, who has a view of the cafe from the Channel 7 building, said the gunman was ""extremely agitated"" when the hostages fled.  1 / 49 Gallery: Latest Images From Australia A bomb disposal robot moves towards Sydney's Lindt Cafe after armed police moved in to end the seige in a barrage of gunfire.  But he told Sky News the cafe had now ""gone completely black"" - although he could make out a man, thought to be the hostage taker, holding an iPad.  ""We can see very little of what is going on inside, which is obviously not good news,"" said Mr Reason.  ""From our position over the last couple of hours we have counted 15 hostages in total. Five of those have escaped.  ""They are all ages, all demographics. Fortunately no children that we could see.""  Mr Reason said the gunman had been forcing hostages to stand at the window with their hands against the glass - and that they were rotated every two hours.  Play video ""'They Put ISIS Sign On The Window'"" Video: 'They Put ISIS Sign On The Window'  One woman in that position looked like she had been ""crying her heart out"", he said.  One of the gunman's reported demands is that an IS flag be brought to the cafe.  Police have confirmed they are working ""on a footing"" it is a terrorist incident - but they remain ""confident"" a peaceful resolution can be achieved.  NSW Police deputy commissioner Catherine Burn described it as a ""sensitive negotiation"".  Food has now been taken into the cafe for the hostages, none of whom are thought to have been harmed.  Play video ""Man Came Face-To-Face With Gunman"" Video: Man Came Face-To-Face With Gunman  Analysing why police had not taken out the gunman, Sky's Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said: ""There are tactical reasons for that.  ""If he says there's a bomb inside the building, he may have a dead man’s switch. In other words, if he's shot dead it could go off.""  The Australian Prime Minister has convened the National Security Committee for emergency briefings.  ""This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,"" said Mr Abbott.  In the hours since the siege began, a social media campaign has been trending globally, with people posting the hashtag #illridewithyou to show solidarity with Muslims.  Play video ""Map - Sydney Siege Location"" Video: Map - Sydney Siege Location  In a separate development, a 25-year-old man was arrested on alleged terrorism offences in Sydney a few hours before the siege began.  He was seized as part of ""continuing investigations into the planning of a terrorist attack on Australian soil and the facilitation of travel of Australian citizens to Syria to engage in armed combat"".  The arrest - reportedly as the man left a prayer hall - comes three months after the Australian government raised its terror threat level and conducted large-scale counter-terror raids across the country.

E384,1,Planned Parenthood,"Following the release of the second Planned Parenthood undercover video last week, Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina joined Jake Tapper on The Lead.  Tapper asked Fiorina to define her position on Governor Walker’s recent bill that prohibits abortions after twenty weeks and makes no exclusions for instances of rape and incest.  Rather than taking the let’s connect Fiorina to what the left believes is an extremist pro-life position bait, Fiorina directed attention to a bill bouncing around the Senate floor, “let’s talk about the legislation that’s sitting on the Senate floor right now which does allow for those exceptions,” she responded.  Tapper interrupted, attempting yet again to pin Fiorina to Walker’s bill. Fiorina would have no part of it and kept talking.  “Let’s also talk about Hillary Clinton’s position. Let’s talk about what extreme is. It’s not a life until it leaves the hospital, that’s Hillary Clinton’s position. It’s Hillary Clinton’s position that a 13-year-old girl needs her mother’s permission to go to a tanning salon or get a tattoo, but not to get an abortion. It’s Hillary Clinton’s position that women should not be permitted to look at an ultrasound before an abortion, and yet people who are trying to harvest body parts can use an ultrasound to make sure that those body parts are preserved so they can be sold. That Jake, is extreme.”  “I would really be delighted if for once, the media would ask Hillary Clinton about the extremism of her position.”  It seems fair to me. If the media is allowed to have their talking points, we should have the same luxury. Fiorina exemplifies the art of gracefully bucking a predetermined narrative while simultaneously making her own points.

E554,1,What do your mouth and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch have in common?,"Much like the Great Lakes, your mouth is full of microbeads — you know, those tiny particles lurking in your favorite face washes. It turns out they’re in your toothpaste, too — and that’s not a good thing.  Mother Jones has the story:  In March 2014, dental hygienist and blogger Trish Walraven sounded the alarm with a article about how she was finding “bits of blue plastic in my patients’ mouths every single day.” The plastic, she wrote, came from Crest toothpaste, and it was getting stuck in patients’ gums. Now, dentists are concerned that the microbeads trap bacteria, possibly causing gingivitis.  (Note: This revelation resulted in a resounding “DAMN IT” around the Grist office.)  Thankfully, Crest pledged to remove the microplastics from their toothpastes by next year, Mother Jones reported.  But gingivitis might not be the worst of it. The Environmental Working Group shares that microplastics could also be estrogen-mimicking hormone disruptors. While that doesn’t bode well for humans, the beads are also bad news for fish. The particles find their way into lakes and oceans where they soak up toxins and are eaten by some of our favorite entrees like tuna and swordfish, as seen in the video above by 5 Gyres, an ocean health advocacy group.  Thankfully, a number of states are rallying to ban sales of products containing microbeads and other non-biodegradable exfoliants. While it might seem far off, big cosmetics companies – Johnson & Johnson, L’Oreal, and Proctor & Gamble, to name a few – also promised to phase out microplastics from their products over the next few years.  But in the meantime, there are plenty of beadless toothpastes out there to keep those chompers squeaky clean. Tiny bits of plastic in your teeth are truly gross, anyway."

pheme_1,1,Prince fans turned away from Massey Hall,"Hundreds of Prince fans who lined up for hours outside Massey Hall had their hopes dashed Tuesday afternoon when promoter Live Nation confirmed on Twitter that there would be no concert that night after all.  Fans of the pop legend reported being turned away without tickets or wristbands — and no word on whether a surprise show would be scheduled for Wednesday.  “When we were told very abruptly after seven hours of waiting that ‘Prince would not be playing Massey Hall this evening’ and they were ‘taking the barricades down,’ it was quite shocking that there was no more information given,” said Rebecca Webster, a local music publicist who was near the front of the line on Tuesday.  “I don’t know who is at fault for that. When I left, there were a lot of people determined that there was a show that evening.”  Indeed, there were still some diehards lined up outside Massey Hall at 7:30 p.m. in the rain, a testament to the dedication of Prince’s fans.  In a Facebook post Tuesday night, promoter Live Nation apologized for “any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today.”  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal,” the post said. “There was no concert scheduled for today.”  A statement from 3rdeyegirl, Prince’s collaborating band, on Tuesday evening added: “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances . . .  “We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  But it was 3rdeyegirl that helped cause the commotion to begin with. Social media had picked up on the rumour early Tuesday morning after the band issued a cryptic tweet with Toronto spelled backwards: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING. . . ”  The tweet was quickly deleted around 8:30 a.m., but not before it spread like wildfire online.  Many posted on social media that tickets to the show would reportedly cost $10 and only the first 200 people in line would be let in. Others said there could be a pair of shows performed by Prince: one Tuesday night and another Wednesday.  Scott Morin, a 40-year-old jazz record label manager and lifelong Prince fan, said he was tipped off about the show when his Google Alerts awoke him Monday night to inform him of the 3rdeyegirl tweet.  He said he quickly mobilized a handful of friends, also Prince aficionados, and made it to the front of the Massey Hall lineup by 7:45 a.m.  “I figured there would be quite a lineup, but there were only a few people, so we lucked out,” he said while motioning to the hundreds and counting who had lined up behind him in the hours after.  Rebecca Webster had made it to Massey Hall at 8 a.m. to find herself fourth in line. She and her friends figured the rumours were plausible.  “The venue (Massey Hall) was available, the artist was nearby (New York) and the style of the announcement was very in keeping with how he likes to do things,” she said. “When we arrived there was full security detail and barriers set up. So we waited.”  And waited. And waited.  Webster says she often works with high-profile touring artists.  “I’ve managed guest lists for ‘surprise shows’ and most of the time they are kept fairly secret within the own artist camps as everyone has a hard time keeping a secret. What I’m saying is, it’s not an easy task to execute this kind of thing.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  Morin noted that this wouldn’t have been the first time Prince played a secret show.  In February last year, the performer played two consecutive surprise sets at the Electric Ballroom in London, England, and in British folksinger Lianne La Havas’s home.  Those shows were also sparked by a cryptic tweet from 3rdeyegirl.  With files from Ben Rayner  Read more about:"

E433,1,Black Panther Massacre on 9/11,"FACT CHECK: Are Black Panthers planning to kill white students and teachers on 9/11?  Claim: Black Panthers are planning to kill white students and teachers on 9/11.  PROBABLY FALSE  Example: [Collected via Facebook, September 2015]  Origins: A warning about “Black Panthers” having been “given the order to go into schools and colleges and kill all the white kids and teachers” on 9/11 (supposedly issuing from “General Greg Black” at the University of South Carolina Aiken) hit social media in early September 2015:  ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION JUST GOT A CALL FROM A VERY GOOD FRIEND HE WORKS FOR THE NSA AND DHS HE TOLD ME THAT ALL GOVT AGENCYS HAVE BEEN PUT ON HIGH ALERT FOR 9/11 I KNOW THIS IS NOTHING UNUSUAL BUT HE STATED THIS I QUOTE. “THE BLACK PANTHERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO GO INTO SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND KILL ALL TO WHITE KIDS AND TEACHERS THEYVE ALSO BEEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO KILL ALL WHITE COPS AND CRACKERS” UNQUOTE I URGE YOU TO ALL STAY IN GROUPS OF ATLEAST 4 MORE IF POSSIBLE IVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT IN THE UNION, GAFFNEY SPARTANBURG AREAS THAT GANG MEMBERS ARE BUILDING UP TO ATTACK WHITE PEOPLE ON 9/11 PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY PLEASE THIS IS A DIRECT ORDER FOR YOUR CHILDS SAFETY! MAKE SURE YOU ARE ARMED AT ALL TIMES! THE COMMANDERS ARE SETTING UP QRFs (QUICK REACTION FORCES) TO RESPOND TO ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE THANK YOU GENERAL GREG BLACK USCA S.C. COMMANDING  The message echoes countless other false rumors about black gang members supposedly planning murder sprees involving the killing of innocent, randomly-selected (white) victims. Police in the South Carolina cities mentioned in the warning (Union, Gaffney, Spartanburg) told us they had no information indicating that “Black Panthers” or “gang members” were planning to attack schools in the area on Monday, 11 September 2015, and that parents were not being advised to keep their children home from school that day (which is actually a Friday, not a Monday).  Some radical groups have been promoting a #FYF911 protest against “imperial powers” on 9/11, but that protest involves burning flags, not invading schools to murder people:  We, the people, are psychologically and physically breaking free of the imperialist, colonialist, and racist empires by burning representations starting on September 11th 2015. Why September 11th? We recognize that these imperial powers attacked their own citizens on 9/11 in an attempt to gain more power from its people. We are not disrespecting any citizen that may have died during these attacks on this day,instead we are acknowledging that, from this day forward, we are holding ALL imperial nations responsible for their needless deaths! On 9/11 we will be burning American flags, confederate flags, police uniforms, and ALL representations of organized evil and oppressive nations. We also will be raising the Liberation flag and building on a new nation for the people. This is an INTERNATIONAL movement and a day of unity, progressive action, and liberation. To all OPPRESSIVE AND ORGANIZED EVIL after #FYF911 the people will not be bound to you any longer!! FUCK YOUR FLAG!! Hastag #FYF911 to see what people are doing in your area  The original Black Panther Party for Self-Defense created in the mid-1960s essentially ended in the early 1980s, by which time membership had dwindled to a couple of dozen members. The New Black Panther Party originated in Dallas in 1989 and disclaims a relationship with the original. Some members of the New Black Panther Party have engaged in protests (during which they ostentatiously carried firearms) over the killings of unarmed blacks by police, but they have not advocated the wholesale slaughter of innocent white schoolchildren and teachers as a form of revenge.  On 8 September 2015, Cherokee Co. Sheriff Steve Mueller said the rumors were “not credible.”  Last updated: 10 September 2015  Originally published: 4 September 2015"

E189,1,Marco Rubio Voted For Bill Forcing Rape Victims To Publish Sexual History,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R) was among the Florida state legislators who voted for the so-called “Scarlet Letter” law in 2001 that required single mothers to publish their sexual histories in the newspaper in order to place their babies up for adoption.  Five U.S. congressmen – Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R), Lois Frankel (D), Jeff Miller (R), Gus Bilirakis (R) and Dennis Ross (R) – were state legislators at the time and voted for the controversial bill. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D), Frederica Wilson (D), Daniel Webster (R), and Bill Posey (R), who were also state legislators back then, voted against it.  The law, which passed with overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate, required unwed moms who wished to put their babies up for adoptions to post details about their recent sexual encounters in the newspaper in an attempt to contact the father, even if the woman was a victim of rape or incest. The purpose of the bill was to inform estranged biological fathers that their children were being adopted and give them the chance to intervene.  See Also: Chris Christie: “College Girls Can Sell Themselves To Pay Tuition”  The “Scarlet Letter” law gained media attention this week after The Huffington Post reported that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) had advocated for the public shaming of unwed parents in his 1995 book. Bush allowed the controversial law to go into effect in 2001, but signed a repeal of it two years later after it was successfully challenged in court.  The fact that Rubio, a 2016 presidential candidate, supported the bill could inoculate Bush from criticism that he allowed it to go into effect if Bush decides to throw his hat in the ring."
E564,1,Sarah Palin Prefers Slavery To Planned Parenthood,"If there is one thing that Donald Trump can be credited with, it’s sucking all the air out of the media and preventing every other right-wing lunatic from advancing their ultra-conservative agenda. In order to get any attention from the tabloid-obsessed press, it’s necessary to be even more bizarro than The Donald himself. The Republican candidates for president are finding this out in a big a way, and now so is has-been, half-governor, VP-flop, reality show loser, Sarah Palin.  Palin’s entry in the 2015 Trumplympics is a Facebook posting that features images of a Confederate flag and the Planned Parenthood logo. Her caption reads: “Which symbol killed 90,000 black babies last year?”      Of course, it’s a trick question because everyone knows that symbols don’t kill people, people do. And the people behind the Confederate flag were responsible for killing millions of African-Americans before, during, and after the Civil War. In fact, as we saw last month in Charleston, South Carolina, they are still doing it.  On the other hand, Planned Parenthood cannot be shown to have killed anyone. The premise of the anti-choice activists that life begins at conception, has never been proven scientifically. And abortion is still a legal means of terminating a pregnancy that has resulted in saving untold numbers of lives of women who would otherwise have been relegated to back alleys and medical charlatans.  Palin’s desperation for attention has compelled her to make one of the most nauseating ideological comparisons imaginable. The pro-choice movement is not unaccustomed to vile attacks including associations with historic evils like the Holocaust. It would be bad enough if Palin were trying to smear Planned Parenthood by asserting that it was somehow like the loathsome racists of the Confederacy. But she isn’t. She’s actually arguing that slaveholders and their descendants are praiseworthy next to an organization that provides health care, cancer screenings, birth control, and even prenatal services for women.  Planned Parenthood not only doesn’t kill people, it saves lives every day. What Palin is engaged in now is a coordinated right-wing attack on Planned Parenthood to destroy it by cutting off federal funding. In reality, this effort is another front in the Republican War On Women. Yet defunding Planned Parenthood would have almost no effect on abortion in America. That’s because only 3% of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortion related. It is the other vital health care services that women rely on that will be constrained if Palin and her GOP pals in Congress get their way. And, ironically, the result would be not only more women suffering with undiagnosed or untreated illnesses, but more unwanted or unplanned pregnancies.  In addition to the Confederate worship, Palin posted another graphic that reads: “80% of Planned Parenthood clinics located in minority neighborhoods.” What this tells us is that, not only is Palin an abhorrent racist, she is also an ignorant purveyor of virulent myths. The message she is passing along here is a favorite of organized bigots. It has also been proven to be untrue by many independent sources. One of them, Factcheck.org, researched similar claims and wrote that “There’s no evidence that was true then. And today, only 9 percent of U.S. abortion clinics are in neighborhoods where half or more of residents are black.” But Palin couldn’t be bothered with doing her own research and presenting the facts.  News Corpse Presents: The ALL NEW 2nd volume of  Fox Nation vs. Reality: The Fox News Cult of Ignorance.  Available now at Amazon.  It’s not a coincidence that Palin’s flurry of Facebook posts were joined together by their connection to racist propagandists. But even for her it is somewhat surprising that she would so openly embrace such bigotry. And the explanation has to be that she has been despondent since being jettisoned by Fox News and getting upstaged by Trump. So she’s doing what she has to do get her dimwitted minions to notice her again. Buckle up, kids. This could get ugly….er….uglier."
pheme_160,1,No Prince concert: Live Nation apologizes for 'incorrect' information,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.

E663,1,Christian Couple’s Plan to Divorce if Australia Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage Isn’t Going So Well,"Last week, Australians Nick and Sarah Jensen made international headlines when they said that if gay marriage was legalized in their country, they would get a divorce after ten years together. I guess that would show that legalizing gay marriage clearly affects straight ones.  If you read the fine print to the story, then you also knew they were still going to live together, still planning on having more children, and still going to call each other “husband” and “wife.”  Since then, we’ve learned a few more things about the legal aspects to their faux-divorce.  For one, it wouldn’t even be valid:  … the Family Law Act states that an application for divorce will only be considered if the parties had separated and lived separately for a continuous period of at least 12 months. Family lawyer Denis Farrar said the court also needs to be satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed. “It surprises me that any sensible person would make such a threat, because you can’t get a divorce unless you’ve been separated for 12 months,” he said. “It doesn’t sound like Mr Jensen could truthfully swear that those facts are correct. And in that case he may apply for a divorce, but he won’t get it unless he lies.”  In this case, gay marriage would hurt straight marriage by stopping a straight couple from divorcing… And that’s a sentence that only makes sense when you use Twisted Christian Logic.  We also learned that the couple’s close friend uninvited them from her own wedding because they’re an embarrassment to her:  After stewing over it over dinner last night, my fiance and I have decided the best thing to do is to make sure Nick understands how little he and his twisted world view matters. Couples all over the world of mixed race, mixed religion and now, at least in some countries, the same sex, enjoy a married life their forebears could not have dreamt would one day happen — and Nick and Sarah’s sham divorce will have zero impact on their lives. None. Nick says that his statement is neither a protest nor a threat, but simply “something we’re explaining is the consequence of any change in legislation”. Well, Nick, I’m sure you’ve come to appreciate over the past 48 hours that it’s not just changes to legislation that have consequences. Newspaper articles do, too. And here’s one of them, albeit a small one — I don’t want you anywhere near my wedding. You and your views are not welcome, because you’re right — the institution we’re marrying into isn’t the same one you think you’re in.  This whole attempt at making a statement has royally backfired. Good. It just proves how legalizing same-sex marriage offers so many benefits to so many people with so few (if any) downsides. I guess we can thank the Jensens for making that even more obvious than before.  "

E584,1,Obama collecting personal data for a secret race database,"A key part of President Obama’s legacy will be the fed’s unprecedented collection of sensitive data on Americans by race. The government is prying into our most personal information at the most local levels, all for the purpose of “racial and economic justice.”  Unbeknown to most Americans, Obama’s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school — all to document “inequalities” between minorities and whites.  This Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make “disparate impact” cases against: banks that don’t make enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks; cities that don’t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds.  Big Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online.  So civil-rights attorneys and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of “racial disparities” and “segregation,” even if no other evidence of discrimination exists.  Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history.  Housing database  The granddaddy of them all is the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing database, which the Department of Housing and Urban Development rolled out earlier this month to racially balance the nation, ZIP code by ZIP code. It will map every US neighborhood by four racial groups — white, Asian, black or African-American, and Hispanic/Latino — and publish “geospatial data” pinpointing racial imbalances.  The agency proposes using nonwhite populations of 50% or higher as the threshold for classifying segregated areas.  Federally funded cities deemed overly segregated will be pressured to change their zoning laws to allow construction of more subsidized housing in affluent areas in the suburbs, and relocate inner-city minorities to those predominantly white areas. HUD’s maps, which use dots to show the racial distribution or density in residential areas, will be used to select affordable-housing sites.  HUD plans to drill down to an even more granular level, detailing the proximity of black residents to transportation sites, good schools, parks and even supermarkets. If the agency’s social engineers rule the distance between blacks and these suburban “amenities” is too far, municipalities must find ways to close the gap or forfeit federal grant money and face possible lawsuits for housing discrimination.  Civil-rights groups will have access to the agency’s sophisticated mapping software, and will participate in city plans to re-engineer neighborhoods under new community outreach requirements.  “By opening this data to everybody, everyone in a community can weigh in,” Obama said. “If you want affordable housing nearby, now you’ll have the data you need to make your case.”  Mortgage database  Meanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, headed by former Congressional Black Caucus leader Mel Watt, is building its own database for racially balancing home loans. The so-called National Mortgage Database Project will compile 16 years of lending data, broken down by race, and hold everything from individual credit scores and employment records.  Mortgage contracts won’t be the only financial records vacuumed up by the database. According to federal documents, the repository will include “all credit lines,” from credit cards to student loans to car loans — anything reported to credit bureaus. This is even more information than the IRS collects.  The FHFA will also pry into your personal assets and debts and whether you have any bankruptcies. The agency even wants to know the square footage and lot size of your home, as well as your interest rate.  FHFA will share the info with Obama’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which acts more like a civil-rights agency, aggressively investigating lenders for racial bias.  The FHFA has offered no clear explanation as to why the government wants to sweep up so much sensitive information on Americans, other than stating it’s for “research” and “policymaking.”  However, CFPB Director Richard Cordray was more forthcoming, explaining in a recent talk to the radical California-based Greenlining Institute: “We will be better able to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns.”  Credit database  CFPB is separately amassing a database to monitor ordinary citizens’ credit-card transactions. It hopes to vacuum up some 900 million credit-card accounts — all sorted by race — representing roughly 85% of the US credit-card market. Why? To sniff out “disparities” in interest rates, charge-offs and collections.  Employment database  CFPB also just finalized a rule requiring all regulated banks to report data on minority hiring to an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. It will collect reams of employment data, broken down by race, to police diversity on Wall Street as part of yet another fishing expedition.  School database  Through its mandatory Civil Rights Data Collection project, the Education Department is gathering information on student suspensions and expulsions, by race, from every public school district in the country. Districts that show disparities in discipline will be targeted for reform.  Those that don’t comply will be punished. Several already have been forced to revise their discipline policies, which has led to violent disruptions in classrooms.  Obama’s educrats want to know how many blacks versus whites are enrolled in gifted-and-talented and advanced placement classes.  Schools that show blacks and Latinos under-enrolled in such curricula, to an undefined “statistically significant degree,” could open themselves up to investigation and lawsuits by the department’s Civil Rights Office.  Count on a flood of private lawsuits to piggyback federal discrimination claims, as civil-rights lawyers use the new federal discipline data in their legal strategies against the supposedly racist US school system.  Even if no one has complained about discrimination, even if there is no other evidence of racism, the numbers themselves will “prove” that things are unfair.  Such databases have never before existed. Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history. He is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society.  The first black president, quite brilliantly, has built a quasi-reparations infrastructure perpetually fed by racial data that will outlast his administration.  Paul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of “The Great American Bank Robbery,” which exposes the racial politics behind the mortgage bust."

E465,1,"After Josh Duggar's Ashley Madison confession, sister Jessa shares biblical verses","Josh Duggar's sister Jessa Duggar Seewald shared a biblical passage on her Instagram account on Sunday in her first post since her older brother confessed his adultery and use of the Ashley Madison website.  Jessa, 22, who was molested by her brother when she was a child and is expecting her first baby with husband Ben, shared a few verses from the New Testament about sin and forgiveness.  She posted a photo of an open bible with several verses underlined that read: 'If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.'  Broke her silence: Jessa Duggar, pictured with husband Ben Seewald, shared verses from the bible about sin and forgiveness in the wake of brother Josh confessed to adultery and viewing of online porn  Biblical teaching: Jessa posted this photo on her Instagram account of a copy of the New Testament open at the First Epistle Of John with several verses underlined  'But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanest us from all sin.'  The passage continues: 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'  It's unclear if the verses are meant to show forgiveness for Josh now he has owned up to his sins or an admonition to him for his deception and untruthfulness to his wife Anna and the wider Duggar family.  'Biggest hypocrite ever': Josh, 27, admitted he cheated on his wife Anna throughout their seven year marriage and while he worked for a conservative Christian lobby group focused on family values in Washington, D.C.  Defending: Jessa, 22, appeared on Fox News in June to talk about the revelation that when she was a child, Josh had molested her and several other underage girls  Back in June, Jessa vigorously defended Josh when she appeared on Fox News with her older sister Jill Duggar Dillard in the wake of the revelation he had molested five young girls, including his sisters, when he was a teenager.  Jessa described his inappropriate touching of her when she was about nine as 'mild' and a result of 'bad choices.'  On Thursday, Josh, whose fourth child with Anna was born just one month ago, admitted to cheating on his wife over the course of their marriage after he was named as one of 37 million cheating spouses alleged to have Ashley Madison accounts.  Forgiving: Jessa and her sister Jill made excuses for their brother's behavior, calling the touching 'mild,' and told host Megyn Kelly they had forgiven him for what he did  In the original statement he released after his use of the website was revealed, the 27-year-old said: 'I have been the biggest hypocrite ever.'  'While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.'  He went on: 'I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt, pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family, and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him.'  However he later changed his statement in an attempt to erase his admission of a porn addiction.  Newest arrival: Just four weeks ago, Josh welcomed his fourth child with Anna, baby Meredith Grace, seen here in a photo posted on the Duggar Family Official Facebook page  Sorry: The eldest of the 19 Duggar kids, Josh now has four kids of his own. He has apologized for the 'pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family.' Pictured are Michael, Marcus and McKynzie with their parents  Coincidentally, sex and forgiveness were the theme of the pastor's sermon at the Duggar's church on Sunday.  Jessa's sister Jill, who is working as a missionary in El Salvador with husband Derick Dillard, encouraged her social media followers to tune in, tweeting a link to where people could watch the service live.  Ronnie Floyd, the senior pastor of Cross Church in Springdale, Arkansas, spoke on the theme of Sex Today and, according to People, he blamed the sexual revolution and the media for the breakdown in family and biblical values.  'This sexual revolution is altering mindsets, undermining the family, influencing the culture and is a mockery to Biblical truth,' Floyd said. 'We're in a sexual epidemic of unprecedented proportions in this country.'  Floyd preached that a husband and wife should maintain 'sexual contact' and keep each other happy or risk an unsatisfied spouse looking elsewhere for gratification.  Sermon fodder: Jill Duggar tweeted a link to the live broadcast of Pastor Ronnie Floyd's Sunday service at Cross Church in Springdale, Arkansas, where he preached on Sunday about sex, sin and forgiveness  Floyd has previously shown support for the Duggars after Josh admitted to 'wrongdoing' in his past, telling People that things like the molestation scandal 'have happened before and will happen again.'  Meanwhile, the ongoing scandals caused by Josh's action are casting a long shadow over Jessa's first year of marriage and birth of her first child due on November 1, her wedding anniversary.  When her sister Jill gave birth to son Israel in April, she got her own TLC reality special.  But now, instead of being the center of attention and the focus of a reality show, as she had anticipated, she finds herself dealing with the ongoing fallout of her brother's actions including the cancellation of 19 Kids And Counting.  'She was in such a joyous moment in her life. Instead the show isn't there to chronicle this happy time,' an unnamed source told People last week. 'So much has changed for Jessa compared to what Jill experienced and it can't be changed back. And that's sad for her.'"
pheme_311,1,No Prince concert: Live Nation apologizes for 'incorrect' information,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York.

pheme_51,1,"Prince not playing Massey Hall tonight, promoter says","Live Nation and others have poured cold water on rumours that Prince would play a surprise show tonight in Toronto — issuing statements and apologies via Twitter that ended a day's worth of buzz, rumour and confusion.  ""Prince will not be performing at [Massey Hall] tonight,"" the concert promoter tweeted shortly before 3 p.m., news that dampened the spirits of thousands of fans who had waited in line for hours, in the rain.  It all started early Tuesday when 3rdEyeGirl — Prince's all-female live band — tweeted this cryptic message: ""4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…"".  Donna Grantis, far left, a Toronto native very well respected throughout the city's blues and rock scenes, plays in 3rdEyeGirl, who are currently touring with Prince. (Handout/Canadian Press)  The tweet was deleted shortly after 8:30 a.m., but it sent shock waves through Toronto-area Prince fans. The veteran musician played surprise gigs in Europe earlier this year, and once called Toronto home.  Fans were convinced. But after Live Nation made its announcement, they were left wondering what had happened.  ""Maybe he's just got a flat tire somewhere, who knows?"" said one.  ""We can't really blame anybody because all of this is based on speculation,"" said another.  Band apologizes  Members of 3rdEyeGirl tweeted apologies later that evening.  ""For all those who waited in line, I apologize for any disappointment caused by the confusion,"" tweeted guitar player Donna Grantis, a well-known Toronto blues player with musical connections throughout the city.  Drummer Hannah Welton added the day's events were ""a total mix up"" and that, ""there was never a show confirmed.""  CBC News was unable to confirm what was going on, but a CBC cameraman at Massey Hall said a drum kit emblazoned with Prince's famous symbol was being set up on stage. The cameraman and a CBC reporter were then asked to leave the venue.  A news release issued by 3rdEyeGirl added that its equipment had been set up ""to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances.""  One Prince fan who heard about the show on Twitter told CBC he's waiting because he's ""loved Prince for 25 years.""  ""His career spans so many different grooves and styles. I love all of it,"" said the fan, who identified himself only as Tom.  On Saturday, Prince and 3rdEyeGirl played a much-applauded, extended seven-minute set on Saturday Night Live.  Prince himself lived in Toronto for several years in the early 2000s while he was married to Toronto native Manuela Testolini. The pair divorced in 2006."

E262,1,Corona del Troll,"Claim: A high school in Tempe, Arizona banned patriotic apparel and Trump shirts from a football game.  FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail and Facebook, October 2015]  I just read on FB that a Public School in Tempe, AZ Banned ALL Patriotic Banners and the United States Flag!!! PLEASE, tell me this is not True!!! Anxiously awaiting your reply. ____________________________________________________________________ This is happening in Tempe, AZ this evening…. Corona Del Sol and Marcos De Niza high has banned patriotic gear for tonight’s game. Show up in your RED WHITE AND BLUE BEST to protest this censorship! We rally at 6pm during ticket sales to make sure every America loving student is granted entry into the event! People need to use the invite tab. Not just share the event. They need to invite people individually so people will be forced to respond with a going or not going. ____________________________________________________________________ Are they afraid of offending muslims or Hispanics? I would wear an American shirt under my jacket and take off the jacket once inside. Doesn’t this sound like a communist school?  Origins: On 22 and 23 October 2015, web sites including The Daily Caller, The Blaze, and Breitbart published articles claiming that Corona del Sol High School in Tempe, Arizona instituted a ban on a litany of “patriotic” apparel during a then-upcoming football game. The purported ban was wide-ranging and included “[anything] green, USA, flags, Trump, etc.”  While the rumor spread quickly and broadly on social media, credible supporting information was quite thin. The Blaze summarized all available information on the “patriotism ban” rumor — which appears to have originated not with the school’s administration, but in an editorial published in the school’s newspaper. Moreover, those web sites weren’t even able to confirm that such an editorial (the existence of which was evident only in screenshots) ever appeared in the school’s paper, much less that its claims were sanctioned by the administration:  Students at Tempe’s Corona del Sol High School reportedly were set to wear red, white and blue to the game at Marcos de Niza High School, also in Tempe, but an apparent editorial in the Corona del Sol student newspaper indicated that was forbidden. “It is the unfortunate truth that if you wear red, white or blue to the game you will not be admitted to the stadium,” the editorial said. “This is a fact.” A link to the editorial was not active Friday, but screenshots said to be of the editorial were posted on Twitter … When one person asked the newspaper staff for more specifics on what clothing shouldn’t be worn Friday night, the paper replied, “Anything perceived to be offensive/racist: green, USA, flags, Trump, etc. It’s not the clothing, but the intent behind it.”  The Twitter account (@CdSSunrise) from which much of the information purportedly originated remained active on 23 October 2015, but none of its tweets referenced the controversy. The account’s name (“Sunrise Staff”) may have suggested that it was operated by district staff, when in actuality it looked to belong to the paper’s staff (comprised of students).  On 23 October 2015, the district addressed the rumors on their official account:  Media reports of a ban of colors or flags @ tonight’s Corona del Sol vs. Marcos de Niza fball game are FALSE. NO ban. All colors are welcome — TUHSD Communications (@TUHSD_News) October 23, 2015  That same day, KTAR published an article titled “Phoenix-area school bans USA-themed clothing for rivalry game”; the title was later changed to “District denies Phoenix-area school ban of USA clothing for rivalry game.” The original title was still visible in earlier Twitter shares and on the article’s URL:  District denies Phoenix-area school ban of USA clothing for rivalry game. https://t.co/I3mX44362I — Brian M. Bergner Jr. (@SportsWriter52) October 23, 2015  That article also sourced its information not from administrators at the school, but from rumors among students. KTAR linked to a letter from Principal Brent Brown to parents [PDF], in which Brown reiterated that students should refrain from inappropriate chants or signs. However, that letter referenced an inter-school “rivalry,” and no portion of it could remotely be construed as a ban on patriotic apparel:  We expect our students to be respectful and we hope you’ll join us in discouraging inappropriate signs, chants or clothing. In an effort to support the TUHSDstrong campaign, and to support our football team, we’ve designated this game an “orange out” and invite you to proudly wear your Aztec orange and join us for a fun night of school pride.  Rumors of a ban on patriotic clothing (and, oddly, Donald Trump-related apparel) at the Tempe high school originated solely with students, and we were unable to find any official (or unofficial) communications from school officials suggesting it was rooted in fact. A letter from the principal reminded students to behave respectfully during the game, but no reference was made to “patriotism” or red, white, and blue.

E64,1,Walmart: Viral story about sad cashier not true,"A Colorado woman's Facebook post about her experience in a Walmart store has been shared more than 800,000 times since Friday but Walmart says while it's a sweet story, with a great message about kindness, it's simply not true.  In the video, entitled ""Pueblo Walmart changed my life"" Paige Yore explains that she was in line behind a woman who was being rude to a teenage cashier at the store.  ""I'm in downtown Pueblo at this Walmart, waiting in line for like 20 minutes. And this young cashier, 16 maybe... he can't ring anything up. He can't remember the codes, he's taking deep breaths ...""  ""I thought to myself, 'I wonder what the hell happened to him this morning?'"" Yore said.  Then, the female customer in front of her started yelling at the cashier, Yore said.  ""'You suck at customer service! I don't know how you even got hired here!' Just being so rude to this young man,"" Yore explains.  ""Finally, I help her get her groceries all loaded up just to get her the hell out of there, and she runs her card and it gets declined,"" said Yore. ""Then she really lays into this kid - that it's his fault, he can't work the computer ... she goes off on this kid.""  Yore said that's when she spoke up.  ""I was like, 'Ma'am, maybe you should just step aside, and let us cash out. This man's obviously having a bad day. Like, let it go, it's not his fault you don't have money, or whatever.'""  Yore said the young man stopped in his tracks and started sobbing. Then he came around the counter and hugged her.  Yore said she was a little ""weirded out"" but tried to comfort the crying cashier.  ""He finally gets it together, and I'm like 'It's OK, it's OK. Everybody has a rough day,'"" Yore explained.  ""And he's like 'No, no, no... you don't understand. Ma'am, my mom just committed suicide this morning. And I have to work because I have to pay our rent. And I have to pay our bills. And I don't even have a mom anymore.'""  Yore said at that point, she started crying, too.  ""I said 'You know, hang in there... it's going to be OK. It will be OK.'""  ""So this lady is standing there, totally humiliated... and this young man is just crying. I gave him all the money out of my purse. And he can't even get it together,"" Yore said, visibly moved.  ""That just showed me, no matter what, even if your customer service sucks, even if whatever happened, someone is rude to you, be YOUR customer service. Don't jump down their throat, because they are fighting a battle none of us know about.""  ""Some days just suck. But we just have to be thankful to be alive. Treat people like you want to be treated,"" said Yore. ""Don't lay into somebody like that because you never know what's going on in their life.""  -- Walmart debunks Yore's story --  While her message of kindness inspired hundreds of thousands of people to share her story, Walmart on Monday told Denver7 that the Yore was not telling the truth.  ""We have checked into this. It doesn't seem like it is actually true,"" said Walmart spokesman Aaron Mullins.  Mullins said Walmart has received lots of calls asking about the young man, and the company looked into the incident extensively, including reviewing the surveillance video.  He says surveillance video does show Yore shopping at the Pueblo store at 4080 West Northern Avenue on Friday, and going through a checkout line manned by a young cashier, but the truth stops there.  ""There was never a conversation about his mother. He never went around the bagging area and hugged her. He is in good health and his mother is in good health,"" Mullins said.  The cashier said he could not think of anything he had said that would have led Yore to think he was in pain.  ""I don't know if there was a misunderstanding. The associate wasn't exactly sure what she was talking about. His mother is alive and well,"" Mullins said.  While Mullins wouldn't speculate about why Yore made up the story, others on Facebook say she is seeking to grow her social media audience, and in her latest video posted on Sunday, Yore asks for more subscribers to her YouTube channel.  ""I have this crazy wild dream to change lives in this world, and to make this world a better place ... If you give power to positivity, power to God, power to prayer, power to your higher power, whatever it may be, it is going to go viral,"" Yore said. ""I cannot thank you from the bottom of my heart enough for sharing my inspiring words on Friday because it is going to change my life. I'm taking one more step to getting to my big goal. One more step to changing lives - because of you guys.""  ""Subscribe to my YouTube channels ... see my videos weekly and I hope to have another couple of experiences like I did Friday and be able to inspire some people,"" Yore concludes.  Yore called her initial video ""Pueblo Walmart changed my life."" You can watch it here:"
E276,1,London Fire Brigade issues ‘hoverboard’ safety warning on 'Back to the Future Day',"O n the day ‘the future’ finally becomes the present London Fire Brigade is warning hoverboard owners of the dangers posed by leaving the gadgets unattended while charging.  In cult classic film Back to the Future II, mad scientist Doc Brown takes Marty McFly to October 21, 2015, where people travelled using flying cars and kids owned hoverboards.  Although flying cars may not yet have been invented, the idea of hoverboards was not so far-fetched, given the recent rise in popularity of self balancing scooters.  However, today the Brigade is warning owners of the sought-after devices not to leave them charging unattended, after firefighters were called to two fires in two weeks involving personal transporters that were left on charge.  Blaze: the aftermath of the fire in Morden / LFB  On October 11, four fire engines and around 20 firefighters were called out to attend to a fire in the bedroom of a flat in Southwark,which involved an electric uni-cycle that was on charge.  The occupant discovered the fire after hearing a loud ‘bang’,and was able to escape the property uninjured.  Just days earlier two men escaped through a first floor window after a fire broke out at a house in Morden.  The mean heard a ‘banging’ noise, before discovering the a blaze in a room where a hoverboard had been charging.  Damage: another device caught fire in Southwark / LFB  Both of the devices involved in the fires have been sent for further testing by The Brigade’s fire investigation experts.  Last Thursday, the BBC's investigation programme Watchdog raised concerns about the plugs being supplied with some hoverboards, which did not appear to be standard British plugs.  The investigation found the plugs did not have fuses and could be at risk of overheating, exploding and catching fire."

Satire: ‘Brain-Dead Teen, Only Capable Of Rolling Eyes And Texting, To Be Euthanized’; Caitlin Teagart Death Not real  A video saying 13-year-old “Caitlin Teagart” will be euthanized because she’s “brain-dead” is nothing more than satire.  It was published on preeminent satirical website The Onion a few years ago but it again went viral on Friday.  A number of people apparently believed the video.  “The parents of 13-year old Caitlin Teagart have decided to end her life, saying she can now do nothing but lay on the couch and whine about things being ‘gay,'” it reads.  The post had more than 375,000 shares and “likes” on Facebook.  The Onion, which has been around since 1988 and has produced weekly newspapers and books, has a disclaimer.  “The Onion is a satirical weekly publication published 52 times a year on Thursdays,” it reads, adding: “The Onion uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”  On the Onion’s Facebook page, some users appeared to believe the satirical story.  “REALLY?? This has GOT to be a joke.. And it is a SICK one at that! She looks like any normal teenager to me,” one person wrote.  Added another: “How can you be brain dead and still text?I think something’s fishy.”"
E210,1,Oprah Winfrey's $43M Bet on Weight Watchers," -- Weight Watchers may be Oprah Winfrey's newest ""favorite thing."" Shares of Weight Watchers skyrocketed by as much as 90 percent with today's news that Winfrey bought a 10 percent stake in the company and has joined its board.  The media mogul, 61, bought 6.4 million shares of Weight Watchers at Friday's closing price of $6.49. The deal was worth more than $43 million.  Winfrey said in a statement, ""Weight Watchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for. I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.""  ""Through our conversations, it became clear that there is tremendous alignment between Oprah's intention and our mission,"" said Jim Chambers, Weight Watchers president and CEO, said in a statement. ""We believe that her remarkable ability to connect and inspire people to realize their full potential is uniquely complementary to our powerful community, extraordinary coaches and proven approach.""  Alex Fuhrman, senior research analyst with investment firm Craig-Hallum, said Winfrey's stake could influence consumers, and ultimately, Weight Watchers' bottom line.  ""Oprah is considered a very trusted name and brand advocate by consumers and she has a reputation by consumers who would only endorse a product if she really believed in it,"" Fuhrman said. ""In that sense, it could bring a lot of interest to Weight Watchers. She has a tremendous fan following.""  Fuhrman points out that any $43 million investment in Weight Watchers, regardless if it came from Winfrey or another investor, would have sent the stock higher. Weight Watchers has been struggling with declining sales and a looming debt of $144 million.  ""Definitely bringing on Oprah as a spokesperson of sorts with $43 million of cash puts to bed concern that it can pay its April 2016 debt,"" Fuhrman said.  Winfrey has had a strong influence on consumer products with her book club and former television feature ""Oprah's favorite things."" And now, she will be endorsing weight loss.  Weight Watchers hasn’t secured “an effective spokesperson ever since it hit a homerun with Jennifer Hudson back in late 2010,” J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a research note. Hudson, the former “American Idol” finalist, parted ways with the company last year.  Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said he was ""intrigued"" by the potential marketing opportunities with Winfrey's various television, print, and digital properties, but is waiting to hear more from the New York-based company.  While Winfrey's involvement ""is likely to resonate with Weight Watchers' traditional over-50 female demographic, it's unclear how the company plans to bolster its brand positioning with a younger audience,"" he wrote in a research note."

E251,1,There might be meat in your vegetarian hot dogs,"If you're already suspicious about what's in a hot dog, drilling down to the molecular level may be even more shocking.  According to food researchers at startup lab Clear Food, who tested 345 hot dog samples from 75 different food brands, 14.4 percent of hot dogs “were problematic in some way.”  Those problems include finding meat in hot dogs labeled as vegetarian and pork in dogs label as kosher. The report found human DNA in 2 percent of samples, two-thirds of which were vegetarian-labelled hot dogs.  To get the results, Clear Food used new technology to examine food at the molecular level which catches allergens and hidden additives other food tests can miss.  Clear Food identified other issues, including:  -- 3 percent of samples that claimed they did not have pork actually did contain pork (chicken products were especially “problematic”)  --Some vegetarian product labels “exaggerated the amount of protein” --with one item containing 2.5 times less than labeled.  --10 percent of vegetarian samples contained meat of some kind  The study also gave ratings to retailers and makers who provided the best quality dogs, singling out Trader Joe’s Soy Chorizo as the best option for vegetarians.  According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, Americans eat about 20 billion hot dogs each year. Last year, Americans spent $2.5 billion on hot dogs, another $2.74 billion on dinner sausages, and over half a billion on breakfast sausage.  Clear Labs is hoping to sell its services to companies that supply the food chain and plans to create a division that will tell consumers about what's in the food they buy in grocery stores.  The startup plans to release a series of reports, published once a month, that will establish a scoring system to indicate the accuracy of a brand's label in terms of ingredients, nutrients, and other information."
politifact14904,1,HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON ‘TOTAL STRIKE’ IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN,"Many of Hollywood’s elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President.  This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.  Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.  “The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,”Mike explained. “And they’re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.”  It’s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren’t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn’t about to change.  Let’s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn’t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump’s goals for his time in office they would feel different  Watch one news network’s story on the matter:"
E722,1,FACT CHECK: A (Not So) Secret Microchip?,"In June 2015, several videos claiming that Samsung had planted a secret microchip on their cell phone batteries in order to steal data and photographs from customers’ phones began circulating online:  Samsung users beware… Posted by Paint Fade on Monday, June 22, 2015  While it’s true that this video clip has not been doctored and there is indeed a coil beneath the wrapping of the batteries included with many Samsung phones, the claim that what’s seen here is a “secret microchip” used to steal data is false. The coil shown in the video is actually an NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna:  The tech involved is deceptively simple. Evolved from radio frequency identification (RFID) tech, an NFC chip operates as one part of a wireless link. Once it’s activated by another chip, small amounts of data between the two devices can be transferred when held a few centimeters from each other.  Although this antenna allows Samsung users to share small amounts of data between two devices, that usage is hardly a secret — it is plainly stated in Samsung advertisements:  NFC is used with many Google Android and Apple iPhone devices to enable applications such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet. It is also used to transfer photographs, contacts, and other small pieces of data.  When iFixit published their “tear down” of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, they included several videos of the battery and the NFC antenna:  Not only does the 3.7 V, 1750 mAh battery power the phone, but the user manual states that it also doubles as the NFC antenna. O RLY? We had to see this one for ourselves. Lo and behold, there’s a sweet antenna hiding underneath the battery’s shiny wrapper. So if you ever want to buy a replacement battery (and keep NFC functional), ensure that the battery has the antenna.  While there is a coil “hidden” in the wrapping surrounding most batteries included with Samsung phones, this is merely the NFC antenna and not a “secret microchip” used to steal data"
E774,1,Taco Bell Wicker Park Could Become First in U.S. to Serve Booze,"That Taco Bell planned for Wicker Park won't be so run of the mill after all. Management's applied for a liquor license, which would make it the first Bell in the world to serve alcohol with Doritos Locos Tacos and other menu items. A Yum! Brands spokeswoman added that The Bell's also planning a ""completely new urban restaurant design"" for the Wicker Park space.  Taco Bell had considered selling alcohol at other locations in the past. There were plans to offer boozy milkshakes at U.S. Taco Co. — TB's upscale concept in California that features lobster tacos and other premium items that no Fourth Meal eater has ever had at a regular Taco Bell — but those plans were postponed.  Back in February there were rumblings that only the second U.S. Taco Co. would land in the Wicker Park space at 1439 N. Milwaukee Ave., but a Yum! Brands rep shot that rumor down at the time, saying the Wicker Park restaurant would be a normal Taco Bell. But booze and this ""completely new design"" are anything but normal. The rep wouldn't offer up anymore details at this time.  Is Taco Bell dipping their tortillas in the same salsa as other upscale taco slingers in the area like Antique Taco and Big Star? And what types of alcoholic beverages would Taco Bell Wicker Park serve? The boozy milkshakes they had planned for U.S. Taco Co. or something different, perhaps margaritas with Doritos dust on the rim? Stay tuned—the restaurant is slated to open sometime this summer."

E620,1,Abandoned Polish Wedding Chairs,"A photograph depicts chairs left in a Polish forest after a 1939 wedding was canceled due to the start of World War II.  A tale about a photograph of still-cared-for chairs symbolizing a wedding in Poland that was called off due to the onset of World War II in 1939 is a poignant and touching narrative:  These chairs were laid out for a wedding in 1939 in Poland. The wedding was abandoned, and so were the chairs due to the German invasion. They were found again after the war with the trees growing through them. Every year they are repainted.  However, this is a false backstory that has become attached to an entirely unrelated image. (One would have wonder about the likelihood that all these chairs were somehow precisely located in spots where trees would later grow up between their seats and backs).  What is actually depicted here is an art installation (entitled “The Four Seasons of Vivaldi”) created along the road between Haut-bois and Faulx in Namur, Belgium, in 2001 by French conceptual artist/sculptor Patrick Demazeau.  Much of Demazeau’s work involves the juxtaposition of furniture and nature, which symbolizes the trees (who spend their lives standing) offering seats to share with the walkers and dreamers who come across them:"

The winner is who creates the greater hysteria among the adults around him. Meanwhile, the youngster has to avoid contacting anyone during those long 72 hours.

E319,1,Phallic mushroom releases 'hormone-like compounds' to excite with a single sniff,"Oysters and chocolate maybe considered aphrodisiacs, but their stimulating powers pale into insignificance when compared to a mysterious mushroom found in Hawaii.  An as yet unnamed species of bright orange mushroom that grows on volcanic slopes has long been rumoured to possess potent properties.  Researchers have discovered the 'fetid odour' of the fungus can trigger spontaneous climaxes in females.  Scroll down for video  A mysterious mushroom has been found to trigger orgasms in women. It may resemble Phallus multicolour (pictured), which is found in Hawaii. The unknown species has long been rumoured to have potent properties  The mushrooms were discovered growing on lava deposits dating back 600 and 10,000 years.  It is thought they belong to the genus Dictyophora, a family of mushrooms that bear distinctive net-like heads.  In a brief study, published in the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms in 2001, John Holliday of Next Laboratories in Kula, Hawaii and Noah Soule of Aloha Medicinals tested the mushroom's aphrodisiac effect.  In a small experiment involving 16 women and 20 men, volunteers were asked to sniff the mushroom, which is said to have a 'fetid odour'.  Its smell triggered spontaneous orgasms in six of the women, while the other 10, who received smaller doses, experienced an increase in heart rate, Snopes.com reported.  In a small experiment involving 16 women and 20 men, volunteers were asked to sniff the mushroom, which is said to have a 'fetid odour. Its smell triggered spontaneous orgasms (stock image) in six of the women  The study explained: 'There are significant sexual arousal characteristics present in the fetid odour of this unique mushroom.  'These results suggest that the hormone like compounds present in the volatile portion of the spore mass may have some similarity to human neurotransmitters during sexual encounters.'  However, commentators have noted that it was just one study and more work is needed to confirm the fungi's seemingly spectacular powers.  Interestingly Dictyophora mushrooms - also known as 'veiled ladies' - grow length so quickly that they can 'bloom' in just 45 minutes.  It is thought that the mushrooms produce the potent smells in order to reproduce.  Another mushroom from the same family, named Dictyophora indusiata, emits an unpleasant smell similar to faeces.  This specific branch of the fungus family has long been considered to possess special powers.  They were ingested during ancient Mexican divinatory ceremonies and in New Guinea the mushroom is considered sacred because of its suggestive form.  In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name 'Akufodewa' by the Yoruba people.  The name is formed from a combination of the Yoruba words: ku ('die'), fun ('for'), ode ('hunter'), and wa ('search').  It refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal.  In Chinese medicine the fungi has been used to treat many inflammatory, gastric, and neural diseases.  Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of conditions, including coughs, dysentery, enteritis and even leukemia."

Householders are leaving horse chestnuts on window ledges and under sofas in the belief that they scare off the spiders – but scientists have cast doubt on the theory.  The spider population has been expanding in the wake of the UK's washout summer, and millions are moving indoors as they seek a dry place to mate. Locals in Lancashire last week reported seven-inch long spiders 'as big as mice'.  A terrifying invasion of giant spiders (file photo) in homes across the country may soon be defeated by an unlikely enemy – the humble conker  The belief that spiders are scared off by conkers has led canny eBay users to cash in on the panic, with bags being sold for up to £20 a kilogram. One trader has already sold 150 lots.  Yet scientists are divided over whether the saponin compound found in conkers is an effective spider repellent, with some describing it as 'an old wives' tale'.  Spider expert Jack Fenwick said: 'The jury is out on whether it works but my cousin, who is very scared of spiders, tried conkers in her home and said it worked very well.'  Some experts say saponin gives the seeds a bitter taste and a smell that could act as a natural repellent.  The belief that spiders are scared off by conkers has led canny eBay users to cash in on the panic, with bags being sold for up to £20 a kilogram  A paper by German chemist Hartmut Foerster described the chemical as 'toxic' to insects.

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?  There is modest irony in the fact that Scott Walker hopes to revive his collapsing campaign for the Republican presidential nomination with a scheme to follow the traditional Labor Day pivot point of the electoral schedule with a new push to position the Wisconsin governor as the most ardently anti-union presidential candidate since Robert “Taft-Hartley” Taft mounted his failing bid for the Republican nomination in 1952.  In fairness to Taft, the late Ohio senator was never so unsympathetic to working Americans as Walker. But he had attached his name to a legislative assault on the internationally respected right to organize unions and to collectively bargain—an initiative that invited Southern segregationists to enact so-called “right to work” laws that dramatically undermined the Congress of Industrial Organizations’ “Operation Dixie” and related efforts to develop multiracial economic and social cooperation in the region.  Of course, Walker will not run as well as Taft did in his failed-but-credible attempt to wrestle the 1952 nomination from Dwight Eisenhower—a mainstream Republican who, as president, would renew the party’s historic commitment to respect, and in many instances, aid unions.  Walker’s campaign is in crisis. At the start of August, he was widely considered to be one of the top three contenders for the Republican nomination. His poll standing was such that Fox News positioned him next to emerging front-runner Donald Trump on the stage at the first debate. But Walker’s performance in that debate was dismal. His answers were vapid, and inquiries from the Fox hosts about his ever-changing positions and empty promises embarrassed a candidate who has always relied on Midwest-nice media to let him avoid questions about his competence.  As a result, Walker’s poll numbers quickly plummeted nationally and in the first-primary state of New Hampshire. More recently, he has tanked in the essential first-caucus state of Iowa.  Walker’s circumstance is so dismal that pre–Labor Day polls had him falling to eighth place in the national competition, with just 3 percent support. He is now perilously close to dropping below the line of qualification for first-tier in the upcoming debates. If that happens, Walker could find himself debating Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal rather than Donald Trump and Jeb Bush.  DC-insider Politico’s website convened a panel of analysts to assess how the last few months had gone for the presidential contenders. The consensus was that, among the Republicans, Walker was “the biggest loser of the summer.” Noting the ridiculous title of Walker’s ghost-written campaign book, one political seer concluded that “‘Unintimidated’ has given way to ‘uninformed’ and ‘unprepared.’”  True enough.  But Walker always has a plan for when he is cornered: attack workers and their unions.  This is the career politician’s default position. He has gone to it as a legislator, a county executive, and a governor.  It has never worked fiscally or economically. Wisconsin’s finances are, as Trump notes, a mess. And the state’s job-creation record is dismal—so bad that Walker was asked about it in the Fox debate as a part of a question regarding his failure to keep campaign promises.  But Walker and his allies still imagine the union-bashing gambit will work with low-information voters in early-caucus and -primary states. So the governor—who famously suggested that cracking down on teachers and nurses and other union members who questioned his policies in Wisconsin had prepared him to confront the most difficult global threats—is ramping up the anti-union rhetoric. And the Super PAC that backs his candidacy, “Unintimidated PAC,” announced on the cusp of Labor Day weekend that it had reserved $16 million in ad time in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina for a blitz that will begin with attacks on the movements of organized workers that were once hailed by Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan.  The Unintimidated PAC ad’s script maintains a favorite Walker fantasy: that when he used a so-called “budget repair bill” to attack the collective bargaining rights of public-sector workers he was taking on “the big-government union bosses.” THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!  But the images in the ad provide a reminder that this is a lie.  They show the crowds of teachers and nurses and librarians and police officers and firefighters and snowplow drivers who came to the state capitol in the deep winter of 2011 to assemble and petition for the redress of grievances. Law-enforcement officials hailed the demonstrations as well-organized and peaceful, while expressing concern about the governor’s bombastic and threatening statements—especially in a phone conversation with a caller Walker thought was one of the billionaire Koch brothers.  Walker got a pass from much of the media in 2011 and 2012, when he used tens of millions of dollars from out-of-state billionaires to finance a campaign against the protests and a recall initiative that was placed on the ballot with the petition signatures of close to a million Wisconsinites.  Now, as part of their post–Labor Day pivot, Walker and his allies will mount another free-spending campaign of distortion and division that proposes a bizarro-world “populism” in which an ally of billionaires who attacks the interests of working people is portrayed as a “fighter” who takes on special interests and “never backs down.”  The problem, of course, is that Walker’s agenda, which was always based on economic fabulism, has been revealed as political fantasy as well. He has no story to tell from Wisconsin. His “reforms” did not work. His approval rating has fallen to 39 percent in statewide surveys, and 75 percent of Wisconsin Republicans say tell pollsters they are not backing Walker for their party’s 2016 nomination.  And the Republicans who plan to attend caucuses and vote in primaries do not appear to be any more interested in Walker’s anti-union bombast than they are in Lindsey Graham’s saber-rattling for another war in the Middle East.  The point, of course, is not that Republicans have become pro-labor. Most of the candidates for the party’s nomination are supporters of so-called “right to work” initiatives, as well as privatization schemes and assaults on the interests of teachers and other public employees. Most of them support so-called “free-trade” initiatives that threaten the livelihoods of private-sector workers. (Only former governor Mike Huckabee has met with major union leaders seeking support.)  The point is that Walker cannot produce evidence that his “unintimidated’ assault on workers and their unions has yielded meaningful fiscal or economic progress.  Attacking unions never yields the benefits that the attackers claim are just around the corner. That’s because the first Republican president was right when he told Congress that “Labor is prior to and independent of capital.”  Some truths are self-evident. And Abraham Lincoln stated one of them: “Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.”"

politifact11773,1,Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom,"Sponsored Links  Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”  Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.  He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that."
pheme_239,1,The Image That Everyone Is Sharing By 'Banksy' Isn't By Banksy — But It's Awesome,"Update: The artist who made the work is @LucilleClerc    There's an illustration being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today.  While the image does have a touching message, it's a fake - not created by Banksy.  Here's the illustration that everyone is sharing:  Instagram/Banksy  Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a ""popular 'Banksy' account"" on Instagram. The instagram.com/banksy Instagram isn't run by Banksy at all, and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists - rarely with any attribution.  Banksy has issued a statement to the Independent denying that the illustration is his work. ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy,"" said a spokesman for the anonymous artist.  Instead, it appears that the illustration was originally posted by graphic designer Lucille Clerc, just with an added Instagram filter.  Here's Clerc's original Instagram post:  Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencil A photo posted by Lucille Clerc (@lucille_clerc) on Jan 1, 2015 at 2:12pm PST  Search on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you'll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages. The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts. He does, however, have one Instagram account, which was used during his recent trip to New York.  Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it.  The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles. As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts, the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity.  Here's an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account:  Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.  It's tricky to verify new Banksy work. Because of Banksy's continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy. A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are, however, experts in his work, meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy.  Nevertheless, given today's tragic events, the sentiment is strong."
E273,1,One third of vegetarians eat meat when they get drunk,"After one too many cocktails, people have been know to let their personal morals slip.  But according to a new study, a sizeable number of vegetarians commit the ultimate dietary sin when they get drunk: they eat meat.  U.K.-based discount code website VoucherCodesPro conducted a poll with 1,789 Brits who claim to be vegetarians and found that 37 percent of all respondents admitted to eating meat after they’ve had too much to drink.  The majority of respondents (63 percent) said they stood by their personal dietary codes no matter how much they drink. But the majority of those polled who admit they've fallen of the vegetarian wagon while imbibing say it happens a lot.  When asked how often they eat meat:  --34% said every time they get drunk on a night out  --26% replied fairly often  --22% said “Rarely”  --18% said “Occasionally”  The most popular meat consumed by drunk vegetarians was kebab meat. In the U.K, Middle Eastern kebab shops are as ubiquitous as New York City pizza places and offer a wide variety of options from skewers to wraps and platters. Beef burgers were the second most popular drunk snack, followed by bacon, fried chicken, and pork sausages. Vegetarians reported that they spent an average of about $7.40 a sitting on their meaty midnight meals.  But when it came to disclosing their dirty dietary secret, a majority of meat eating vegetarian respondents (69 percent) said they never told others they ate meat.  Lest you think only British vegetarians are guilty of being two faced, a 2014 study conducted by the Humane Research Council found that 84 percent of American vegetarians will eventually start consuming meat again at some point in their lives."
E562,1,Alabama Man Caught Having Sex With Pig In WalMart Bathroom,"Alabama Man Caught Having Sex With Pig In WalMart Bathroom  Alabama Man Caught Having Sex With Pig In WalMart Bathroom – News 8 – Marvin Halbert of Birmingham, Alabama is in police custody after Walmart workers found him having “inappropriate relations” with a farm pig in the superstore restroom. Customers reported hearing loud squealing coming from the bathroom in the back area of the store near the layaway department. An eyewitness said her seven-year-old son went in to use the restroom, and came out screaming, “Mommy, mommy is a man in the bathroom holding a pig really close to him!”  Confused, the woman alerted a store clerk and was informed they already had several complaints about noise in the restroom. Raymond Cooper, an employee at the Walmart store, said he was the one that ran in and saved the pig. “When I went into the bathroom, I heard squealing from inside the stall. I told the man to open it but he wouldn’t, so I kicked it in. That crazy ass fool for real was doing a pig. I socked him in the face and grabbed the pig. That fool was out cold.”  Shortly after, the police arrived and took Halbert into custody. According to reports, Halbert just cried saying, “I want my piggy back.” He later told police he had nowhere else to take his pig for alone time. His wife had just kicked them out of the house once she found out this longtime pet was her husband’s “new lover.” Halbert was seen on surveillance camera sneaking into Walmart’s loading dock and slipping undetected into the restroom.  Alabama Man Caught Having Sex With Pig In WalMart Bathroom  Halbert is currently being charged with indecent exposure and cruelty to animals. They tried to release the pig to his wife Patty, but she refused. The pig, which Halbert called “SnugUm’s” has been placed with the Humane Society for adoption."

pheme_231,1,Prince a no show in T.O.,"TORONTO  Live Nation apologized to both Prince and his Toronto fans late Tuesday night after hundreds of hopeful concertgoers spent the day waiting in a long line outside Massey Hall when rumours surfaced he was going to perform a surprise show at the historic Toronto venue.  In a Facebook posting tweeted out seven hours after Live Nation confirmed there would be no show Tuesday night, the concert promoter said it wanted to “apologize for any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier (Tuesday). The only reservation was for a production rehearsal. There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday).”  Shortly after the Live Nation tweet/Facebook posting, a spokesperson for Prince’s all-female band, 3rdEyeGirl, also sent a statement to media clarifying their “technical crew is set-up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances.  “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance (Tuesday night)... We love and thank our fans in Toronto. To all those who lined up and travelled into the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  Rumours ran rife Tuesday morning that Prince, who just put in a killer Saturday Night Live appearance over the weekend, would play a surprise show with 3rdEyeGirl, featuring Toronto guitarist Donna Grantis.  The rumours got started earlier in the day when the band itself tweeted out via @3RDEYEGIRL: “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING...” (that’s Toronto backwards).  The tweet was later deleted.​"
E389,1,"The ‘No More Tears’ Shampoo, Now With No Formaldehyde","Cathy Salerno, the vice president of research and development for the company’s consumer products division in North America, said she had seen consumer attitudes change significantly over the last decade.  When Johnson & Johnson acquired Aveeno, the natural skin care company, in 1999, it polled customers about their interest in the brand’s ingredients. The answer demonstrated little consumer concern about the details — customers wanted the company to keep it simple. “They’re telling us the opposite now,” she said.  Other manufacturers are also responding to these concerns. This fall, Walmart announced that it would eventually require suppliers to reduce or eliminate 10 chemicals from cleaning and personal care products.  Target has said it would monitor suppliers’ use of potentially harmful chemicals, then give incentives to companies that use safer chemicals. Procter & Gamble has promised to eliminate phthalates and triclosan, whose safety has also been questioned, by the end of this year.  Environmental groups disagree with the safety claims that Johnson & Johnson makes about the chemicals it is removing, and say they wish the company would be more forthright about the hazards. Nevertheless, they praised the company for keeping its commitment.  “A lot of companies say they’re going to do something, but in this case Johnson & Johnson actually did what they were going to do,” said Janet Nudelman, director of program and policy at the Breast Cancer Fund and the co-founder of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, which pushed Johnson & Johnson on the chemicals."

Unconfirmed chatter on social media indicated that wrist bands were supposed to be handed out starting at 6 p.m.  A page on Ticketmaster’s website stated that Prince would be at Massey Hall on Tuesday, with tickets being “no longer on sale.”  Also, 3rdeyegirl tweeted a hint on Monday night but deleted the tweet on Tuesday morning.

It was kind of a cryptic message, that they were on their way to Toronto and that’s enough to know that they’re playing,” Scott explained.  A lot of people in line said that they should have been at work.  “My boss let me go early. He told me that I looked sick, and he told me this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and here I am in line,” another fan named Mia said.  Extra security guards had also been posted up and down the line.  Normally, the box office opens at noon on the day of concert events, but that did not happen.  Massey Hall would not confirm anything when CityNews called on Tuesday morning.  Prince last performed in Toronto in 2011."
pheme_19,1,"German Airbus crashes in French Alps with 150 dead, black box found","SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa’s Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren.  Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board.  One of the plane’s black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France’s interior minister said.  In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation.  Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines.  “We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,” Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter.  Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain’s deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard.  Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said.  Barcelona’s Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner’s Siegfried at the theater.  French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms.  Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. “We are still searching. It’s unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,” regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters.  In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: “A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.”  It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets.  It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday’s crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December.  SHARP DESCENT  Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.  “The aircraft’s contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,” Germanwings’ Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday.  Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.  France’s DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.  “The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft’s descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,” a DGAC spokesman said.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground.  The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby.  STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD  As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in.  “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters.  Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a “dark day for Lufthansa”.  “My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,” Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there.  Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff.  In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. “The families knew each other,” he told Reuters. “The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.”  King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened.  In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the “awful tragedy”.  Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France’s Safran."

E160,1,Christian group slams Starbucks holiday cup as ‘war on Christmas’,"A group of Christian evangelists gripes that Starbucks is waging a “war on Christmas” by removing holiday images from its seasonal cup design.  Instead of the usual array of decorative images such as Christmas trees and snowflakes that have adorned the coffee cups in holidays past, the corporation has chosen to take a more minimal approach and made the cups a simple red with their green and white logo.  “Starbucks REMOVED CHRISTMAS from their cups because they hate Jesus,” said Joshua Feuerstein in a viral Facebook post that garnered nearly 10.5 million views since Thursday.  He urged Christians to voice their distaste with the company through social media with the hashtag #MerryChristmasStarbucks. Photos of the bare red cups with the handwritten message “Merry Christmas” soon started popping up all over social media, and more religious leaders began venting their frustrations with the franchise.  “I’m officially banning Starbucks from my life,” wrote student pastor Nate Weaver from Crosspointe Christian Church in Sarasota, Fla., in a Facebook post Saturday.  The Seattle-based beverage company first began implementing holiday designs in 1997, donning a “jazzy Santa” on the cups exterior, according to a Starbucks statement.  However, this year the company wanted to try out a more inclusive design.  “This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories,” said Starbucks’ Vice President of Design & Content Jeffrey Fields.  “We’re embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it.”"
politifact13557,1,Pro-Lifers Declare “Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life”,"The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.  “Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”  Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women."

E615,1,Fried food on the outs in changes for Navy chow halls,"JOINT EXPEDITIONARY BASE LITTLE CREEK-FORT STORY, Va. — Fried food is out and nutritional nagging is in as part of the big changes coming to your chow hall.  Menus will not see significant changes — not yet, at least. But you can say goodbye to the fried foods you have come to know and love; breaded chicken, French fries, and the like will be baked in state-of-the-art ovens rather than deep fried. Whole milk will be replaced by skim and soy; fruits and vegetables will be on prominent display. The fast line will remain, but its offerings will be cut back.  And this is just the beginning.  Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced a host of sweeping changes in May that will affect everything from promotions and training to uniforms and fitness. As part of that, he has set his sights on a well-balanced diet, which he calls ""the foundation of a healthy lifestyle"" that will provide capable warfighters and lower medical costs.  Mabus touted the SEALs' ""Fuel to Fight"" program as an example. It increases the availability of lean-proteins, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates to fuel, rather than feed, the warfighter. Other galleys here have implemented ""Go for Green,"" a Department of Defense nutrition program that teaches sailors to recognize and select healthier foods.  As leadership looks to boost sailors' nutrition to new levels , the recipe will mix these programs and add new ingredients. Mabus promised to ""further develop the concept at one sea-based and one shore-based unit next year, and implement it fleet-wide in 2017.""  In the meantime, ""Go for Green"" (which started as an education program) will become the standard as galleys ashore and afloat prepare for change.  That's fine with Electrician's Mate 1st Class (SW) Roberto Rodriguez. The Little Creek-Fort Story galley here is the first in his 12-year career that has offered the program. Though he admits to hitting the fast line every now and then, he typically sticks with the appropriate portions of greens and yellows. He said he's lost 10 pounds in the past two months and feels ""a whole lot better.""  × Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Navy Times Daily News Roundup to receive the top Navy stories every afternoon. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Navy Times Daily News Roundup.  'A good start'  The galley here provides a glimpse of the way ahead. Calorie count cards are posted in the chow line. Each food is labeled with green, yellow, or red tags. Utensils used by the servers and on the salad bar ensure exact portion sizes. The salad bar lacks high-calorie options like pepperoni and creamy dressings, but has plenty of sunflower seeds and cranberries. And while a foot-long chili cheese dog could be seen on a couple of tables, baked fish was the unmistakable catch of the day.  The changes — and response to those changes — are not lost on Chief Warrant Officer 3 Jeffrey Walker, who serves as the base's food service officer.  ""If the food is prepared right, sailors will accept the change over time,"" he said. And he should know. His previous command won the Ney Award for food service excellence before his departure, and this galley got a Ney nod after he arrived here.  The focus was on food cost rather than content when he became a culinary specialist 22 years ago. Everything was made from scratch. Burgers were so fatty that they shrunk to half their size when cooked. Each ship and command had flexibility to create a menu tailored to its crew. And there were plenty of fried foods, breads, and pastas.  Now, Walker pays little mind to the unused deep fat fryers as he shows off his new Rational ovens. These cook everything from scrambled eggs to Beijing duck with the touch of a few buttons — and no cooking oil. Cleaning no longer involves hours of scrubbing in strong fumes. Most bases and many ships have made the switch — but not all sailors are sold.  When Navy Times visited the Gerald R. Ford's pre-commissioning crew earlier this year, it was evident many were not thrilled the new carrier class lacks one old school technology: deep fat fryers. Sailors aboard the carrier Abraham Lincoln were thrilled to keep their fryer during refueling and complex overhaul. Other ships have had to surrender their fryers.  ""Certain foods, you can't get the flavor and texture you can get from the fryer, and when you're deployed that's one thing you have to look forward to,"" said Culinary Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Adrian Watson. He previously served on the cruiser Leyte Gulf, which had removed its fryers. ""When we got on the barge [which had fryers], that was a happy crew.""  Others said they are fine with, and even welcome the healthier preparation, but are not satisfied with the variety. Culinary Specialist 3rd Class (SW) Stephanie Ramirez-Abad would like more vegetables for the morning omelet. Seaman Musician Daniel Arute comes to the galley for the healthy choices, but would like to see more from the green category, and something other than chicken and fish.  ""The Navy is always changing, and this was a good change for me,"" Rodriguez said. ""This is a good start, but not a good finish. I hope they keep it moving forward.""  Going green  The ""Go for Green"" program operates like a stop light.  Green represents ""premium fuel,"" defined as whole foods and beverages that are the least processed, low in calories, nutrient dense, and aid in muscle recovery and development. This includes fresh vegetables and fruit, leafy green salads, brown or wild rice, oats, quinoa, baked sweet potato fries, whole-grain pasta, nuts, fish, and chicken or turkey breast without the skin. Green-labeled items should comprise at least half of each meal, according to program guidelines.  Yellow represents food and drink with some processing as well as healthy and unhealthy nutrients. These are higher in calories, and lower in vitamins and minerals. This includes salads made with iceberg lettuce, fruit with added sugar or syrups, dried fruit, white rice, pasta, baked French fries, pretzels, baked chips, crackers, whole eggs, chicken or turkey breast with the skin, ham, roast beef, processed deli meats, flavored yogurt, reduced-fat cheese, sports drinks and 2-percent milk. Sailors are advised to carefully choose small portions not to exceed one-third of their plates."

This plane was making the trip between Barcelona and Duesseldorf. There were 148 persons on board. The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think there are no survivors. I want to first express to the families that are affected by this tragic event that happened in France, our complete solidarity, as we do not yet know the identity of the victims. I immediately contacted the Prime Minister, the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is going immediately to the scene. A crisis committee has just been assembled and we will make available all the information we have in a few minutes. Before then, we will do everything so that there will be no consequences of the accident and I will have meetings, with Chancellor Merkel because there is also probably a good number of German victims and of course with the King of Spain who is visiting us today. It’s a tragedy, a new aerial tragedy, we will also know all the details and the causes of what has happened and we will evidently give them to the authorities concerned, including Spanish and German, and to the families of the victims. This is a mourning period that we need to overcome because it’s a tragedy that has occurred on our land. And finally, I have the will to know if there were not any other consequences of the accident. It happened in a region that is fairly difficult to access, I don’t know if there are any homes involved, we will know it in the coming hours. While we wait, it is solidarity that we should feel in the first place.” SOUNDBITE (German) Angela Merkel, German Chancellor: “The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock which has plunged us in Germany, and the French and the Spanish in deep sorrow. As yet we have little information about the scant details of the flight and any speculation about the crash must be ruled out. All of it will be thoroughly investigated. First of all, now, I want to focus on the amount of suffering that this disaster has brought to so many people. My thoughts and my sympathies - and also those of the entire government - are with those people who so suddenly lost their lives, among them many compatriots. The suffering for their families is immeasurable. We will do everything to make sure they get the help and assistance that can be made available in hours like these. In the past hours, I have spoken on the telephone to the French President, Francois Hollande, and also with the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy. We agreed that our nations will help each other in any way possible, to discover the cause of this catastrophe and to support the forces at the crash site and also at the airports. The Foreign Ministry has set up a crisis team that will coordinate all efforts. And Foreign Minister (Frank-Walter) Steinmeier and Transport Minister (Alexander) Dobrindt will travel to the region this afternoon. I will travel there tomorrow, to get a first-hand impression, and to talk to the local authorities, and the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hannelore Kraft, will accompany me. But in conclusion, let me say once more: in this hour in which we are all in deep sorrow.” VITORIA, SPAIN (MARCH 24. 2015) (SPANISH GOVERNMENT TV - ACCESS ALL) 1.

E491,1,Donald Trump proclaims he'll name U.S.-Mexico border barrier after himself,"Donald Trump is not backing down from his border issue stance after several of his opponents suggested a 2,000-mile barrier might be unrealistic  'We'll have a great wall,' the Republican frontrunner said on FOX Business' Mornings with Maria on Thursday. 'We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump.'  While the Donald has made no secret of his dislike for China, he says if they could do it in 200 B.C., we can do it now.  'We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump': Donald Trump is not backing down from his border issue stance after several of his opponents suggested a 2,000-mile barrier might be unrealistic  'Look at the Great Wall of China that was built 2,500 years ago. It's 13,000 miles. And we're really talking about something more than a little more than 1,000 miles,' he said.  Despite what some of his opponents claim, Trump says it can and will be done if he's elected president.  We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump Donald Trump on his border wall plan  'It can be a good-looking wall, as walls go, but we will have a really terrific wall and it will be gone for the right price,' he said. 'As you know, I know how to build. I know how to get it done.'  When host Maria Bartiromo asked about the northern border, Trump assured her the border with with Canada is a whole different ball of wax.  'It's a much different kind of situation we have with Canada,' he said.  As has been the case since the start of the real estate mogul's campaign, it's the Mexicans with whom Trump has an ax to grind and says the current string of walls at the border is not nearly enough.  'It's done poorly by the way, what they have done is very poor, very poor work, a very poor job, and very -- not much of a wall,' he said  'It's done poorly by the way, what they have done is very poor, very poor work, a very poor job, and very -- not much of a wall,' he said.  Asked at the Iowa State Fair on Monday if he supports building a wall along the U.S. Mexican border, as Trump has proposed, Wisconsin Gov. Walker gave a quick 'yes,' but he declined to address whether he supports deporting children of parents in the country illegally. 'Going forward, the best thing we can do is enforce the law,' he said.  Walker, who reversed his position in April on allowing a chance for legal status for those in the country illegally, also gave mixed answers on ending birthright citizenship.  Christie said during a CNN interview that a wall or fence along parts of the border, especially in more urban and difficult-to-control areas, was conceivable, but 'not the entire border. Doesn't make any sense.' Likewise, the New Jersey governor is opposed to requiring Mexico to pay for the construction, saying Trump's suggestion 'makes no sense.'  'And this is not negotiation of a real estate deal, OK. This is international diplomacy and it's different,' Christie said, noting Trump's line of business. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina called Trump's wall plan, 'completely unrealistic.'  Trump greets his fans at the Iowa State Fair, where some of his opponents called plans to build a wall across the 2,000 border 'unrealistic' including Carly Fiorina  Unrealistic? Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina called Trump's wall plan, 'completely unrealistic'  Trump wasn't flinching Monday.  'The wall will work,' he said when he arrived for jury duty in New York and a passer-by at the courthouse asked about the idea. He spent much of the day like other prospective jurors, filling out forms and waiting to see if he would be picked. In the end, he wasn't.  Like Trump's early derogatory campaign statements about immigrants, his new plan has lit up angry conservatives. But it also has annoyed Republicans who see the nation's growing Latino population as an opportunity to demonstrate sensitivity to minorities who have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in recent presidential elections.  Tea party movement co-founder Mark Meckler said Trump's 'position on deportation generally reflects what likely voters think. Trump is dealing head-on with the difficult issues while more establishment candidates fret over focus groups and polls.'"
E731,1,Did a Couple Kill a Dolphin by Urinating on It?,"Photographs depict a couple posing with a dolphin that died because the woman urinated in its blowhole.  On 6 June 2015, a Facebook user published a set of photographs showing an unidentified man and woman posing with a juvenile dolphin. According to the caption accompanying those images, the creature died shortly after the photograpgs were taken because (among other things) the woman had urinated in its blowhole:  This bitch killed this bottlenose dolphin by urinating in its blow hole! Hope a cell is waiting for her.  The image set was not new to the Internet (although the claim of death-by-blowhole-urination was a recently added element): social media users first learned of these photographs as early as 7 March 2014, when they were uploaded to Reddit’s WTF subreddit. At that time, the dolphin’s death was attributed solely to the couple’s playing with the marine creature on shore rather than returning it to the water, and none of the discussion claimed that the dolphin’s purported death was a result of the woman shown in the photographs (or anyone else) having urinated on it:  Guy and Girl find dolphin on shore, they decide to take silly pictures with it instead of letting it back into ocean. Dolphin dies shortly after.  The Reddit thread in question received hundreds of comments when it was active, but contributors provided little hard information about the origin of the pictures. A few users shared links to news stories, one of which was published by a Peruvian website on 5 March 2014, but that report provided little background and was largely speculative in tone:  Photographs of a couple posing next to a small dolphin have caused outrage. In the images two young people, identified as Judith and Dick, are seen holding the dolphin, lifting its tail, and even sitting astride it. Although the location of the beach or the exact date on which the pictures were recorded has not yet identified, it was learned that after this abuse the dolphin died. Other commenters say the dolphin was already dead.  The photograph reemerged on Facebook on 16 May 2015, followed several days later by a news article that identified the individuals depicted as “tourists” but provided no new information about the story behind the images.  Though the photographs (and their attendant appeal to identify the youths involved) have proved cyclically popular on social media cites, what came to be called the “Lima dolphin incident” was largely resolved by 8 March 2014, when a news site in Peru located and spoke to the individuals depicted (identified as Judith Uriol Maribel Silva and Jonathan Ramos Torres) about the incident. According to Uriol Silva and Ramos Torres, the dolphin was already dead at the time the photographs were taken:  Judith Uriol Maribel Silva, the woman who was photographed with his lover loading and sitting atop a dolphin apologized to the country. Speaking to ATV channel, Uriol Silva apologized for what [they] did with [friend] Jonathan Ramos Torres. “I made ​​a mistake in publishing this. If anything I have [done has] offended anyone, I apologize,” he said. The woman said that they found the dolphin dead in January at San Pedro beach in Chiclayo. “The animal was in shallow water, not moving. We carried it to the beach and took photos. That day there were many dead dolphins on the beach,” she said.  That statement is consistent with documented incidence of dolphin deaths in Peru that took place in early 2014. Immediately prior to the first online appearance of these photographs, the BBC had reported upon a rash of dolphin deaths in Chiclayo: precisely where the images were said to have originated:  Residents of Chiclayo, on the northern coast of Peru, have found hundreds of dead dolphins over an area 66 miles long in the last week. The region known as Lambayeque is located nearly 500 miles north of Lima, the Peruvian capital. The authorities are still investigating the cause of the deaths and have not yet ruled out the possibility of hunting killings.  Additional reports of dolphin deaths in Peru were published in January and February of 2014, the time period during which Uriol Silva said the controversial photographs were taken.  On 16 February 2016, news reports from Argentina showed a group of people on a Buenos Aires beach handling a baby dolphin and passing it around for photographs:  Argentina news outlet La Nación (and other news outlets) cited a report from Vida Silvestre, a conservation group, stating that the animal (a rare Franciscana, also known as a La Plata dolphin) died of dehydration not long afterward."
E92,1,"Ted Cruz's bizarre, flimsy description of the alleged Planned Parenthood shooter","Ted Cruz has a … unique view of the man who allegedly attacked a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week. On Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate said that instead of focusing on the suspected shooter's pro-life beliefs, the media should perhaps acknowledge that the suspect was ""a transgendered leftist activist.""  ""The media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life movement when at this point there's very little evidence to suggest that,"" Cruz said. ""It's also reported that he was registered as independent and as a woman and a transgendered leftist activist — if that's what he is.""  But being identified as a different gender on a voter registration database — in this case, something that was apparently caused by a clerical error — does not make someone transgender (or ""transgendered,"" which is the wrong term), and there's no other indication that the alleged shooter is trans. Instead, being trans is part of a deeply held identity, one that goes back to a young age for many trans people. And it has nothing to do with a person's willingness to shoot others.  What does it actually mean to be transgender?  Some people don't identify their gender as the sex they were assigned at birth. Some people, for example, may have been born with a penis, and designated male at birth as a result, but later realize that they identify as women and typical social standards of masculinity or femininity don't apply to them. These people are adopting forms of gender identity and expression that aren't related to their body parts or what sex a doctor decided they are at birth.  And to understand what transgender means, you have to understand what gender identity and expression are, and how both concepts differ.  Gender identity is someone's personal identification as man, a woman, or a gender outside of societal norms. Gender expression refers to characteristics and behaviors a person identifies with that can be viewed as masculine, feminine, a mix of both, or neither.  The vast majority of Americans are cisgender, meaning they identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. Perhaps because of this — and because people who are not cisgender have been visible in the mainstream media only relatively recently — there's an exposure gap for many Americans: For them, it can be difficult to understand how, for instance, a person born with a vagina and raised as a woman might identify as a man.  Related 9 questions about gender identity and being transgender you were too embarrassed to ask  Lily Carollo, a trans blogger in North Carolina, said she helps cisgender people expand their views on gender identity through a thought exercise that, if successful, conveys the feeling of being identified by others as the wrong gender. She begins by asking people if a huge sum of money would get them to physically transition to the opposite gender. Most people say no, she said, because they'd rather continue presenting themselves as the gender they were born as and identify with. ""If you go into why they're answering no, they'll usually say that it wouldn't feel right,"" Carollo said. ""That's what you lock into. Take that sense and imagine if you had been born in the opposite body.""  A common misconception is that gender identity and expression are linked to sexual or romantic attraction. But a trans person can identify as a man, even though he was assigned female at birth, and be gay (attracted to other men), straight (attracted to women), bisexual, asexual (sexually attracted to no one), or attracted to a traditionally undefined gender; trans women can also be sexually attracted to men, women, both, no one, or another preference.  Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, acknowledged that this concept can be difficult to explain. ""If somebody was living as a man dating women, and now they're living as a woman dating women, what does that mean? They were straight; now they're gay,"" Keisling said. ""But did their sexual orientation change, or were they always attracted to women?""  This infographic, put together by Trans Student Educational Resources, helps break through some of that confusion by showing how a person's gender identity and expression fall outside characteristics like sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth:  The idea behind these different forms of identity and expression is that traditional gender roles — how people are expected by society to act based on the gender assigned to them at birth — are a social construct, not a biological one. This is a concept that causes a great deal of debate in religious and conservative circles, but it's largely uncontroversial for many anthropologists who indicate that gender is flexible enough that different societies and people can construct and interpret it differently.  So transgender is a term used to describe someone's deeply held gender identity and how it differs from societal standards and expectations. It's not something, as Cruz's comments suggest, that someone declares as a whim right before voting.  If the suspected shooter is trans, then, it would very likely show up in far more aspects of his life, not just a one-off mention in a voter registration database that turned out to be no more than an error."
E490,1,Was Amelia Bassano the Real William Shakespeare?,"In August 2015, a meme claiming that a black woman named Amelia Bassano Lanyer was the true (uncredited) author of all of William Shakespeare’s plays began circulating online:  Although the authorship of Shakespeare’s plays remains a topic of some debate among scholars, the above-displayed meme contains several factual errors.  First, Aemilia Bassano (later Emilia Lanier) was indeed a published author, not someone whose work was suppressed because of her race or gender. In fact, the Shakespearean Authorship Trust notes that Bassano became the “first woman to publish a book of original poetry” when her work Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was put into print in 1611:  Brought up opposite the theatre district in a family of Venetian Jews of Moroccan ancestry, at the age of 7 she was given to be educated by Countess Susan Bertie, in the family headed by Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby. At the age of 13 she became mistress to Lord Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theatre. When she got pregnant a decade later she was expelled from court and married off to a minstrel. She was one of the first women to own and operate a school and the first woman to publish a book of original poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611). She died in poverty.  Second, Bassano was not black. She was born to Baptista Bassano (a Venice musician at the court of Elizabeth I) and Margaret Johnson in 1569, and biographies of her note that she “was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.”  No contemporaneous accounts describe Bassano as “black” (or “African”), and although its provenance is uncertain, many historians believe that this miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Amelia Bassano:  Amelia Bassano may have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano’s relatives were referred to as “black” when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions:  Brought to London from Venice in 1538/9, the dark-skinned Bassanos, some of whom were described in contemporary records as ‘black’ and who may have been of Moroccan as well as Jewish ancestry, became established as the Court recorder troupe.”  Lastly, the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare’s plays is a decidedly fringe notion, even within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies. While she is listed as a potential candidate by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust (a group seemingly determined to credit Shakespeare’s work to anyone but Shakespeare himself), even among that group she is included as just one of 66 candidates identified so far:"
E608,1,West Point Revokes Diplomas Of Confederate Graduates,"WEST POINT, N.Y. ─ Following the decision of the South Carolina government to remove the Confederate flag from a state memorial, and the subsequent, nation-wide uproar over all things Confederate, West Point has announced that it will posthumously revoke the diplomas of all cadets who graduated from the Academy and fought for the South during the Civil War.  “This sends a clear message to slave-owners and those who would fight for such a horrific cause that 150 years after most of them died we will not tolerate such atrocities on American soil,” said Lt. Col. Thomas Jackson, a spokesman for the school.  When asked if this decision signaled a change in the Army’s stance on not changing the names of bases named after Confederate officers, most of whom graduated from West Point, Jackson replied that it did not. The cost of altering the signs, street names, maps, military shipping inventories, and other changes necessary to implement the removal just so people wouldn’t be offended would be astronomical, he explained.  “But this is no small matter,” he added. “A revoked graduate status means they will no longer be able to order transcripts, obtain early tickets for West Point football games, or receive their 10 percent discount at the Cadet Bookstore.”  The ceremony will be held next week, when cadets will symbolically burn hundreds of recreated, historically accurate diplomas in a bonfire at the cadet monument. After the diplomas are consumed in the blaze, the monument will be torn down, since it was built to honor Vincent Lowe, a cadet who died in an 1817 artillery misfire and had an uncle who once owned a slave, explained a source familiar with the event.  Jackson also said that USMA leaders are debating the merits of removing Gen. Robert E. Lee’s half of the Appomattox surrender document that ended the Civil War, currently stored in the Cadet Library."

E259,1,Storm science: Patricia's ascent from tropical storm to record hurricane,"WASHINGTON -- Hurricane Patricia zoomed from tropical storm to record-beater in 30 hours flat like a jet-fueled sports car.  Why? The Pacific storm had just the right ingredients.  Plenty of warm water provided the energy what meteorologists call explosive intensification. The air was much moister than usual, adding yet more fuel. And at the same time, upper-level crosswinds -- called shear -- that restrain a hurricane from strengthening were missing for much of Thursday, meteorologists said.  ""I was really astounded,"" said MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel. ""It was over the juiciest part of the eastern Pacific.""  El Nino's fingerprints are all over this, meteorologists agreed. And while it fits perfectly into climate scientists' theories of what a warming world will be like, they say global warming can't quite be blamed -- yet.  At 10 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Patricia was a tropical storm off Mexico with 65 mph winds that forecasters expected to intensify rapidly. In fact, one forecast gave it a 97 per cent chance of getting stronger fast.  But it strengthened so quickly that many were surprised, said Robert Rogers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division.  By 4 a.m. EDT Friday Patricia's winds were a record for hurricanes: 200 mph.  ""Incredible. You don't see many like this,"" said former hurricane hunter meteorologist Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private Weather Underground. ""In fact in the Western Hemisphere, we've never seen anything like this.""  In the Eastern Hemisphere, satellite estimates measured Typhoon Nancy at 215 mph in 1961 and Typhoon Violet at 205 mph also in 1961, but satellite measurements aren't as precise, Masters said. (Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are all the same thing with different names.)  Super Typhoon Haiyan that devastated the Philippines in 2013 was measured at 195 mph via satellite. However, most storms don't have accurate measurements because most don't get planes flown into them unless they are a threat, Emanuel said.  He's part of an experiment with the U.S. Navy, dropping measuring devices from planes into Patricia for the past three days.  Worldwide, this is the ninth Category 5 storm this year, which is tied for the second most on record, Masters said. Normal years are around five to six. A Category 5 storm has winds of 157 mph or higher.  The eastern and northern Pacific regions have had more tropical storms than usual this season; the Atlantic has had less.  That's a classic signature of the weather pattern called El Nino -- with warmer waters to feed storms and favourable winds in the Pacific and unfavourable winds in the Atlantic, Masters and others said.Seth Borenstein  Patricia is being fueled by near-record warm 87-degree Pacific waters at the surface that ran warm unusually deep.  Climate science theory says that as the world warms, the most extreme storms will get even stronger and wetter. Patricia's record strength is ""consistent with what we say"" but there are too few examples to make a scientifically accurate connection, Emanuel said.  Patricia and Haiyan from 2013 may be ""warning signs that, hey this could be the future,"" Masters said.  AP videojournalist Tony Winton in Miami contributed to this report."
E456,1,Carson ties abortion to slavery at anti-Planned Parenthood rally,"“We have just gradually slid in terms of our morals to a point where we don’t really care about the killing of human beings. That is the bad news, the good news is I think we are changing,” Carson said. “We are capable of changing. You know there was a time in this country where there were people who thought it was OK to own other people ... We fortunately as a society matured.”  Carson made the comments at the Washington, D.C., “Women Betrayed” rally, one of dozens of events organized around the country in support of defunding Planned Parenthood, which has come under fire after an anti-abortion group released videos showing executives at the organization discussing the cost of fetal organs for donation to medical researchers. As an activist held an ""Unborn Lives Matter"" sign behind him, Carson recounted how hard he'd worked to save unborn children's lives as a former neurosurgeon.  RELATED: Hillary Clinton strongly defends Planned Parenthood  This isn't the first time Carson has tied abortion to slavery: In 2012, the retired surgeon said pro-life activists were akin to abolitionists, and in 2014 said legal abortion was akin to human sacrifice. Other controversial comparisons have made him a conservative celebrity even as he earned national notoriety, like when he called Obamacare the ""worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.”  Two other presidential candidates -- Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz – also spoke at the rally.  “Every member of the Senate and every member of the House should stand together and say under no circumstances should federal taxpayer dollars should be sent today to an ongoing basis to an ongoing criminal enterprise like Planned Parenthood,” Cruz thundered to the crowd.  “I’m calling today for Hillary Clinton to return the money she’s been receiving from Planned Parenthood officials. The time is now to take a stand!” Paul said.  All three vowed to defund Planned Parenthood if elected president."
E446,1,Donald Trump: Move the Palestinians to Puerto Rico,"NEW YORK – Billionaire Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has unveiled a controversial peace proposal for the strife-torn holy land: give the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico to the Palestinians as compensation for surrendering to Israel.  According to the so-called “Trump Solution,” rolled out by the outspoken business magnate at a Manhattan press conference, the U.S. would fund the relocation of all four or so million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Caribbean archipelago, and offer them “free housing, job training and a lifetime supply of deodorant.”  “It’s perfect. Puerto Rico is over 1,000 square miles bigger than the West Bank and Gaza, far more fertile, and the influx of millions of migrants will boost its economic recovery,” Trump explained. “I’ll even build them an exact replica of that darn mosque they’re always killing innocent Israelis over.” Unlike native Puerto Ricans, however, the so-called “Puertostinians” would not be able to relocate to the U.S. proper if they don’t like their new homeland: “We’re overrun by Mexican criminals as it is.”  Welcome to ‘Trump Gaza’  The real estate mogul then unraveled a relabeled map of Puerto Rico, pointing to where he plans to build an adults-only mega resort on the archipelago’s second largest island, to be renamed ‘Isla De Gaza.’  “There’s a fortune to be made by fulfilling people’s jihadist sex fantasies on a Disney-scale,” he said, outlining some of the main attractions of ‘Trump Gaza’: a topless ‘72 Virgins Casino,’ “Safari-style” tours to mock refugee and jihadist training camps, ‘Shoot Your Own Rocket’ and ‘Dig Your Own tunnel’ workshops, ‘Catch a Zionist’ competitions, ‘Torture a POW’ sessions, as well as underground “Abu Ghraib-themed” BDSM parties. “Let the Puertostinians both preserve and profit from their native culture,” Trump said.  While Puerto Rico’s governor slammed the ‘Trump Solution’ as racist (“we refuse to become a minority in our own land”), Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded by offering Trump some humor-laced advice: “From one old man to another, it’s time to age gracefully – all that fake tan, collagen and Viagra are rotting your brain.”  Read more about this story"

pheme_377,1,"No surprise Prince show, Live Nation says","Concert promoter Live Nation has tweeted that Prince will not be performing at Massey Hall on Tuesday night despite the day’s rumours.  People had lined up since this morning for the Prince concert.  The bearer of bad news were the security guards who removed the metal barricades and told the crowd that there’d be no concert on Tuesday night.  In response to inquiries, we can confirm that Prince will not be performing at @masseyhall tonight. — Live Nation Ontario (@LiveNationON) November 4, 2014  On Tuesday night Live Nation released the following statement on Facebook apologizing for the confusion over the concert:  Live Nation wants to apologize for any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today. The only reservation was for a production rehearsal. There was no concert scheduled for today.  Prince’s all-girl band 3rdeyegirl also released a statement Tuesday night thanking fans for their support.  “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight,” the statement read. “To all those who lined up and travelled in to the city for tickets, we hope to see you soon and are looking forward to bringing our show to Toronto in the future.”  According to the statement crews were setting-up at Massey Hall to rehearse lighting and sound for “possible future performances” but there was not a scheduled performance and “never confirmation of a show.”  Some fans think there will be a show on Wednesday night but Live Nation said that won’t happen. Fans continued to gather outside Massey Hall until 8 p.m., holding out hope.  “These are all his fans out here in this lineup in the rain and in the cold? And this is how he’s going to treat his fans?,” one fan in line said. “Never again will I purchase any of his music, never again will I go to any of his concerts.”  Sources told CityNews early on Tuesday morning that people inside the venue were told to get ready for the Purple Rain singer’s pop-up show.  Unconfirmed chatter on social media indicated that wrist bands were supposed to be handed out starting at 6 p.m.  A page on Ticketmaster’s website stated that Prince would be at Massey Hall on Tuesday, with tickets being “no longer on sale.”  Also, 3rdeyegirl tweeted a hint on Monday night but deleted the tweet on Tuesday morning. Various fan groups retweeted the band.  “@3RDEYEGIRL: 4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…” BE READY #PrinceArmy ! ! !  — PURPLESSENCE (@PURPLESSENCE) November 4, 2014  The lineup started at the venue at Shuter Street and Victoria Street, went south along Victoria Street to Queen Street and around the corner on Queen.  One Prince fan named Scott was the very first person in line at 6:30 a.m.  “I had a Twitter alert that woke me up at 4:30 a.m. from his band — 3rdeyegirl — saying that he was playing. It was kind of a cryptic message, that they were on their way to Toronto and that’s enough to know that they’re playing,” Scott explained.  A lot of people in line said that they should have been at work.  “My boss let me go early. He told me that I looked sick, and he told me this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and here I am in line,” another fan named Mia said.  Extra security guards had also been posted up and down the line.  Normally, the box office opens at noon on the day of concert events, but that did not happen.  Massey Hall would not confirm anything when CityNews called on Tuesday morning.  Prince last performed in Toronto in 2011."
E355,1,"This feminist is suing the man who saved her life, for rape","“A man saved me from drowning, but now I am suing him for rape because he touched me”.  These are the no-nonsense words of hysterically cold Cassidy Boon, a Canadian comedian who never slips up or laughs at her own jokes. Recently, Cassidy set the web on fire with a string of bizarre satirical videos and articles in which she coined the hashtag #SaveRape.  #SaveRape, or so it goes, is when a man rescues a woman from a perilous situation without asking her consent, touching her in the process, and thereby committing an act of rape. Cassidy claims to have been SaveRaped after drowning in the sea last year.  “I was disgusted at this hairy man having felt it appropriate to touch my body like that. To grab me forcefully and pull me in what ever direction HE wanted to go. He took control of my body down there in the cold water, when I was unconscious and unable to look out for myself, he touched my all-but-bikini bare body when I was KNOCKED out and unable to struggle. Him, being a white man, felt he had the right to possess my milky body – to put his rough hands on my innocent flesh and command my body to come with him to the surface. I did NOT give him consent, in fact I was UNABLE to give consent and yet he grabbed me around my waist and gripped my hand and pressed my body against his like we he wanted to engage in aquatic sex.”  Of course, Cassidy is only having a laugh. But that didn’t stop scores of radical feminists from agreeing with her on Twitter, furious that her aggressor had the audacity to touch her and pull her to safety. Many others disagreed, shaming her for unjustly accusing an innocent man.  Most people seem to have missed the point, venting their outrage much to Cassidy’s delight and dismay. Cassidy is a prankster who believes in what she calls ‘true gender equality’ and clearly doesn’t have much time for a lot of the debates currently surrounding feminist issues.  @CassidyBoon95 you are honestly a joke! you should have been left in the lake if thats how you react to being saved! — Matt Niemann (@matthew_niemann) August 23, 2015  Cassidy Boon is absolutely vile — Georgie Lane (@georgielanee) August 23, 2015  Cassidy Boon is a typical white feminist, her views are ridiculous. Stop white feminism now! — Meghan (@Meghan_Finn) August 25, 2015  #SaveRape – as far as we can tell – appears to be a parody of the much more serious ‘Rape by deception’ (also known as ‘Rape by fraud’) a crime in which the perpetrator has the victim’s sexual consent and compliance, but gains it through deception or fraudulent statements.  In 2008, a Massachusetts woman by the name of Marissa Lee-Fuentes ~unknowingly~ had sex with her boyfriend’s brother in the dark basement that she was sleeping in. He was not prosecuted because the law at that time required rape to include the use of force.  Massachusetts State House Representative Peter Koutoujian later crafted rape-by-fraud legislation in response. In future, if you seduce someone and lie to them in the process, they could claim you raped them afterwards because they slept with you under false pretences.  @CassidyBoon95 You have taken advantage of this man who saved your life while turning rape into a joke. You are Absolute scum. — Areitha Rose (@AreithaRose) August 23, 2015  this cassidy boon thing is absolutely ridiculous how was this man meant to save you in any other way than pull you up to the surface omg — niamhy (@niamhrachael) August 25, 2015  Found the biggest attention whore on the internet today. #Saverape — Cheyenne Roberts♌️ (@Cheyenne_Robe) June 26, 2015  “I am now charging or suing or whatever, this man for rape – because what he did is literally the definition of rape – he exerted his Patriarchal power over me and did stuff to my body without my consent. Sure, he saved me from drowning, but if we start excusing rape just because our rapists did a nice thing to us, we’re really just excusing rape culture. I know a lot of misogynists and anti-feminists are going to be all like “hurr durr, you should thank that man for saving you, you wouldn’t be there without him, he only touched you because he needed to save you from downing” Oh yeah and by that shoddy logic we should excuse serial killers for being nice to hitchhikers and picking them up before killing them. The truth is HE RAPED ME, HE PUT HIS HANDS ON ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT, and regardless of saving my life or not, he needs his due punishment for violating me in that disgusting way.”  Cassidy, if that’s even her real name, has single-handedly proven that the internet can’t take a joke. Let alone appreciate some quality satire. Read Cassidy’s full article here, it’s proper lolz.  I am about to drop an article that's gonna blow y'alls minds #BoonIsBest — Cassidy Boon (@CassidyBoon95) June 27, 2015  Editor’s Note: We have since caught up with Cassidy who tells us that, sadly, her stunt was inspired by a real Tumblr post.

E420,1,Michigan DNR Might Cancel Deer Hunting Season In Upper Peninsula,"ST. IGNACE (WWJ/AP) – Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources is considering, among several things, canceling the fall deer hunting season in the Upper Peninsula as a response to a smaller deer population.  Deer management specialist Chad Stewart doubts the fall season will be scratched, but he said it’s one of six options to be presented to the Natural Resources Commission at its May 7 meeting.  “That would be the most extreme, sort of a knee-jerk reaction, but yeah, that would be the most extreme action they could do,” Stewart told WWJ’s Beth Fisher. “It’s just simply one potential option that’s being brought forward.”  In December, state biologists estimated that the harvest was down as much as 40 percent across the Upper Peninsula. Some places had 40 inches of snow by mid-November, and recent winters have been extreme. Stewart said the number of deer killed in the Upper Peninsula during the 2014 season was one of the lowest in 30 years.  Terry Minzey, DNR’s Upper Peninsula Regional Supervisor, said the number of deer brought to check stations declined as much as 60 percent in some locations.  “The deer harvest that we’ve been seeing in the U.P. has been on a steady decline for a couple years now and our predictions for this coming year for the U.P. are about 20 to 30 percent lower than they were last year,” said Stewart.  [DNR: Deer Harvest Down During 2014 Firearm Season]  Closing the U.P. hunt would be a blow to tradition and culture.  Hunting gives a big lift to the economy north of the Mackinac Bridge. Some young hunters skip school on Nov. 15, opening day. A character in the 2001 comedy about Michigan hunters, “Escanaba in Da Moonlight,” says opening day is “like Christmas with guns.”  Closing the season “would be a huge impact,” St. Ignace Visitors Bureau President James Dekeyser told WPBN-WTOM. “All the people that have camps and come up and buy groceries, eating in the restaurants. … They have a lot of small communities and there’d be a lot of hurt on all those small communities.”  Other options for the DNR include restricting the killing of does and limiting hunters to just one buck. Stewart said he expects a decision by July.  “My personal hope is that they hear that option of shutting down the U.P. season and consider it for about one second and then decide that that’s not something they want to pursue,” said Stewart.

This plane was making the trip between Barcelona and Duesseldorf. There were 148 persons on board. The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think there are no survivors. I want to first express to the families that are affected by this tragic event that happened in France, our complete solidarity, as we do not yet know the identity of the victims. I immediately contacted the Prime Minister, the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is going immediately to the scene. A crisis committee has just been assembled and we will make available all the information we have in a few minutes. Before then, we will do everything so that there will be no consequences of the accident and I will have meetings, with Chancellor Merkel because there is also probably a good number of German victims and of course with the King of Spain who is visiting us today. It’s a tragedy, a new aerial tragedy, we will also know all the details and the causes of what has happened and we will evidently give them to the authorities concerned, including Spanish and German, and to the families of the victims. This is a mourning period that we need to overcome because it’s a tragedy that has occurred on our land. And finally, I have the will to know if there were not any other consequences of the accident. It happened in a region that is fairly difficult to access, I don’t know if there are any homes involved, we will know it in the coming hours. While we wait, it is solidarity that we should feel in the first place.” SOUNDBITE (German) Angela Merkel, German Chancellor: “The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock which has plunged us in Germany, and the French and the Spanish in deep sorrow. As yet we have little information about the scant details of the flight and any speculation about the crash must be ruled out. All of it will be thoroughly investigated. First of all, now, I want to focus on the amount of suffering that this disaster has brought to so many people. My thoughts and my sympathies - and also those of the entire government - are with those people who so suddenly lost their lives, among them many compatriots. The suffering for their families is immeasurable. We will do everything to make sure they get the help and assistance that can be made available in hours like these. In the past hours, I have spoken on the telephone to the French President, Francois Hollande, and also with the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy. We agreed that our nations will help each other in any way possible, to discover the cause of this catastrophe and to support the forces at the crash site and also at the airports. The Foreign Ministry has set up a crisis team that will coordinate all efforts. And Foreign Minister (Frank-Walter) Steinmeier and Transport Minister (Alexander) Dobrindt will travel to the region this afternoon. I will travel there tomorrow, to get a first-hand impression, and to talk to the local authorities, and the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hannelore Kraft, will accompany me. But in conclusion, let me say once more: in this hour in which we are all in deep sorrow.” VITORIA, SPAIN (MARCH 24. 2015) (SPANISH GOVERNMENT TV - ACCESS ALL) 1. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) SPANISH PRIME MINISTER, MARIANO RAJOY, SAYING: I have had the opportunity to speak to German Chancellor Angel Merkel and we have shared what we know about this very sad incident. I have also spoken to the King, who as you know is in France. Also I’ve spoken to the President of the Catalan regional government, Artur Mas, and to the leader of the opposition Pedro Sanchez. All that I can say at this time is that I am, like everyone, very sad to hear about this really sad and dramatic accident. We are going to do everything we can to help and support the families. We’ll give them all our support and attention. Ladies and Gentleman, I’m sure you understand that I can’t say any more than what I have said already. Thank you.”"
E293,1,Woman Arrested In Walmart For Trying On Tampons In the Feminine Care Aisle,"News 8 – A 44-year-old Arkansas woman is now behind bars after Walmart employees found her trying on tampons and sanitary pads in the feminine care aisle. Cheryl Woolery, a Springdale, Arkansas resident, was led out of the store in handcuffs after her resisting arrest turned into a bloody mess. Eyewitnesses say Woolery entered the Walmart store on Monday and approached the customer service desk for a return. Woolery complained that the Tampax ‘Lites’ were causing her to “leak” and the cardboard applicator was just too “rough” for her “woowoo” and she wanted to exchange them for something else.  “I was stocking the deodorants which is right next to the isle where the feminine hygiene products are kept,” said Rena Rice, an employee at Walmart. “When I walked past the aisle this crazy out of her mind lady was in, I couldn’t believe what I saw. I mean really, there were five used bloody tampons on the ground that she had already tried on! I caught her trying to stick a sanitary pad on her underwear. That’s when I radioed for security.”  When security confronted the woman, she turned around to leave. “When I asked her what she was doing, she turned around to take off,” head security officer Randy McWilliams said. “That’s when I grabbed her arm and pulled her towards me but I slipped on one of the bloody tampons and we both hit the ground. That was probably the most disgusting thing that’s ever happened to me.”  Police arrived on scene within minutes and took Woolery into custody. According to authorities, Woolery explained she was not going to spend another dime on a product that won’t work for her. She said she should be able to “try on tampons just like you try on clothes in the dressing room, to make sure they fit.”  Walmart released a statement saying “It is against our policy to allow customers to try on tampons in the aisles, bathrooms, or dressing rooms. Anyone attempting to will be arrested and never allowed back into our stores.” Woolery was booked on charges of shoplifting, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest. She is being held on a $500 bond."

E631,1,Gay Advocates Hurl Feces-Stained Bible Pages at Christians for Protesting Teaching of Homosexuality in German Schools,"Gay Advocates Hurl Feces-Stained Bible Pages at Christians for Protesting Teaching of Homosexuality in German Schools  Email Print Img No-img Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment  Gay advocates in Germany reportedly attacked Christian parents with ""little bags of feces"" and feces-stained pages ripped from the Bible for protesting a new government sex education program in schools that seeks to teach students about homosexuality.  A DW report explains that the protest is part of an ongoing debate over a plan in the state of Baden-Württemberg to include ""sexual diversity"" in the 2015 school curriculum. The details of that plan are still being hammered out.  A middle school teacher from the Black Forest region in southwest Germany launched a petition which branded the effort as ""an educational, moral, and ideological reeducation"" in the state's schools.  The petition argues that the educational plan fails to ""reflect the negative side effects of an LGBT lifestyle"" – citing suicide, drug misuse, HIV and mental illness.  Nearly 200,000 supporters have signed the petition and protests are ongoing against it.  The Observatory on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians recently highlighted an incident in which Christian parents protesting the plan were attacked by gay advocates.  ""Eyewitnesses told the Observatory: Christian parents were shouted at with obscenities. They were spit at, eggs were thrown and little bags with feces or color. Cables of loud speakers were torn out,"" noted the Observatory in a statement.  ""Pages were ripped out of the bible and used to wipe backsides, then formed into a ball and thrown at the parents. Christians were deeply hurt in this process. At least one banner was snatched from and destroyed in front of the eyes of the parents,"" it continued. ""Marshals were target with pepper sprays. Shouting by counter-demonstrator made the planned public speaking partly impossible.  ""Many parents reported to have been shocked at the amount of hatred and at the inactivity of the police, and that their religious feelings were severely hurt,"" it ended.  Doro Moritz, head of an educational and science union in the state of Baden-Württemberg believes that the new plan is necessary for schools in the state.  ""So far, this is a topic that can be touched upon if a teacher feels like it. But since this is a difficult topic for teachers, it hardly ever comes up,"" he said.  He added that the petition against the plan won't stop it.  ""This is a clear attempt to keep the topic of sexual diversity out of the classrooms,"" he said, arguing that the first draft of the petition branded as discriminatory tried to prey on people's fears.  ""It conveyed fears that are not backed up by the working papers at all,"" said Moritz. He also pointed out that the German Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs is firmly behind the plan and has clarified its intent.  ""Information about pluralism in life planning as well as sexual preference is supposed to strengthen the self-esteem of children and teenagers, as well as their appreciation of others, ultimately helping young adults to develop their own personalities,"" the ministry said in a statement."

""Prince will not be performing at [Massey Hall] tonight,"" the concert promoter tweeted shortly before 3 p.m., news that dampened the spirits of thousands of fans who had waited in line for hours, in the rain.  It all started early Tuesday when 3rdEyeGirl — Prince's all-female live band — tweeted this cryptic message: ""4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…"".  Donna Grantis, far left, a Toronto native very well respected throughout the city's blues and rock scenes, plays in 3rdEyeGirl, who are currently touring with Prince. (Handout/Canadian Press)  The tweet was deleted shortly after 8:30 a.m., but it sent shock waves through Toronto-area Prince fans. The veteran musician played surprise gigs in Europe earlier this year, and once called Toronto home.  Fans were convinced. But after Live Nation made its announcement, they were left wondering what had happened.  ""Maybe he's just got a flat tire somewhere, who knows?"" said one.  ""We can't really blame anybody because all of this is based on speculation,"" said another.  Band apologizes  Members of 3rdEyeGirl tweeted apologies later that evening.  ""For all those who waited in line, I apologize for any disappointment caused by the confusion,"" tweeted guitar player Donna Grantis, a well-known Toronto blues player with musical connections throughout the city.  Drummer Hannah Welton added the day's events were ""a total mix up"" and that, ""there was never a show confirmed.""  CBC News was unable to confirm what was going on, but a CBC cameraman at Massey Hall said a drum kit emblazoned with Prince's famous symbol was being set up on stage. The cameraman and a CBC reporter were then asked to leave the venue.  A news release issued by 3rdEyeGirl added that its equipment had been set up ""to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances.""  One Prince fan who heard about the show on Twitter told CBC he's waiting because he's ""loved Prince for 25 years.""  ""His career spans so many different grooves and styles. I love all of it,"" said the fan, who identified himself only as Tom.  On Saturday, Prince and 3rdEyeGirl played a much-applauded, extended seven-minute set on Saturday Night Live.

E61,1,Providing biblical counsel to sexually confused youth soon illegal in Cincy…,"If you would like to read one of the many 2-minute arguments made today in opposition to this law, mine is here. More thoughts and analysis of the meeting to come soon, Lord willing. (Spoiler: The new law was approved despite the broad opposition of almost every voter present, many of whom were pastors.)  [NOTE: The text of the law applies to “mental health professionals” while working with minors. It only applies to those pastors that are licensed. The text of my article has been slightly changed to account for that. I also changed the title of the post, because it was misleading people. That was my fault, and I apologize for it.]  At today’s meeting of the Cincinnati City Council law and public safety committee, Council Member Chris Seelbach “will propose an ordinance that would impose a $200-a-day fine on a therapist or counselor practicing the therapy that aims to “change” lesbians, gay men, bisexuals or transgender people from their sexual orientation or gender identity,” according to Cincinnati.com.  According to the article it will likely be a done deal on Wednesday of this week. Seelbach is confident that he has the necessary votes both to make it out of committee tonight and to pass it as law on Wednesday. Although a few states have passed similar laws, no major city has done so, and Cincinnati.com is exultant in claiming that Cincinnati is leading the way in such wickedness.  Why “wickedness”? Because this law is nothing less than a denial of the biblical doctrine of sanctification, threatening fines of $73,000 per year to a counselor that uses 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 to help those caught in sin: “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.” (1 Corinthians 6:9-11).  In other words, those that refuse to bow the knee to the idol of sexual anarchy being promoted across our land will be forced to pay the price.  I’ve written before about this choice that churches are going to face. Here is how I summed it up:  Every church in the country will have to decide which side we are on and our decision and witness will be made public. After a time of hemming and hawing, we’ll find we have only two options: 1. Publicly opposing homosexual identity and relations by quoting Scripture.  2. Publicly promoting homosexual identity and relations by quoting Scripture.  It looks like pastors and churches in Cincinnati will face this choice sooner rather than later. Now is a great opportunity for churches to speak up for God’s holy law and the grace he offers to sinners. This is not a political question. It is a question of whether or not we are ashamed of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Do we believe in the new birth that Christ speaks of in John 3? Do we believe in the sanctification without which no man will see God? Or do we fear man?  No more hemming and hawing. It’s time to decide now. If your church is in Cincinnati, the choice has been set before you. The Cincinnati City Council will meet this Wednesday, December 9, 2015 at 2 p.m. in Council Chambers, Room 300, City Hall, 801 Plum St, Cincinnati, OH 45202. [Please note that the time for public comment is at 1:30pm. My understanding is that each person will be given 2 minutes to speak.]  Please come and speak against this anti-Christian persecution. Please ask your church leaders to be there for the sake of Christians and for the sake of those tempted by sexual perversion in our city.  [Edited to change “pastor” to “counselor” and “church” to “people” in one place.]  [Closing comments. I think we commented this one out, people. Thanks for your contributions.]"

The Germanwings Airbus A320 disintegrated on impact at an altitude of about 6,500 feet, killing everyone aboard — including 16 high schoolers returning from a trip, two infants and a pair of renowned opera singers.  “A picture of horror,” said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier after flying over the remote crash site hours after the plane inexplicably went down.  Its crew of six, including the veteran pilot of Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, was wiped out as the plane completed its deadly descent from a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.

Germanwings flight 4U9525 crashed in the Alps near Barcelonnette, France.  The plane’s altitude plummeted steadily over an eight-minute stretch starting at 10:45 a.m., although never plunging at the rate typically associated with a catastrophic equipment failure.  The plane fell off the radar at 10:53 a.m. in the Digne region of the Alps-De-Haute Province, officials said. Germanwings is the budget airline of Lufthansa.  Routine maintenance on the 24-year-old aircraft was done just one day before the Tuesday morning tragedy, and the airline last gave its plane a thorough once-over in summer 2013.

An A320 operated by AirAsia plummeted off the coast of Borneo in December.  Ten helicopters and a military plane were dispatched to the Alps in a recovery mission that was expected to last several days. Officials said 67 German nationals were aboard the plane.  Two babies were also killed on the flight, including the child of internationally known opera singer Maria Radner. The contralto was flying back to Germany with her husband and their child; all three perished.  Radner had just finished performing the opera “Siegfield” in Barcelona with renowned baritone Oleg Bryjak — who also died in the crash.

A 34-year-old mother of 3 is now under arrest after a shoplifting incident turned tragic. Witnesses say Shatuanee Greene entered the North Carolina Walmart on Sunday with her three children ages 5, 7, and 8 when she grabbed a can of pre-made Christmas cookie dough. CCTV footage shows the young mother take the can to the toy aisle as her children crowded around her. Greene then lifted up her skirt and made the can of cookie dough “disappear.”  When Greene was approached by Walmart security, she told her children to go find their Aunt in the front of the store. “I told her to hand over the cookie dough,” said Timothy Reiner, a security guard at Walmart. “That’s when she turned around to run and I grabbed her by the arm. She put up a good fight, and that’s when I tackled her to the ground. Then I heard a loud pop and the lady started screaming. Gooey cookie dough was running down her leg. All hot and runny… it was so damn gross.”  According to eyewitnesses, the EMT that treated Greene on the scene said the Pillsbury cookie dough can exploded in Greene’s vagina during the fall causing her extreme pain. They removed the contents at the scene. The woman was treated then released into the custody of Greenville police. While stabilizing Greene they also found candy sprinkles and a number 6 birthday candle wedged into the woman’s vaginal cavity. Greene did not suffer any serious injuries and is being held at the county jail on a $2000 bond. Her children were placed with family members."

E489,1,New SeaWorld Show Just Elephant Drowning In Large Tank Of Water With No Explanation,"The Elephant Drowning show can be viewed every day at SeaWorld at 11 a.m., 1 p.m, and 3 p.m. in Shamu Stadium.  ORLANDO, FL—Noting that the show had simply appeared on the park’s schedule last week without an announcement or fanfare of any kind, visitors to SeaWorld told reporters Thursday that the theme park’s latest attraction consists solely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water with no explanation.  Advertisement  The most recent addition to the amusement park’s slate of entertainment—listed on brochures and signs simply as “Elephant Drowning”—reportedly features an adult African elephant that is led out by trainers into the main amphitheater, where it is immediately shoved into a 36-foot-deep aquarium and left to slowly die, all without the music, lighting cues, or narration that typically accompany other SeaWorld shows.  “After they pushed it into the pool, it swam around for a little while, which was cool because I didn’t even know elephants could swim, but then it started really struggling to keep its head above water,” said visitor Katie Hayes, 32, who attended the 1 p.m. Elephant Drowning performance with her family after seeing a sign advertising the show simply as “SeaWorld’s Newest Experience.” “My kids were cheering for it at first, and we all thought it might do some tricks or something. But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time, trying to get out of there.”  “And then it drowned,” Hayes added.  “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”  Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced, silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank, and then walked out through the backstage door, all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way. Additionally, many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring, or at least mention the elephant’s name, but noted that no one ever did.  Over the course of the half-hour show, the 12,000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked, making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure. Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank’s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself.  Advertisement  “It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point, which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety, which would have been incredible—but nope,” said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern, 22, who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced, given the animal’s continuous, ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass. “Eventually, the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling, trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely.”  “I really wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule,” she added. “But, yeah, it was pretty much just an elephant drowning.”    Advertisement  Visitors said that following some violent, last-ditch floundering, the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed. Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank, where it came to rest in a heap, its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling.  “No one really told us when the show was over,” said season-pass holder Mariam O’Neill, 57. “After the elephant didn’t move for a while, people got up and started leaving. A few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore’s Sea Lion High show, which was coming up next.”  Advertisement  According to sources, the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month, with the Saturday afternoon show in particular, which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf, regularly filling to capacity.  When reached for comment, SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park’s website.  Advertisement  “SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors,” company representative Nancy Klemmer said. “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”  “Plus, the elephants absolutely love it,” Klemmer added."

""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.

A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.

The White House claims that traditional Christmas greetings wish will upset Muslims in host countries and will have to convicted and returned to the sender.Per executive order,all overseas military mail will be monitored for references to Christmas, Jesus Christ, or pork products which are known to offend Muslims.An Army Veteran who reached out to Fox News said Pentagon leadership is “hypersensitive to anyone who says they feel like their rights are being violated.”“It’s extremely frustrating,” the soldier said. “The U.S. Military is living in fear of radical Muslims.”The soldier, who asked not to be identified because he feared being disciplined or assaulted my Muslims, said many people are furious over the censorship“If soldiers cannot speak the name of God, let alone Christ, what are we fighting for?” he asked. “I’ve towed the company line for years but this has pushed me too far to sit quietly while personal liberties are trampled upon.”The soldier said in recent months they have been reminded that they cannot proselytize and they cannot share their faith say anything nice about Jesus or Christianity.“We are strongly discouraged from having any kind of Christian items on our desks or in our offices,” he saidTexas-based Liberty Institute sent a demand letter to the White House, insisting they immediately drop this policy which allows a generic greeting but disallows references to Christmas, which is officially recognized as a national holiday under federal law.Liberty Institute’s Director of Litigation, Hyman Stratcher, responded in a statement, “Obama is once again engaging in unlawful religious discrimination. It is shameful that the military continues to censor religious speech in Christmas cards while allowing atheists,gays, and satanists to send porn,drugs,electronic cigarettes,or any other ungodly thing they want.”Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition applauded the move as a step in the right direction in the quest for improved Islamic relations.""Disbelievers are trying to draw Muslims away from the straight path"".he said,""Christmas Day and associated celebrations are among the ''falsehoods'' for a Muslim to avoid.A Muslim is neither allowed to celebrate the Christmas Day nor is he allowed to congratulate them.Americans on Muslim soil must learn to abide by our customs to ensure peaceful relations.The ban will go into effect December 1st.Military personnel will be given handbooks to explain what can and cannot be sent from home"
E576,1,Wyoming Man Found With 30 Cow Eyeballs In His Rectum,"man cows eyeballs rectum  There's a story that's been sweeping the internet this week regarding a dude in Caper, Wyomingand a routine traffic stop.  Cops instruct the driver to step out of his El Camino for a field sobriety test.  Saudi Millionaire Beats Rape Charge, Claims He 'Fell Into' Teen's V*gina  Suddenly, several eyeballs slide from his right pant leg onto the road. Yes you read that right. Eyeballs.  Roy Tilbott  Cops draw their weapons; confident they have a Silence of the Lambs caliber serial killer on their hands.  But that wasn't the case at all—old Roy Tilbott is merely an eco-conscious, anal retentive butcher with erectile dysfunction.  Now You Can Put Your Dearly Departed's Ashes In A D*ldo!  Oh! That's OK then! That explains everything!  Bovine eyeball from Tilbott's rectum.  The surprisingly articulate, lucid, and resourceful 51 year-old explained in his police report;  “I enjoy eating bovine eyeballs and smuggling them out in my colon was the only way I knew how to get them out without potentially getting caught and fired. Company won't let us take animal scraps home and instead toss them in the landfill. They're a very wasteful company. We should be allowed to take scrap meat and other parts home. The company should start a green initiative. They don't even have recycling at the plant,""  Police find $100 Worth Of Walmart Groceries In Woman's V*gina  Tilbott came clean, telling cops he has smuggled several thousand eyeballs from the plant in just the past few months!  “I put them in soups. They're beneficial for erectile dysfunction, which I currently battle, but I also just like the texture and taste.""  In spite of his eloquence and compelling argument, Tilbott blew two times the legal limit and was arrested for driving under the influence—police are still waiting to hear from Tilbott's employers whether or not to charge him with the eyeball theft.  Sadly however, as Snopes points out, this hugely popular viral 'story' is 100% false. The photo in the original article is actually a man named James Joe Nordwall, a serial rapist who was sentenced to 100 years in prison in 2014.

E300,1,Are You Eating Chemical Laden Garlic from China?,"Did you know that over 80 percent of the garlic sold worldwide comes from China? In fact, a large amount of garlic we consume here in America is from China. The US imported 138 million pounds last year. Most consumers think that their garlic was grown in California, the “Garlic Capital of the World,” but in reality it was shipped from China. Even “organic” garlic is often from China, where organic certification methods can not be trusted.  Chinese garlic is bleached. According to Henry Bell of the Australian Garlic Industry Association, garlic from China is sprayed with chemicals to stop sprouting, to whiten garlic, and to kill insects and plant matter. He also reports that garlic is grown in untreated sewage, “Bell also calls into question some growing practices in China. “I know for a fact that some garlic growers over there use raw human sewage to fertilize their crops, and I don’t believe the Australian quarantine regulations are strict enough in terms of bacteria testing on imported produce,” he says. “I also challenge the effectiveness of the Chinese methyl bromide fumigation processes.” (http://www.theage.com.au/news/epicure/freshe…) .  Chinese garlic is heavily fumigated with methyl bromide to get rid of any bugs. Methyl bromide is a very toxic hazard. Exposure to high concentrations can cause damage to the respiratory and central nervous systems, even death. According to the UN it is 60 times more damaging than chlorine and is the base of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons).  Chinese garlic is also contaminated with lead, sulfites and other unsafe compounds.  Chinese garlic may be treated with growth inhibitors and subjected to cold temperatures, as well as over-storage. Over storage is particularly problematic as levels of allicin, one of the major constituents in garlic responsible for its health benefits, start to decline over time.  Fortunately, you can easily spot the difference between California-grown fresh garlic and imported garlic.  Here’s how to spot a California-grown bulb:  American garlic has some of the roots left on the bottom.  American garlic is heavier than imported garlic.  American garlic is much more flavorful.

E20,1,IKEA forced to deny they are selling Swastika-shaped table named Hadølf,"IKEA has been forced to deny that they are selling a table shaped like a swastika after a doctored image was posted online.  The picture, claiming to be from an Italian IKEA catalogue shows a swastika table called Hadølf, sparked online outrage after it went viral in Germany.  The flatpack furniture giant is now planning on taking legal action once they have tracked down the source of the doctored photograph.  Online hoax: The fake swastika table called Hadølf was claimed to have been available at IKEA in Italy  'It is of course clear that such a table is not part of our program, either in Italy or anywhere else,' an IKEA spokesperson told The Berliner Zeitung.  In addition to the obvious - that no such table exists - Hadølf's fake price of 88 euro is another loud hoax alarmbell.  The number 88 has long been an abbreviation code for Heil Hitler, a the letter H is the eight in the alphabet.  However it did not stop the reports of the 'Hadølf'-table going around the world, and the furniture chain warned that legal consequences would follow if the person could be tracked down.  Fighting back: IKEA is now planning on taking legal action against the person behind the photograph  Links to Nazi-Germany is a particularly sensitive subject for the Swedish furniture giant, as its founder Ingvar Kamprad was a member of a neo-Nazi group in his youth.  However, when this was revealed in the early 1990s, the 89-year-old billionaire called it youthful 'stupidity'.  Mr Kamprad called his brief involvement 'the greatest mistake of his life', and asked his staff, in particular those of Jewish descent, for forgiveness."
E594,1,"What was fake on the Internet this week: mutant daisies, Nazi minions and demonic birthday cakes","An early 20th-century photo of early British divers, wearing helmets that are kind of minion-like, has been circling the Web for quite some time. But at some point since the release of this latest movie, Venezuela’s El Nacional reports, people began dating the photo to World War II. And that kicked off an incredible string of conspiracy theories: that the photo depicted Jewish children used in Nazi experiments; that Nazi soldiers thought these children spoke amusing gibberish because many weren’t German; that “minion” was actually the word the children used for the Germans."
E171,1,This Artist Made Soy Sauce Out of Human Hair,"Nicolas Lobo’s soy sauce made from his own hair. Photo: ? Sarah Trigg  At the time I met with Nicolas Lobo, his studio was located across the street from an ancient Tequesta Indian burial ground on a bend of Miami’s Little River. The area was once a citrus grove, and the house Lobo was living in had belonged to the grove’s owners. Lobo’s partner, Muriel Olivares, grows crops for her CSA (Community-Supported Agriculture) co-op in the yard. The visit began with a lunch they had prepared using fresh produce from the garden.  We entered a clean, drywall-covered garage, which Lobo had turned from a shell into a studio.  Lobo’s work, mostly three-dimensional, is abstracted from his research into the culturally obscure and abhorrent. For Soylent Green Bust (2009), Lobo covered a steel form with a patina replicating the chemical composition of the substance the characters in the 1973 science-fiction film Soylent Green eat in the overpopulated world of 2022. At the film’s climax, a detective played by Charlton Heston uncovers that “Soylent Green is people!” Lobo explained:  The question was: could we make Soylent Green without actually dissolving bodies? Because when you dissolve a body in acid, it ends up as amino acids. The things we eat now often artificially simulate something we don’t have access to, which I thought was more interesting than trying to get a body and dissolving it. Basically, it’s artificial Soylent Green made of amino acids and algae powders and binders.  In another work, a video, Lobo appears clad in protective gear filling a fire extinguisher (a technique popular with graffiti artists) with two gallons of grape-flavored cough syrup, a semicontrolled substance because of its recreational abuse by teens and rappers. In the video, Lobo methodically sprays a blank, white wall ceiling to floor with the purple-toned spray, accompanied by the pop song “U Smile” by Justin Bieber. The song is slowed by 800 percent, transforming it into an ethereal, transcendent drone. By the end of the fifteen-minute video, the purple stain on the wall has evaporated. The piece is a riff on the rap subgenre “chopped and screwed” (also associated with grape “sizzurp”), in which hip-hop music is slowed and remixed.  Of procuring the sought-after cough syrup, Lobo explained, “I had to buy by the ounce. You have to go to a lot of stores because you can’t buy it all at one store.”  One of Lobo’s many receipts from buying grape-flavored cough syrup for his video “Grape Syrup Action for Paul Octavian Nasca’s ‘U Smile 800% Slower,” 2011. Photo: ? Sarah Trigg  Toward the end of the visit, Lobo casually mentioned he had some residue left over from a precursor to the Soylent Green investigation. Lobo had heard an urban myth that dissolved human hair was being sold as counterfeit soy sauce in China, the validity of which he had decided to test by making his own. “It worked,” Lobo said, “I shaved my head and put the hair in an acid bath to break it down to its basic aminos. Then I neutralized the acid, and it tastes like soy sauce. It’s a little greasier.”  Lobo still had a few samples left in his studio refrigerator. No, I didn’t have the guts to taste it.

E703,1,Peanut Butter and Jelly Deemed Racist,"Oh the times we live in where food can be deemed racist. In a move Oprah would be proud of, Principal Verenice Gutierrez, of the Harvey Scott K-8 School in Portland, has labeled peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as racist.  Apparently, in a move distinguished by the superintendant of the school, an effort was made to, “improve education for students of color.”  Tell me, how does the lunch selection improve the implementation of education?  This is so far beyond politically correct it’s dumfounding. Gutierrez has determined that the fact that the PB&J is on bread, it leads to cultural sensitivity.  Now let’s break that down.  The principal states that certain students that belong to minorities, take for example, “Somali or Hispanic students,” may not have culturally eaten bread, but instead used things like torta, or pitas.  She says that the school must, “change their teaching practices to boost minority students’ performance,” in order to cancel out all the “white privilege.”  I’ve about had it with the accusations of racism from the left, and frankly, this is taking it too far.  So now this school has to spend MORE money to buy a product suitable for the minority in order to accommodate political correctness?  It’s bread.  It can’t use racial slurs, it can’t discriminate and it’s crucial in making a PB&J.  I guess I have to go to the store and pick up some wheat bread now to promote loaf diversity in my kitchen.  We wouldn’t want anyone feeling left out, would we?"
pheme_237,1,No Prince concert: Live Nation apologizes for 'incorrect' information,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.  Prince has performed several times in Toronto, and owned a home in Canada’s largest city when he was married to Toronto-born Manuela Testolini from 2001 to 2006.  He released his latest record, ""Art Official Age,"" in September.  Donna Grantis, a guitarist in 3rdeyegirl, is from nearby Mississauga.  With a report from CTV Toronto's Andria Case"
E234,1,AFRICAN-AMERICAN AIRLINES,"[mpoverlay]DALLAS – Tyler Perry reportedly made an offer to buy American Airlines. They accepted. The new airline: African-American Airlines.  The Texas-based AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, announced that the company filed petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, “in order to achieve a cost and debt structure that is industry competitive and thereby assure its long-term viability and ability to continue delivering a world-class travel experience for its customers.”  WWN has learned that wealthy actor-director Tyler Perry has made an attractive offer for American Airlines. The offer, said to be near $5 billion dollars, was quickly accepted by the airline.  “Mr. Perry made a bold and brilliant move… he is the smartest mogul in the country,” said a source close to American Airlines. “No other businessman would have the guts to try to bail out the biggest airline in the United States.”  Perry, the creator of the “Madea” character and the “House of Payne” sitcom, reportedly plans to rename American Airlines – African-American Airlines. The new Perry run airline will be targeted to African-American passengers, but industry experts say that many white, asian and latino passengers will want to fly the airline, “just to be cool.”  Sources close to American Airlines said the sale to Perry is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.  Perry said he will not only be the CEO of the new airline, but he also will be the CFO, the COO, the CIO, the director of human sources and, of course, he will pilot many of the AAA flights.  American said it is operating normal flight schedules, honoring tickets and reservations, and making normal refunds and exchanges – during the transition period.  Perry reportedly said he will slowly implement new changes. “I want every flight to be a positive experience for all passengers and I hope to turn every flight into a morality play of sorts.”  How will Perry turn a flight into a morality play? “He hasn’t figured that out yet, but there will be a Madea character on every flight,” said Perry’s limo driver.  This will be Perry’s first airline, but sources say he plans to buy an airline every year for the next twenty years.  [/mpoverlay]  (Visited 172 times, 2 visits today)"
pheme_76,1,The real artist behind iconic Charlie Hebdo pencil tribute,"Hours after the deadly terror attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, a powerful image of three pencils was widely shared on social media.  It was posted on a popular, though unverified, ""Banksy"" Instagram account without any attribution to the original artist. It quickly racked up more than 100,000 likes. We shared it, too.  But the illustration wasn't by Banksy, nor did it belong to the fake ""Banksy"" account. It was by Lucille Clerc, a London-based graphic designer, illustrator and printmaker — and it looks way better without a filter:  A photo posted by Lucille Clerc (@lucille_clerc) on Jan 1, 2015 at 2:12pm PST  Clerc, who shared it on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, wrote the caption: ""Break one, thousand will rise."" She added the hashtag #raiseyourpencilforfreedom.  On Thursday, Clerc told us that she wasn't upset about the confusion. She wrote:  This is irrelevant, I don’t want it to turn into polemic and distract people from the real issues. There are way more important things to talk about at the moment, and in the end what matters is that this image speaks to people, so the more it spreads the better it is. I am French and a woman and I was lucky enough to grow up in a free country. I never had to fight for my freedom of speech or opinion, neither for my right to be educated. This is my treasure, this is our most precious treasure. I believe in these values and so many people do just as much. I am truly devastated and all my thoughts are for the victims and their families, there are no words to express how much they will be missed. My drawing was a spontaneous reaction, I didn’t expect it would have such an echo. Ideas don’t break, ideas don’t die. Charlie became immortal yesterday and I hope that this terrible day will make us cherish and protect our freedom with even more wit and humour. I can only hope it will inspire people to use their pencils too and that there will be thousands of drawings like this very soon.  About the attack  Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, two of whom remain at large.  The gunmen, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.  Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.  Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.  The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.  Additional reporting by Mashable staff. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments."

If I could just get a raccoon to blow into this..."" — J.J. (@JJGertler) September 30, 2015 Hmm. Good point.  We’re sorry, Internet, but it's just not true.  Asked if it was fact or fiction, 1st. Lt. Savannah Frank, a public affairs officer at Camp Pendleton, checked and replied: “I called police records, and while they were highly entertained, they confirmed (the story) is absolutely a hoax.”  The far-fetched story about an inebriated military man and a commandeered raccoon emerged on Imgur (""The most viral images on the Internet"") several days ago, with a photograph of what was purported to be a police ""incident report"" from Saturday.  After a night of drinking, it read, a petty officer 1st class failed the breathalyzer test that allows his car to start. In a moment of alcohol-fueled ingenuity, he visited a nearby park, kidnapped a raccoon, and forced the creature to blow into the machine.  It worked, the report claimed, but the experience was too much for the furry animal, and it lost consciousness. The sailor tossed the limp raccoon aside and started driving.  But the creature woke up, according to the account, and with a fury that only a raccoon who is forced to blow into a breathalyzer can possess, began to scratch and bite the drunk man, who then smashed his car through a fence and into a pool.  The bogus raccoon report  At least they hedged it The point is people who should normally be skeptical bought this tall tale.

As anyone who has tried to pick up a raccoon can attest (Do not try this. You will bleed.) it was all a fake.  Frank said the official incident number featured in the post was a giveaway, since Camp Pendleton police records use a different system.  Just to be thorough, though, the officials who work with police records on base went through the incident logs and found no breathalyzer incidents involving raccoons.  Which was, although to be expected, kind of sad."

E47,1,Stanley Kubrick Admits He Helped NASA Fake Moon Landings In New Film?,"A new film by filmmaker T. Patrick Murray has recently surfaced in which famed director Stanley Kubrick allegedly gives an interview admitting that the moon landings were faked. The interview took place 3 days prior to Kubrick’s death on March 7th 1999, and Murray was told he could not release the footage until 15 years after Kubricks’ death. He was allegedly forced to sign an 88-page NDA to keep the contents of the interview a secret for those years, and Murray states that, in accordance with this ruling, in 48 hours he will release the full edit. This should be Dec 11th 2015. [3]  Why all the ‘alleged’ talk? Because it has been tough to verify some of these details, given the type of film this is and how it was released. It appears as though the filmmaker was fearful about the release and thus made it difficult to trace and track further details. I intend to continue to track down the filmmaker and release updates as I get them.  “A, a, a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They SHOULD know.” – Stanley Kubrick  “There are great ideas, undiscovered breakthroughs available, to those who can remove one of truths protective layers.” – Neil Armstrong, allegedly the first man on the moon  Background Story  I should mention that I have been looking into the moon landings for years. I’ve scoured hundreds of videos and many interviews and after it all my belief is that humans have certainly gone to the moon, but I do not believe that the initial missions we saw on TV were legitimate. I do believe astronauts in some of the later Apollo missions went to the moon, but I am not convinced at all on Apollo 11. I believe it was part of a program to get funding for weapon building and more while entering into a “for fun” race with Russia to see who could get to the moon first.  I’m not going to go into all details about this as it can go on forever, instead I will say if one were to truly look into all evidence gathered over the period of time since the initial moon landing in 1969, one would be forced to reach a truly striking conclusion: it is quite unclear if it actually happened. The topic has been debated for many years and evidence has been presented on both sides. Looking at both sides of the argument objectively, you could easily walk out with a conclusion on either side – and that’s kind of exciting to me. It means the trek to a mysterious place in our solar system is just as mysterious as the place itself.  Unlike the events of 9/11, where the evidence and information available certainly discredits the official story, the moon landings have a different feel and to be honest, if this Kubrick interview is in fact legitimate, it is the only piece I have been able to find that would fully confirm my belief in what happened in 1969 with the moon landings.[4]  “Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it bluntly, that’s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.” – Stanley Kubrick  The Space Race  The Space Race took place between 1957 and 1975, and it involved a race for supremacy in space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States. Around the time of the alleged moon landing, the Soviet Union was leading this race, having logged over 500 more hours in space than the US.[2]  In June 1969, they were the first to launch an unmanned spaceship to the moon in order to gather the first ever soil sample from a world other than Earth. As fate would have it, their lunar probe crashed on the moon’s surface and so it was unable to bring back the sample.  The Soviets were also first to launch the first satellite, first animal, and first man into space. They followed these feats with the first space walk, first crew of three in space, and the first ever mission with simultaneous spacecrafts in space at one time. The Soviets had a stranglehold on the space race and the US was not pleased — at least on the surface. I say this because I believe that, behind the scenes, the US and Russia were working together, much like they always have. To the public and even government, however, their relationship appears quite different.  Given there was a great deal of political promise during the time, fear began to develop in the minds of US political personnel as it became a reality that the US would likely never catch the Soviets. Considering the incredible amount of tax-payer money that was going into the Apollo program, however, success of the program was of utmost importance. This desperation is one of the reasons skeptics first began exploring the truth of the moon landing, as human ego and the thirst for pride, along with possibly even more reasons, could explain why certain events took place during the Apollo missions that don’t have the most clear explanations.  Months after the Soviets had launched their initial probe to the moon to obtain the soil sample, it was reported that Apollo 11 had landed on the moon and Neil Armstrong took the first steps any human had ever taken on the moon. This immediately shot the US to the top of the space race, and the world was stunned. But not everyone believed this to be true. The debate over the moon landing’s legitimacy has been going on since before the shuttle even launched. Many were already suspecting that either country would try to outdo the other by any means necessary.[2]  History of Apollo Program  The Apollo program was created in an attempt to not only send humans into space, but to also explore worlds outside of our own. Mainly, the intention was to one day visit the surface of the moon and learn more about the mysterious rock that fills our night sky. The following are the various missions of the Apollo program. [1]  Apollo 1 – Target launch date Feb 21st, 1967. Cabin fire during testing on Jan 27th 1967 killed the crew and the mission was shut down.  Apollo 4 – Launched November 9th, 1967. An unmanned mission to test flight into space.  Apollo 5 – January 22nd, 1968. A test flight of the lunar module into earth’s orbit.  Apollo 6 – April 4th, 1968. An unmanned test flight into earth’s orbit.  Apollo 7 – October 11th, 1968. A three man crew launched into earth’s orbit for 11 days.  Apollo 8 – December 21, 1968. A manned mission to space. Orbited the moon 10 times.  Apollo 9 – March 3rd, 1969. Manned mission in low earth orbit to test lunar landing module.  Apollo 10 – May 18, 1969. Manned mission towards moon. Lunar landing module was tested once again.  Apollo 11 – July 20th, 1969. The famous shuttle that allegedly landed on the moon.  Apollo 12 – November 14th, 1969. 2nd spacecraft to allegedly land on the moon.  Apollo 13 – April 11th, 1970. Manned mission to the moon, technical issues caused the mission to end early.  Apollo 14 – January 31, 1971. 3rd spacecraft to land on the moon.  Apollo 15 – July 26th, 1971. The 4th spacecraft to land on the moon.  Apollo 16 – April 16th, 1972. The 5th spacecraft to land on the moon.  Apollo 17 – December 7th, 1972. The 6th spacecraft to land on the moon.  In total the program claims to have visited the surface of the moon 6 times before oddly shutting the project down for good.  Kubrick & Moon Landings  This is not the first time Kubrick has been linked to the moon landings. There have been a number of theories going around that link Kubrick to the landings, with some even claiming that he tried to reveal the truth in his movie The Shining by placing clues in the film. Perhaps the most plausible clue is the scene in which Danny wears this Apollo 11 sweater, but generally speaking, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.    However, if Kubrick was in fact most proud of his work on the moon landing, as he allegedly states in the interview below, it would not surprise me that he would put clues like this into his film.  Also, in the original release of 2001: A Space Oddesy, there were a number of credits thanking NASA and many of the aerospace companies that worked with NASA on the moon landings. These credits have since been removed from all subsequent releases of 2001.  One last interesting factor with Kubrick was that his movie Eyes Wide Shut was released on July 16th, 1999. Stanley Kubrick insisted in his contract that this be the date of the release. That may not seem interesting unless you know that July 16th, 1999 marks exactly 30 years to the day since Apollo 11 was launched.  Transcript of The Interview (Video Below)  This is a transcript of the interview with Stanley Kubrick and T. Patrick Murray for the movie Shooting Stanley Kubrick.  K: I’m so preoccupied. With my work, innovation, risk-taking, regrets…  T: Why are you giving this interview?  K: Because, it started to get to me after awhile. Well, this is difficult, because it is the first time I’ve talked about it. (sighs)  T: Sure, take all the time you need.  K: I’ve always been conflicted by it, but not consciously until years later. I was just blown away by the chance, the opportunity, the challenge of making this, this production, and I went into this like it was a regular film, like another regular film of mine, not thinking too much about uh the long term effects of what it would mean to society if it was ever discovered.  T: What are you talking about? I’m dying to know what you’re talking about.  K: Well, a confession of sorts. A movie I made, that nobody is aware of – even though they’ve seen it.  T: A movie you made, no one knows you made? Is that what you said?  K: That’s right. Is that intriguing? Do I have you intrigued?  K: I perpetrated a huge fraud on the American public, which I am now about to detail, involving the United States government and NASA, that the moon landings were faked, that the moon landings ALL were faked , and that I was the person who filmed it.  T: Ok. (laughs) What are you talking…You’re serious. Ok.  K: I’m serious. Dead serious.  K: Yes, it was fake.  T: Ok. Wait. Wait…  T: I don’t want this to be an R-rated film, but seriously, what the blank, but seriously…  T: I, I, I worked almost eight months to secure this once in a lifetime interview that almost no else could ever get, and instead of talking about his sixteen films that I’ve endured since I was a child…That we didn’t land on the moon, you’re saying?  K: No, we didn’t.  K: It was not real.  T: The moon landings were fake?  K: A, a, a.. fictional moon landing. A fantasy. It was not real.  K: Don’t you think it’s important for people to know the truth?  T: The moon landing in ’69, which was two years before my birth…  K: Is total fiction.  T: Total fiction.  T: Is that?…So, that’s the 15 year thing. So that’s makes sense now. That’s why I can’t release it for 15 years now, that makes total sense now.  T: Did we…we didn’t land on the moon you’re saying?  K: No, we didn’t.  T: Why are you telling me?  K: A, a, a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They SHOULD know.  K: Nixon want to uh, they were planning, yeah, he want to fake this, this moon landing…  T: Are you contending that people DON’T want to know the truth about the world, reality, the moon landings…?  K: The government, knowing this, takes advantage of it by perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud.  T: How did you end up giving in? Being complicit with this fraud?  K: I didn’t want to do it.  T: This is NOT where I thought this interview was going!  K: With my help, with my, with my aid, and it is, it is bothering me.  T: I only have this certain amount of time with you. And I’ll talk about whatever you want, but…  T: You’re not…This isn’t some type of joke, or…  K: No. No, it’s not.  T: Or a film within a film thing…  K: Not joking. NOPE.  T: Okay.  K: The conspiracy theorists were right, on this occasion.  T: I don’t know what to ask you first.  K: I thought it was wrong, I just…I didn’t believe in perpetrating a fraud like that.  T: But you did.  K: It also undermined my artistic integrity to do that.  T: Ok, but you ended up saying yes. Why?  K: Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it bluntly, that’s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.  T: Why are you telling me?  K:A, a, a, massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They SHOULD know! Don’t you think it’s important for people to know the truth?  T: Why did they have to fake it? Why? Why would they ever need to do something like that? Why would the government ever want or need to do…  K: It’s no secret that NASA always wanted to fulfill this Kennedy prophecy.  T: Take it from the beginning…  T: I gotta be honest, this is where he (Kubrick) got me. I mean, when I actually put myself in his position, when I actually imagine that he was telling the truth, and that he was presented with this opportunity and if in the one in a billion chance that I lived his life and I was presented with the same opportunity, what would I do?  T: Yeah, he wanted his approval points up and he thought nothing could do it better than this.  T: What a conflict. I mean, gosh, I can’t imagine being presented with that opportunity. On one hand, I’d really would want to do it, but then I’d probably say I’m committing a crime, and lying…  T: It depends, but my guess would be…no, if you’re good, but you would do it.  K: Spielberg, (inaudible) Scorsese, even Woody Allen. There isn’t one of them who wouldn’t do this.  T: I gotta admit: I’d do it. I’d do it too.  T: But they dangled all this power and all this flattery on you, essentially?  K: Yeah, it got to me after awhile. You can listen to so much of that stuff before you start to believe it.  T: They just said you were the greatest and stuff?  K: Yeah, yeah – and I agreed with them.  K: Why are you telling the world? Why does the world need to know that the moon landings aren’t real and you faked them?  K: Which I consider to be my masterpiece.  T: And you can’t take credit, or even talk about…  K: Well, I am now..  T: Right, so you’ll be dead. In ten years, or 15…  K: Right, ten or 15 something like that.  T: So, you can’t talk to Roger Ebert about it. Does that frustrate you?  T: Why did they have to fake it? Why would they have to do that?  K: Because it is impossible to get there.  T: Ok, back up, back up, back up….  Is it Kubrick in the film below? Here is a photo of him in the 1990’s that I was able to dig up.  Has the moon always fascinated you like it has me? Since I was a kid I never got that “beautiful” feeling that many get from the moon. Instead to me it always seemed like something that carried secrets, ET’s and that had a different agenda. Over the years I learned more and more about this.

E556,1,After-Birth Abortion: The pro-choice case for infanticide.,"Just when you thought the religious right couldn’t get any crazier, with its personhood amendments and its attacks on contraception, here comes the academic left with an even crazier idea: after-birth abortion.  No, I didn’t make this up. “Partial-birth abortion” is a term invented by pro-lifers. But “after-birth abortion” is a term invented by two philosophers, Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva. In the Journal of Medical Ethics, they propose:  [W]hen circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. … [W]e propose to call this practice ‘after-birth abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide,’ to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than to that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. Such circumstances include cases where the newborn has the potential to have an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of the family is at risk.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Predictably, the article has sparked outrage. Last week, Reps. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., and Chris Smith, R-N.J., denounced it on the House floor. But it isn’t pro-lifers who should worry about the Giubilini-Minerva proposal. It’s pro-choicers. The case for “after-birth abortion” draws a logical path from common pro-choice assumptions to infanticide. It challenges us, implicitly and explicitly, to explain why, if abortion is permissible, infanticide isn’t.  Let’s look at some of those assumptions.  1. The moral significance of fetal development is arbitrary. I often hear this argument from pro-choicers in the context of time limits on abortion. In a debate last fall, I drew up a timeline of fetal development, week by week. The response from Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, was that it would be arbitrary to use any point in that timeline to draw a legal limit on abortion rights. Giubilini and Minerva seem to share this view. “Abortions at an early stage are the best option, for both psychological and physical reasons,” they write, conspicuously omitting the idea that abortions at an early stage are better than late ones for moral reasons. “Merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life,” they write. “Indeed, many humans are not considered subjects of a right to life,” such as “spare embryos where research on embryo stem cells is permitted” or “fetuses where abortion is permitted.”  Advertisement  Advertisement  Furedi accepts birth as the first logical time limit, though not for reasons of fetal development. (See her comments 44 minutes into this video.) But Giubilini and Minerva push beyond that limit. They note that neural development continues after birth and that the newborn doesn’t yet meet their definition of a “person”—“an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence some (at least) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to her.” Accordingly, they reason, “The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus, that is, neither can be considered a ‘person’ in a morally relevant sense.”  2. Prior to personhood, human life has no moral claims on us. I’ve seen this position asserted in countless comment threads by supporters of abortion rights. Giubilini and Minerva add only one further premise to this argument: Personhood doesn’t begin until sometime after birth. Once that premise is added, the newborn, like the fetus, becomes fair game. They explain:  Advertisement  [I]n order for a harm to occur, it is necessary that someone is in the condition of experiencing that harm. If a potential person, like a fetus and a newborn, does not become an actual person, like you and us, then there is neither an actual nor a future person who can be harmed, which means that there is no harm at all. … In these cases, since non-persons have no moral rights to life, there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions. … Indeed, however weak the interests of actual people can be, they will always trump the alleged interest of potential people to become actual ones, because this latter interest amounts to zero.  Advertisement  You may find this statement cold, but where’s the flaw in its logic? If the neurally unformed fetus has no moral claims, why isn’t the same true of the neurally unformed newborn?  Advertisement  3. Any burden on the woman outweighs the value of the child. Giubilini and Minerva note that philosophers such as Peter Singer have presented arguments for neonaticide for many years. Until now, these arguments have focused on what’s best for the baby—in the words of recent Dutch guidelines, “infants with a hopeless prognosis who experience what parents and medical experts deem to be unbearable suffering.” Giubilini and Minerva merely push this idea one step further, calling their proposal “‘after-birth abortion’ rather than ‘euthanasia’ because the best interest of the one who dies is not necessarily the primary criterion for the choice.”  “Actual people’s well-being could be threatened by the new (even if healthy) child requiring energy, money and care which the family might happen to be in short supply of,” they observe. Accordingly, “if economical, social or psychological circumstances change such that taking care of the offspring becomes an unbearable burden on someone, then people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they cannot afford.” An after-birth abortion might be warranted by any “interests of actual people (parents, family, society) to pursue their own well-being”—including “the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving her child up for adoption.”  Advertisement  Advertisement  4. The value of life depends on choice. Pro-choicers don’t accept the idea that the path from pregnancy to maternity, being natural, must be followed. They argue that the choice is up to the woman. Some assert that the life within her has no moral status until she chooses to give birth to it.  Again, Giubilini and Minerva simply extend this logic beyond birth. Since the newborn isn’t a person yet, its significance continues to hinge on its mother’s decision. Neonates “might or might not become particular persons depending on our choice,” the authors argue. Until then, the newborn imposes no obligations on us, “because we are not justified in taking it for granted that she will exist as a person in the future. Whether she will exist is exactly what our choice is about.”  Advertisement  5. Discovery of a serious defect is grounds for termination. Fetal development can turn tragic at any point. Most people agree that abortion should be permitted when a grave defect is discovered at amniocentesis. In the partial-birth abortion debate, pro-choicers extended this rationale, arguing that abortions in the third trimester should be permitted when horrible defects were identified at that stage. Giubilini and Minerva take this argument to the next level, noting that defects often remain undiscovered until birth:  Advertisement  Advertisement  An examination of 18 European registries reveals that between 2005 and 2009 only the 64% of Down’s syndrome cases were diagnosed through prenatal testing. This percentage indicates that, considering only the European areas under examination, about 1700 infants were born with Down’s syndrome without parents being aware of it before birth. Once these children are born, there is no choice for the parents but to keep the child, which sometimes is exactly what they would not have done if the disease had been diagnosed before birth.  Advertisement  The authors conclude that “if a disease has not been detected during the pregnancy, if something went wrong during the delivery, or if economical, social or psychological circumstances change such that taking care of the offspring becomes an unbearable burden on someone, then people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they cannot afford.” And it isn’t clear where the line against infanticide would be drawn. “We do not put forward any claim about the moment at which after-birth abortion would no longer be permissible,” Giubilini and Minerva write. They doubt that “more than a few days would be necessary for doctors to detect any abnormality in the child.” But critics are already noting that many defects are discovered later.  Advertisement  Advertisement  In sum, the authors argue:  If criteria such as the costs (social, psychological, economic) for the potential parents are good enough reasons for having an abortion even when the fetus is healthy, if the moral status of the newborn is the same as that of the infant and if neither has any moral value by virtue of being a potential person, then the same reasons which justify abortion should also justify the killing of the potential person when it is at the stage of a newborn.  I don’t buy this argument, in part because I agree with Furedi that something profound changes at birth: The woman’s bodily autonomy is no longer at stake. But I also think that the value of the unborn human increases throughout its development. Furedi rejects that view, and her rejection doesn’t stop at birth. As she explained in our debate last fall, “There is nothing magical about passing through the birth canal that transforms it from a fetus into a person.”  The challenge posed to Furedi and other pro-choice absolutists by “after-birth abortion” is this: How do they answer the argument, advanced by Giubilini and Minerva, that any maternal interest, such as the burden of raising a gravely defective newborn, trumps the value of that freshly delivered nonperson? What value does the newborn have? At what point did it acquire that value? And why should the law step in to protect that value against the judgment of a woman and her doctor?

E104,1,Showtime is bringing Dexter back from the dead,"Dexter remains one of the best TV shows to ever grace the small screen. But it ironically makes a less-favorable list, too, as having one of the worst series finales in history. Thankfully, that might change. Showtime has confirmed, much to the delight of its legion of fans, that the series will return for a 10-episode limited series.  The network confirmed the news in a series of tweets, including this one that leaves no room for misinterpretation.  Michael C. Hall brilliantly played the title character, a vigilante serial killer who harnessed his dark and deadly urges to, in his eyes, do good for society. Hall will reprise his role as Dexter Morgan, the Miami Metro Police Department blood spatter analyst by day, green-shirted killer by night. When the series initially ended in 2013, Morgan had presumably left his double life behind, running away to work in the middle of nowhere as a bearded lumberjack.  While the series aired for a total of eight seasons, die-hard fans felt the quality had been waning for the latter half. For the revival, the original showrunner Clyde Phillips will be back on board, news that gives fans giddy chills as they reminisce about the season with The Trinity Killer, played fabulously by John Lithgow, and the inaugural story of the Ice Truck Killer, modeled after the story in the Jeff Lindsay book Darkly Dreaming Dexter on which the show is based. This could be Phillips’ grand redemption.  Murmurs of a reboot or revival have been going since 2015 as fans longed for more satisfying closure. In a TCA press tour back in 2015, then Showtime head David Nevins commented that Dexter was the one Showtime series that truly deserved a resurrection.  (Warning: Spoilers ahead) Many key characters had been killed off by the end, including Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) who played Dexter’s sister. James Remar, however, appeared in flashbacks through the show’s entire run as Dexter’s deceased father. He was a police officer who learned of his son’s dark proclivities when he was just a child and trained him to harness them to take down bad guys who had slipped through the cracks of the justice system. Yvonne Strahovski (The Handmaid’s Tale) had a major role in the show’s final season as well.  What made the story so compelling was that viewers were drawn not only to Dexter’s need to hide and fulfill his powerful urges to kill, but also to balance them with learning how to live the ultimate cover of a “regular” person. That meant trying to fit in by doing expected things like getting married, participating in useless activities like joining a bowling league, and doing thoughtful things like gifting colleagues with donuts every morning. Laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry. Dexter’s journey through the series, the confusion fans felt for rooting for a murderous, psychopathic antihero, and a handful of seriously shocking moments, made the show one of the most water-cooler worthy ones of that decade.  It seems Phillips has always had different ideas for the series, even previously having presented how he would have ended the show: With the camera focused on a close up of Dexter’s eyes. As it pulls back, you see that Dexter is on an execution table in prison. He looks out the window as the drugs are administered and sees his many, many, many victims staring back at him. It would seem the entire show wasn’t a dream, per se, but a vision of Dexter’s life flashing before his eyes in those, the last few seconds of his own life.  Will Phillips stick with this idea or change things up? We’ll have to wait and see. The limited series revival will premiere on Showtime in the fall of 2021.  Editors' Recommendations"
E762,1,FBN’s Charles Payne: Obama Will Make a Push for Slave Reparations,"On Thursday’s broadcast of Fox Business Network’s “Making Money,” host Charles Payne made a bold prediction when he suggested that President Barack Obama would make a push for slavery reparations.  “The news is a glimpse of much bigger news that is going to come from the White House, next year, I’m leaning towards,” Payne said during his “Payne’s Passion” segment. “I think that there’s going to be an official apology from the White House to slavery in America and then a major push to get cash, and I’m talking lots of cash.”  “Many including those closest to President Obama will push him to make this happen,” Payne continued. “I actually think it would be a major mistake. Instead, Obama should really discuss and focus on all of the progress we have made and how all Americans need to move forward for better days for all of our kids.”  (h/t Mediaite)  Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
E110,1,The Black Roots of Ex President Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Spread the love                  317 Shares  Dwight D. Eisenhower had black ancestry via his maternal side, Ida Elizabeth Stover Eisenhower; it was used politically against him by his opponents.  Ida Link’s mother — Elizabeth Link (Eisenhower’s maternal grandmother) has no known family tree:  Why are her parents listed as “unknown”?  She’s a genealogical dead end. But no one is a genealogical dead end unless someone wants them to be.  She was born in Mount Sidney, Virginia,[1] the only daughter of Elizabeth Ida Juda Link and Simon P. Stover.  Here’s the problem: In Mount Sidney to this day there are both black families and white families with the surname “Link”.. Many years ago, a black researcher discovered that Ida’s mother was from the black Links a fact washed away in time by two things:  1. Her mother died when she was five years old.  2. She went to live with a white family after.  3. She moved to Kansas while in her teens.  4. She married a white man."
pheme_251,1,No Prince concert: Live Nation apologizes for 'incorrect' information,"An entertainment company has issued an apology to Prince fans who lined up for hours outside a downtown Toronto venue on Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise show, after it says ""incorrect"" information was posted on a ticketing website.  In a statement posted on Facebook Tuesday night, Live Nation apologized for ""any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto.""  According to the company, Ticketmaster had posted ""incorrect concert information on their website,"" and that the ""only reservation"" for the space was for a production rehearsal.  ""There was no concert scheduled for (Tuesday),"" Live Nation said.  There were also rumours about a second Prince performance scheduled for Wednesday night. Two workers inside Massey Hall told CTV Toronto's Scott Lightfoot that Wednesday's event has also been cancelled.  Earlier in the day, a crowd of fans stood in the rain for hours outside Massey Hall. The line at one point stretched for two blocks past the downtown venue.  Fans who heard rumours about a Prince concert in Toronto on Twitter early Tuesday morning had flocked to the venue, despite the fact the show had not been confirmed.  Officials at Massey Hall were seen setting up crowd-control fences outside the venue Tuesday morning. By noon, lineups had begun outside of the building.  Though fans said they knew the rumours hadn't been confirmed, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to see the star.  A man waiting in line said he'd seen Prince 15 times, but still wanted to see him again. A woman said she'd left work as soon as she heard the news.  The rumours of the surprise show were sparked by a message posted by 3rdeyegirl, an all-female band currently backing the artist.  The message teasing the Toronto show was posted shortly before 7 a.m., and was deleted by 8:30 a.m.  Further fuelling the rumours was a page on the Ticketmaster website that suggested Prince was playing in Toronto Tuesday night, thought the page said the event was no longer on sale.  According to unconfirmed messages posted on social media, wristbands would be handed out starting at 6 p.m. Other unconfirmed reports suggested there would be two shows, one on Tuesday and another on Wednesday.  When asked about the Toronto rumours, Prince's publicist told CTV Toronto that the singer and his manager were in New York. The publicist said he was waiting for a phone call to confirm whether Prince would be in Toronto.  Prince has performed several times in Toronto, and owned a home in Canada’s largest city when he was married to Toronto-born Manuela Testolini from 2001 to 2006.  He released his latest record, ""Art Official Age,"" in September.  Donna Grantis, a guitarist in 3rdeyegirl, is from nearby Mississauga.  With a report from CTV Toronto's Andria Case"
E700,1,Rainbow Registry,"FACT CHECK Are sex offenders required to put transparent rainbows over their Facebook profile pictures?  Claim: Sex offenders are now required to put transparent rainbows over their Facebook profile pictures.  FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2015]  There a new picture from Übertruths going around facebook, It states that Registered Sex offenders are now required to have the transparent rainbow on their profile pictures that people have started to use as support for the newly legalized gay marriage. I need to know how “True” this is because there are now thousands using the generator app to do this in support of their homosexual friends.    Origins: On 27 June 2015, as many Americans celebrated the announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled TARGET=sco that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage, Facebook began offering users a “rainbow filter” they could use to “rainbowize” their Facebook profile pictures (in acknowledgement of the rainbow flag’s status as a symbol of gay/LGBT pride).  Shortly afterwards, however, pranksters took over and began circulating a rumor claiming that the explanation for the explosion of rainbow profile images on Facebook was that sex offenders were now required by that social network to cover their profile pictures with transparent rainbows:  The image shown above was originally posted by the entertainment Facebook group UberTruths, but the photograph and concept soon became the basis for similar stories posted on fake news web sites such as the News Examiner, WIT Science, and Huzlers:  At a press conference this morning, Facebook announced new steps in its efforts to protect minors from pedophiles and other sexual deviants on the popular social media website. “As some of you may have already noticed, registered sex offenders on Facebook now have the colors of a transparent rainbow covering their entire profile image,” Facebook spokesman Paul Horner told reporters. “This will make sexual predators easily identifiable to the community and help keep your children safe.”  This explanation was just one big jape. Many Facebook users did change their profile pictures to incorporate transparent rainbows; but as noted above, they were simply celebrating the just-announced Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage throughout the U.S.:  Super excited about today’s victory for marriage equality? Now you can easily show your support on Facebook. The social network has launched a new tool which lets you add a rainbow filter to your profile photo with a single click. Just head over to Facebook’s new Celebrate Pride page, and you’ll see a preview of your profile photo with the transparent rainbow overlay. If you like how it looks, click the button “use as profile picture” and voila — Facebook will automatically update your profile photo.  In addition to the “Celebrate Pride” page, Facebook offered a congratulatory message from CEO Mark Zuckerberg to the LGBT community:  Our country was founded on the promise that all people are created equal, and today we took another step towards achieving that promise. I’m so happy for all of my friends and everyone in our community who can finally celebrate their love and be recognized as equal couples under the law. We still have much more to do to achieve full equality for everyone in our community, but we are moving in the right direction.    Last updated: 29 June 2015  First published: 29 June 2015"

E702,1,Joni Ernst: Repeal Obamacare And Cut Food Stamps And Force People To Rely On The Church For Help,"By Stephen D. Foster Jr. | 18 October 2014  Addicting Info  The Iowa Senate race is one of the closest in the nation so it stands to reason that insulting and attacking a large portion of the population would be a stupid move. But that’s what Republican candidate Joni Ernst has been doing.  During a Q&A session with reporters, Ernst called for repealing Obamacare, abolishing the Department of Education, and slashing food stamps at the Des Moines Conservative Breakfast Club in 2013. Her solution to healthcare and not starving if she succeeds in doing so? Forcing people to rely on the church for help.  We have to take a good, hard look at entitlement programs. We’re looking at Obamacare right now. Once we start with those benefits in January, how are we going to get people off of those? It’s exponentially harder to remove people once they’ve already been on those programs. We have lost a reliance on not only our own families, but so much of what our churches and private organizations used to do. They used to have wonderful food pantries. They used to provide clothing for those that really needed it, but we have gotten away from that. Now we’re at a point where the government will just give away anything. We have to stop that.  You can listen to the audio via Iowa Public Radio by clicking here.  In addition, Ernst claimed that a “whole generation of people rely on the government to provide absolutely everything for them,” which mirrors Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” claim from 2012. “It’s going to take a lot of education to get people out of that. It’s going to be very painful and we know that,” Ernst added.  As you’ll recall, this frivolous claim largely cost Romney the election that year, and it should cost Ernst her own election this year. Sure, families could seek charity, but private organizations and churches are not hospitals and as most of us know, healthcare is costly. That why we have health insurance, which is now more accessible thanks to Obamacare. Telling the poor to seek medical help from a church is inadequate and cruel. Most churches and private charities just do not have the resources to care for so many. People would end up being turned away.  Also, people don’t use food stamps because they want to, they use them because they have no other choice. Again, charities and churches are not equipped to deal with the number of people in this country who are hungry. But the government is. Furthermore, if Ernst really wants to reduce the number of people who seek government aid, the best solution would be to raise the minimum wage in order to lift millions of Americans out of poverty, but Ernst opposes that idea, even though it would mean people could actually afford to purchase their own healthcare and buy their own food without government assistance.  The fact is, Joni Ernst is heartless like her fellow conservatives. They are obsessed with taking healthcare, food, and education away from people, which will only cause more problems rather than solving them. It’s a backwards path that is bad for Americans and for Iowans.  Be sure to ‘like’ us on Facebook"

What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn’t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!  Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.  Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.  NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.  It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.  I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.  You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!  As long as they remain laying down. You’re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.  NASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.  NASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:  Understanding how one’s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.  Understanding the impact of one’s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.  Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.  The experiment will consist of two categories.  The exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.  During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.  As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted."

You can unsubscribe at any time.  The black box and flight data recorder - crucial in piecing together what happened - have been found and helicopter search operations resumed at first light this morning in near-freezing conditions. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said last night the plane's black box had been found. It has already arrived at Paris and is ready to be investigated by inspectors. Actually orange in colour, the black box comprises the cockpit voice recorder, giving investigators insight into pilots' conversations just before the crash, and the flight data recorder which shows how the workings of the plane were operating. But reports said that the flight's other black box had been damaged, potentially compromising an investigation. This comes as reports claim a mother living in Manchester, who was travelling with her seven-month-old baby and Polish husband had been named as victims of the horror crash, which killed 150 people onboard. The woman, named in reports as Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio is thought to have have been living in Britain - but had returned to Spain for her uncle’s funeral. Speaking this evening, Mr Hammond said: ""I don't want to speculate on numbers of British nationals involved until we have completed our checks on all the passenger information. ""However, based on the information available to us, it is sadly likely that there were some British nationals on board the flight. ""We are providing consular assistance and will give further help as more information becomes available. ""We are working closely with the French, German and Spanish authorities, and the airline, to establish the facts."" As night fell, the air search and resucue operation was called off at 8pm (local time) and will resume at dawn tomorrow. Around 10 police officers will spend the night at the site of the crash, a rescue official confirmed. Earlier today, the first pictures of the crash site emerged after French Prime Minister Manuel Vells said a helicoptor had managed to land near the site and had found no survivors despite earlier reports of a ""moving body"" being spotted among the wreckage. As search teams search for clues behind the mystery crash, it emerged that crew members of the Germanwings plane did not issue a distress call.  matrixpictures.co.uk Pictures of the Germanwings crash site have emerged  AP Parts of the voice data recorder of the Germanwings jetliner  Parlementarian Christophe Castaner told local radio station France Info one of the plane's black box had been found. French authorities have confirmed 144 passengers, two pilots and four stewards were on board - none are believed to have survived. It is thought the dead included 16 German schoolchildren on an exchange to Spain, two teachers, two babies and two leading opera singers. Maria Radner, who had performed all over the world including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and theatres in Milan and Buenos Aires, was travelling with her husband and baby. Fellow performer Oleg Bryjak from Kazakhstan, who interprets Alberich in the opera, also died. It is thought 63 of the passengers were German and the Spanish deputy prime minister has confirmed 45 are Spanish, including two babies. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed the two Australians among the dead as Carol and Greg Friday. The two Australians named as victims were mum Carol, 68, and her son Greig, 29. They were enjoying a European trip together. Gilbert Sauvan, an official with the local council, told Les Echos newspaper: ""The plane is disintegrated. The largest debris is the size of a car."" The Germanwings aircraft, owned by aviation heavyweight Lufthansa, was flying from Barcelona to Dusseldorf when it disappeared from radar at 10.39am local time after air traffic control issued a distress warning - 39 minutes after take-off. It plunged from its cruising height of 40,000 feet to 6,200 feet in 8 minutes, which aviation experts have described as being a ""catastrophic loss"" of altitude. ""It is going to take days to recover the victims, then the debris,"" said senior police officer Jean-Paul Bloy UK Prime Minister David Cameron said his thoughts are ""very much with the families and friends of all those aboard"" and the Foreign Office was making inquiries about whether any Britons were on board.

He added that the plane, which was 24-years-old, had had a normal service at Dusseldorf yesterday and its last major check-up was in the summer of 2013. The Spanish aviation authority has set up a room in Barcelona's El Prat airport for family and friends of the Spaniards on the flight which set off from Barcelona at 9am Spanish time today. The last A320 to crash was AirAsia Flight QZ8501, which was flying from Surabaya to Singapore in December. All 162 people on board died. Today's crash in the Massif des Trois évêchs in the valley of Haute-Bléone, in the Digne region is near the ski resort of Barcelonnette. It is not yet known whether anybody on the ground has been affected but police helicopters were scrambled immediately and have reported debris strewn on the ground. The area is very remote and the only way to reach it is via helicopter or a two and a half hour hike from the nearest village. 244 firefighters and the same number of police are said to be on their way to the scene. UK weather experts said conditions in the area at the time of the crash were ""nothing out of the ordinary"" but by Tuesday afternoon there was chilly rain falling.

pheme_73,1,"German Airbus crashes in French Alps with 150 dead, black box found","SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (Reuters) - An Airbus operated by Lufthansa’s Germanwings budget airline crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday, killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren.  Germanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board.  One of the plane’s black box recorders has been found at the crash site, about 100 km (65 miles) north of the Riviera city of Nice, and will be examined immediately, France’s interior minister said.  In Washington, the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack, while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident, adding that any other theory would be speculation.  Aerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines.  “We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart, the bodies are in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage,” Brice Robin, prosecutor for the city of Marseille, told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter.  Germanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight. Spain’s deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also aboard.  Also among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany, a spokeswoman said.  Barcelona’s Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers, Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner, had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner’s Siegfried at the theater.  French police at the crash site about 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms.  Police said search teams would stay overnight at altitude. “We are still searching. It’s unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday,” regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters.  In Paris, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament: “A helicopter managed to land (by the crash site) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors.”  It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago. The A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world’s most used passenger jets.  It has a good safety record. However, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Tuesday’s crash was the third most deadly involving an A320. In 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil, killing 187 people, while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December.  SHARP DESCENT  Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes.  “The aircraft’s contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,” Germanwings’ Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday.  Experts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly, its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky.  France’s DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus.  “The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft’s descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,” a DGAC spokesman said.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  In emergencies, pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority, then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground.  The aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing, hiking and rafting, but which is hard for rescue services to reach. The search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes, which has a small private aerodrome nearby.  STORMS, SNOW, CLOUD  As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled, the weather was reported to be closing in.  “There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon, with local storms, snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds. That will not help the helicopters in their work,” an official from the local weather center told Reuters.  Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, who planned to go to the crash site, spoke of a “dark day for Lufthansa”.  “My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew,” Lufthansa said on Twitter, citing Spohr.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday. Germanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there.  Family members arrived at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, many crying and with arms around each others’ shoulders, accompanied by police and airport staff.  In Llinars del Valles, the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren, Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught. “The families knew each other,” he told Reuters. “The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.”  King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims. They had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened.  In Washington, President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the “awful tragedy”.  Airbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old, having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991. It was powered by engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France’s Safran."
politifact15147,1,International Arrest Warrant Issued for George Soros,"George Soros—the Billionaire investment banker who has admitted to manipulating the financial markets in Asia, the UK, Greece, and Russia has finally gone too far.  You see Mr. Soros has become persona non grata across the globe for his role in destabilizing country’s economy’s and financial markets. He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.  George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.  He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.  Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the ‘90’s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.  Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.  Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change. We’ll have to see. To learn more, check out the provided video below."

pheme_87,1,Prince Secret Show Rumored for Toronto Tonight,"Update: Live Nation says it ""can confirm that Prince will not be performing at Massey Hall tonight.""  Fans and music business types started lining up early Tuesday morning outside Toronto's Massey Hall for a rumored concert tonight by Prince and the metal barricades put out on the sidewalk outside the historic theatre seem to confirm they are right.  Tickets are said to be just $10. One rumour is that Prince himself will be selling them. Another is that there will also be a show tomorrow night.  The excitement started in the middle of the night with a redrum-styled cryptic message on the Twitter account of Prince's all-female backing band 3RDEYEGIRL that was deleted around 8:30 a.m. ""4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…"" it read.  OTNOROT spelled forwards is Toronto, of course, and over the weekend Prince was a short plane ride away in New York City for an appearance on Saturday Night Live. Ticketmaster also has a page with Prince's photo that says he is playing Massey Hall tonight. The venue is dark until Sarah McLachlan's concerts on Thursday and Friday.  Breakfast Television host Kevin Frankish, whose studio is around the corner from the 2765-capacity venue, wandered over to interview a couple of the 10 or so people in line at 9 a.m. and told them, ""I have it on good authority that he is playing here tonight. I talked to some sources. Apparently the drum sets are already set up there, we're told last night, to get everything set and that that's what they're saying.  ""I'm not going to go 100 percent,"" he added, ""but I have some pretty good sources saying that it's 99 percent.""  Music publicist Rebecca Webster told Billboard via email, ""I'm number four in line. I arrived just after 8 a.m. this morning after tip on a tweet around 2 a.m. last night. Seeing as it's Prince playing in the best venue in Canada -- Massey Hall -- there was every reason to be the first to see if the rumour would become reality. And, it looks like the rumour is paying off! Thanks to technology, my office for the day is the Victoria street sidewalk, as I tether wifi from my phone.""  Music management consultant Scott Morin, sporting a Prince t-shirt, told CP24, ""I got up at 4:30 a.m. because I had a Twitter alert wake me up from his band with a cryptic message saying they were on their way to Toronto. That was enough for me. Prince has redefined popular music for 40 years. Him and Miles Davis are the two greatest artists to ever live in my opinion.""  Around 11:30 a.m., former music journalist Paul Cantin posted on Facebook: ""Lineup for surprise Prince gig at Massey Hall. I'm in line. Maybe 150 people ahead of me. Nobody in line knows anything.

The photo below, which is acutely disturbing no matter the context, purports to show a mysterious two-legged creature with a peculiar face and bizarre overall body structure:  Daily Star / IMGUR  The esteemed Daily Star reports that the photos of this admittedly alien-like creature, apparently discovered in San Jose, were posted to Reddit and Facebook. “I heard something scream at like 11:30 last night and went on my side yard and found this thing,” Facebook user Gianna Peponis wrote. “It was dead when I found it.”  Daily Star / Facebook  Due to the fact that this creature was discovered at the hot spot for that aforementioned UFO, which Chris Brown still believes was alien-related, the Internet has now imploded into the real-life manifestation of some awful but kind of genius Independence Day reboot:  Once again, aliens could not be reached for comment."
politifact13560,1,Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because “Santa Was Always White In The Bible”,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.  Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.  She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”  “That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”  “Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded."
pheme_271,1,Germanwings crash: Plane obliterated,"That's how German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier described the site where a Germanwings Airbus A320 plane crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday.  ""The grief of the families and loved ones is immeasurable,"" Steinmeier said, after flying over the area in the Alps in southeastern France. ""We must stand with them. We are all united in great grief.""  Last known location: Near Digne-les-Bains, France, in the Alps  Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m.  Flight 9525 took off just after 10 a.m. Tuesday from Barcelona, Spain, for Dusseldorf, Germany, with 144 passengers -- among them two babies -- and six crew members. It went down at 10:53 a.m. (5:53 a.m. ET) in a remote area near Digne-les-Bains in the Alpes de Haute Provence region.  All aboard are presumed dead.  Helicopter crews found the airliner in pieces, none of them bigger than a small car, and human remains strewn for several hundred meters, according to Gilbert Sauvan, a high-level official in the Alpes de Haute Provence region who is being briefed on the operation.  Authorities were not able to retrieve any bodies Tuesday, with the frozen ground complicating the effort. Wednesday may not be much easier, with snow in the forecast.  Spanish and German officials moved to join hundreds of French firefighters and police in the area, working together to help in the recovery effort and try to figure out exactly what happened. As of Tuesday evening, there were few clues.  One of the aircraft's data recorders, the so-called black boxes, has been found, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash.  ""We don't know much about the flight and the crash yet,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. ""And we don't know the cause.""  Students, teachers among the victims  Relatives of those believed to be on the flight, fearing the worst, gathered at the Barcelona airport, where a crisis center was set up. French authorities set up a chapel near the crash site.  Lufthansa Group said the company will look after the relatives of those on board. ""There will be a contact center established in France; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established,"" Lufthansa said.  Those aboard included a ""high number of Spaniards, Germans and Turks,"" according to Spain's King Felipe VI. Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said it's believed 67 people, or nearly half those on the plane, are German citizens.  Sixteen students and two teachers from one German high school, called Joseph Koenig Gymnasium, were among those booked on Flight 9525, according to Florian Adamik, a municipal official in Haltern, the town where the school is located. A crisis center has been established at the city hall in Haltern, which is about 77 kilometers (48 miles) north of Dusseldorf's airport.  Winkelmann confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane.  Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program.  ""The whole city is shocked, and we can feel it everywhere,"" Klimpel said.  A Dutch citizen and a Belgian -- the latter a resident of Barcelona -- were among those on the flight, according to those countries' foreign ministries. Two Australians and two Colombians were also believed to be on board.

Germanwings is a low-cost airline owned by the Lufthansa Group. Hide Caption 26 of 26  Germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by Lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline, handling an increasing number of midrange flights around Europe.  It was forced to cancel some flights Tuesday because there were crews that didn't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash.  Mountainous terrain  The valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered, and access is difficult, said the mayor of the nearby town of Barcelonnette, Pierre Martin-Charpenel. It was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now, he said.  It's an out-of-the-way place with magnificent scenery, he said.  The mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access.  The sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash, said Sandrine Julien from the town hall of Seyne-les-Alpes village. Seyne-les-Alpes is about 10 kilometers from the crash site.  Mountain guide Yvan Theaudin told BFMTV the crash was in the area of the Massif des Trois Eveches, where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters (1.9 miles). It's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening, he said, which could complicate search and rescue efforts.  Responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground, he said.  Sandrine Boisse, president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened.  ""It was about 11 (a.m.) here. I was outside the garage, and we heard a strange noise, and at first we thought it was an avalanche,"" she said. ""Something was wrong. ... We didn't know what.""  A mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash, Michel Suhubiette, said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site.  Plane plummeted for eight minutes  According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, just under 16% of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent. Accidents are more common during takeoff and landing.  16% of accidents are while flight cruises; vast majority are during takeoff, maneuvering, landing, per @FAANews: pic.twitter.com/1hXtP3CH0n — Josh Levs (@JoshLevs) March 24, 2015  The twin-engine Airbus A320 , which entered service in 1988, is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft, aviation analyst David Soucie said.  The captain of the crashed plane had flown for Germanwings for more than 10 years, and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of Airbus. The plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in Dusseldorf on Monday, according to Winkelmann.  So what happened? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the plane's speed is one clue.  According to Germanwings, the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for eight minutes. The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet. Then it crashed.  This could indicate that there was not a stall, but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent, Schiavo said.  Had there been an engine stall, the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes, she said.  That small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing, or that the plane was gliding with the pilot's guidance, Schiavo said.  A scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains, she said.  Merkel: 'Think of the victims'  The crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened.  ""Our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in Europe, especially the people of Germany and Spain, following the terrible airplane crash in France,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters. ""It's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children, some of them infants.""  Germany's Merkel said she was sending two ministers to France on Tuesday and would travel to the crash site on Wednesday to see it for herself.  ""We have to think of the victims and their families and their friends,"" she said.  German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the German government had set up a crisis center in response to the ""terrible news"" and was in close contact with the French authorities.  ""In these difficult hours, our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew,"" he said."
pheme_339,1,'Banksy' Reacts To Paris Attack With Poignant Drawing,"Banksy appears to have shared a message of sorrow and hope Wednesday after an attack on the Paris office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo left 12 people dead.  The drawing was shared from an Instagram account and Facebook page that many believe are associated with the enigmatic street artist. Both posts carried only the message ""RIP"".  That said, there is debate about the authenticity of the image. The page the drawing was shared from was initially verified by Facebook, but that verification was later removed. Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks told Animal New York that the page is ""100 per cent fake.""  Many have speculated, however, that the denials are all part of cultivating Banksy's puzzling persona.  The Guardian and Mashable have both identified Instagram post as being authentic. However, in 2013 The New York Times identified a different Instagram account as being linked to the artist.  Regardless of whether the real Banksy is behind the drawing, there's no denying it's a powerful image.  Related on HuffPost:"

""Unity"" he said, ""is our best weapon.""  Map: Standoffs near Paris, France  That kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days.  It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.  And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.  ""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""  Parts of France on high alert  This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.  They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them.

MUST WATCH Paris attack's tragic timeline 02:31  Authorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Dammartin-en-Goele, whom Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas. Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.  Ties to Islamist extremists  As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.  Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.  Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.  Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.  Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.  His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""  ""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""  Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.  A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.  Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.  Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.  The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

E445,1,Aircraft Resembling MH370 Found in Warehouse Belonging to CNN,"CASA GRANDE, Az. – DEA agents and sheriff’s deputies with the Pinal County Narcotics Task Force made a startling discovery Tuesday while serving a drug warrant that ended in a botched raid. County officials say a typo on the official search warrant lead law enforcement officers to the wrong location, a warehouse in Casa Grande, where, instead of a methamphetamine operation, they found a Boeing 777 commercial airliner and a sedan.  “Upon entering the premises, Pinal County Sheriff’s deputies observed a large commercial airliner parked in the center of the warehouse,” Pinal County’s Chief Investigator Adam Hutch told reporters. “The aircraft in question is white, with a gray underbelly and features red and blue stripes down the middle of fuselage.” Hutch said the plane’s tail prominently displays the all-too-familiar red and blue logo of Malaysian Airlines. Additionally, its registration number, 9M-MRO, matches that of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014.  “Right now we are trying to determine the origin of this aircraft,” Hutch said, adding that airliner was carrying “less than a quarter tank” of fuel. Public records show the warehouse in question is located on privately owned land in the outskirts of Casa Grande and has been on lease to CNN since March 6, 2014. The twenty-four hour cable news channel declined a request to comment from this reporter but Ted Turner, owner of Turner Broadcasting System Inc, the parent company of CNN, told The New York Times that he found the discovery “very peculiar,” and added, “I have no idea why that would be there.”  During CNN’s The Situation Room Tuesday, Wolf Blitzer was pointedly asked by a guest what his thoughts on the aircraft were. Mr. Blitzer blinked several times while staring into the camera before saying, “I’m sorry, could you repeat that? We seem to be having some issues with the mic.” Blitzer, citing “technical difficulties,” began to tap on his earpiece before removing it entirely to inspect it. He began to blow on the earpiece, presumably to remove dust or hardened ear wax, as the segment cut to an unusually long commercial break.  In addition to the Boeing 777 commercial airliner, Pinal County’s Narcotics Task Force also discovered a black BMW 328i sedan parked in the warehouse. The vehicle was found to be registered to CNN anchor Don Lemon. Authorities said the car was empty except for a spent tear gas canister stamped “Ferguson Police Department” which was found under the passenger seat.  In a statement released by his publicist, Don Lemon said he’s “never even been to Arizona” and accused the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office of racial profiling. Lemon, who drives a Toyota Prius, went on to say he “wouldn’t be caught dead in a vehicle reminiscent of the Third Reich.”  Early Wednesday morning sheriff’s deputies arrested CNN’s Anderson Cooper as he attempted to gain access to the warehouse which has been sealed off by law enforcement pending an investigation. Deputies say Cooper arrived at the scene via helicopter at approximately 7:15 a.m. Rather than land, Cooper, who was wearing a bulletproof Press vest and wrap-around sunglasses, rappelled to the ground from the hovering helicopter. Deputies brought Cooper down with a Taser after he attempted to place a breaching charge on a door leading into the warehouse. He later told investigators he was there to “set the record straight.”  On August 2 a piece of wreckage belonging to a Boeing 777, the same type of aircraft as MH370, washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean. The object was sent to France for further analysis but Malaysian authorities are confident the “wreckage” belongs to the missing MH370."
E140,1,Watch: Syrian refugees in Germany complain about slow internet speeds,"Watch: Syrian refugees in Germany complain about slow internet speeds  There is an ironic phrase much in fashion these days, used to trivialize problems that people complain about. Just call it a “white people problem,” or its variant, “first world problem.” Things like slow internet, expensive pro sports tickets, or any of the other things that bother what Hillary Clinton calls “everyday people.” Which makes it passing strange that these so-called “Syrian refugees” interviewed by Russia’s RT television complain about slow internet speeds, not having enough money to buy cigarettes, and food that’s fit only for a dog or a woman.  Of course, the Koran teaches that Muslims are entitled to the fruit of infidels’ labors simply because they are Muslims. So maybe these complaints are quite justifiable in their minds.

pheme_203,1,GERMAN NEWS REPORT: Co-Pilot of Germanwings Airbus Was MUSLIM CONVERT …’Hero of Islamic State’?,"GERMAN REPORT —HE WAS RADICALIZED!  Police have reportedly found an “item of significance” at the apartment of the co-pilot who crashed the Germanwing passenger plane into the Alps this week.  The item was NOT a suicide note.    28-year-old German Andreas Lubitz trained in the Phoenix, Arizona and is pictured here in San Francisco.  A German news website claims Andreas Lubitz was a Muslim convert.  Speisa.com reported:  According to Michael Mannheimer, a writer for German PI-News, Germany now has its own 9/11, thanks to the convert to Islam, Andreas Lubitz.  Translation from German:  All evidence indicates that the copilot of Airbus machine in his six-months break during his training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and subsequently either by the order of “radical”, ie. devout Muslims , or received the order from the book of terror, the Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of the investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that he – as Mohammed Atta, in the attack against New York – received his instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.  Converts are the most important weapon of Islam. Because their resume do not suggests that they often are particularly violent Muslims. Thus Germany now has its own 9/11, but in a reduced form. And so it is clear that Islam is a terrorist organization that are in accordance with §129a of the Criminal Code to prohibit it and to investigate its followers. But nothing will happen. One can bet that the apologists (media, politics, “Islamic Scholars”) will agree to assign this an act of a “mentally unstable” man, and you can bet that now, once again the mantra of how supposedly peaceful Islam is will continue. And worse still, the attacks by the left against those who have always warned against Islam, will be angrier and merciless.  For now the German Islam supporters like never before have their backs against the wall.  Michael Mannheimer, 26.3.2015"

OpParisIntel, an Anonymous affiliate, released a list showing eight ISIS targets:  WWE Survivor Series at Philips Arena (Atlanta, GA)  Demonstration by Collectif du droit des femmes (Paris)  Cigales Electroniques with Vocodecks, RE-Play & Rawtor at Le Bizen (Paris)  Concrete Invites Drumcode: Adam Beyer, Alan Fitzpatrick, Joel Mull at Concrete (Paris)  Feast of Christ the King celebrations (Rome/Worldwide)  Al-Jihad, One Day Juz (Indonesia)  Five Finger Death Punch (Milan)  University Pastoral Day (Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Lebanon)  The attacks include three cites in Paris, which was rocked last week by six different attacks throughout the city. ISIS also targeted Lebanon, which was also attacked last week, Indonesia, Rome, and Milan.  https://twitter.com/OpParisIntel/status/668051246796963841  According to WSB-TV in Atlanta, the FBI is taking the threat to the WWE event very seriously.  Anonymous turned their attention away from giant corporations and the American government last week and declared war on ISIS, quickly shutting down many ISIS social media accounts and message boards. The Islamic State responded to the hacker group, and threatened to retaliate. However, due to Anonymous’s loosely structured nature, an attack against the group would be difficult to organize.  The FBI released the following statement to WSB-TV:  “The FBI is aware of reports of an alleged threat that includes an Atlanta, Georgia venue and event. While we take all threats seriously, we do not have specific or credible information of an attack at this time. We have, however, made the proper notifications as we continue to work closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to keep our community safe.”  UPDATE 11/21/2015: Here is the WWE’s official response to this rumored ISIS threat: “WWE Survivor Series is currently scheduled as planned while we investigate the matter with federal, state and local authorities.”  UPDATE 11/22/2015: Read our latest update to this story here.

""Prince will not be performing at [Massey Hall] tonight,"" the concert promoter tweeted shortly before 3 p.m., news that dampened the spirits of thousands of fans who had waited in line for hours, in the rain.  It all started early Tuesday when 3rdEyeGirl — Prince's all-female live band — tweeted this cryptic message: ""4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…"".  Donna Grantis, far left, a Toronto native very well respected throughout the city's blues and rock scenes, plays in 3rdEyeGirl, who are currently touring with Prince. (Handout/Canadian Press)  The tweet was deleted shortly after 8:30 a.m., but it sent shock waves through Toronto-area Prince fans. The veteran musician played surprise gigs in Europe earlier this year, and once called Toronto home.  Fans were convinced. But after Live Nation made its announcement, they were left wondering what had happened.  ""Maybe he's just got a flat tire somewhere, who knows?"" said one.  ""We can't really blame anybody because all of this is based on speculation,"" said another.  Band apologizes  Members of 3rdEyeGirl tweeted apologies later that evening.  ""For all those who waited in line, I apologize for any disappointment caused by the confusion,"" tweeted guitar player Donna Grantis, a well-known Toronto blues player with musical connections throughout the city.  Drummer Hannah Welton added the day's events were ""a total mix up"" and that, ""there was never a show confirmed.""  CBC News was unable to confirm what was going on, but a CBC cameraman at Massey Hall said a drum kit emblazoned with Prince's famous symbol was being set up on stage. The cameraman and a CBC reporter were then asked to leave the venue.  A news release issued by 3rdEyeGirl added that its equipment had been set up ""to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances.""  One Prince fan who heard about the show on Twitter told CBC he's waiting because he's ""loved Prince for 25 years.""  ""His career spans so many different grooves and styles. I love all of it,"" said the fan, who identified himself only as Tom.  On Saturday, Prince and 3rdEyeGirl played a much-applauded, extended seven-minute set on Saturday Night Live.  Prince himself lived in Toronto for several years in the early 2000s while he was married to Toronto native Manuela Testolini. The pair divorced in 2006."
E410,1,Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians They Hit,"In April a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China’s Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl’s grandmother shouted, “Stop! You’ve hit a child!” the BMW’s driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: “Don’t say that I was driving the car,” she said. “Say it was my husband. We can give you money.”  Advertisement  It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true, it’s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: “It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.”  Advertisement  Advertisement  This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat’s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother’s body. He then speeds away from her corpse.  Advertisement  Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao’s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for “negligence.” Zhao’s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, “You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one.”  “Double-hit cases” have been around for decades. I first heard of the “hit-to-kill” phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near-miss of a motorcyclist, he said, “If I hit someone, I’ll hit him again and make sure he’s dead.” Enjoying my shock, he explained that in Taiwan, if you cripple a man, you pay for the injured person’s care for a lifetime. But if you kill the person, you “only have to pay once, like a burial fee.” He insisted he was serious—and that this was common.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Most people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation. In China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small—amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000—and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions. The Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $400,000 for the first 23 years of his care. Drivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical. Indeed, Zhao Xiao Cheng—the man caught on a security camera video driving over a grandmother five times—ended up paying only about $70,000 in compensation.  Advertisement  In 2010 in Xinyi, video captured a wealthy young man reversing his BMW X6 out of a parking spot. He hits a 3-year-old boy, knocking the child to the ground and rolling over his skull. The driver then shifts his BMW into drive and crushes the child again. Remarkably, the driver then gets out of the BMW, puts the vehicle in reverse, and guides it with his hand as he walks the vehicle backward over the boy’s crumpled body. The man’s foot is so close to the toddler’s head that, if alive, the boy could have reached out and touched him. The driver then puts the BMW in drive again, running over the boy one last time as he drives away.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Here too, the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person’s death. (He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag.) Police rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime, ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy’s head as he sped away.  These drivers are willing to kill not only because it is cheaper, but also because they expect to escape murder charges. In the days before video cameras became widespread, it was rare to have evidence that a driver hit the victim twice. Even in today’s age of cellphone cameras, drivers seem confident that they can either bribe local officials or hire a lawyer to evade murder charges.  Advertisement  Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn’t injure the victim seriously, and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway. In Sichuan province, an enormous, dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy. The toddler was only dazed by the initial blow, and immediately climbed to his feet. Eyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella, which had been thrown across the street by the impact, when the truck reversed and crushed him, this time killing him.  Advertisement  Despite the eyewitness testimony, the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed, never hit the boy a second time, and that the wheels never rolled over the child. Meanwhile, one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child’s body under the truck’s front wheel.  Advertisement  In each of these cases, despite video and photographs showing that the driver hit the victim a second, and often even a third, fourth, and fifth time, the drivers ended up paying the same or less in compensation and jail time than they would have if they had merely injured the victim.  With so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment, the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands. In 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice. (A television report claims the crowd had acted on “false rumors.” However, at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time.)  Advertisement  Of course, not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment. A man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead—even stabbing the injured woman with a knife—was convicted and executed. In 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases. Taiwan’s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code, which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others (such as a person killed in a traffic accident). Meanwhile, China’s legislature has emphasized that multiple-hit cases should be treated as murders. Yet even when a driver hits a victim multiple times, it can be hard to prove intent and causation—at least to the satisfaction of China’s courts. Judges, police, and media often seem to accept rather unbelievable claims that the drivers hit the victims multiple times accidentally, or that the drivers confused the victims with inanimate objects.  Advertisement  Hit-to-kill cases continue, and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment. In January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow. In April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child.  And last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW—and then offered to bribe the family—was brought to court. She claimed the killing was an accident. Prosecutors accepted her assertion, and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison.  This light sentence would still be more of a punishment than many drivers have received for similar crimes. But it probably won’t be enough to keep the next driver from putting his car in reverse and hitting the gas."

pheme_68,1,A FRAIL BREZHNEV AT MAY DAY PARADE,"Analysts looking for clues to the pecking order and, in view of Mr. Brezhnev's health, for signs to his likely successor, found little to go on. Mr. Brezhnev was flanked atop the mausoleum by Prime Minister Nikolai A. Tikhonov to the right and, to the left, by Viktor V. Grishin, head of the Moscow party committee, but the positioning seemed dictated by their functions. As Moscow party leader, Mr. Grishin was the nominal host for the occasion.  Next in the line-up, equally positioned to either side of Mr. Brezhnev, were Mr. Kirilenko and Konstantin U. Chernenko, a 70-yearold Brezhnev loyalist who has emerged as a contender for the top party post. But the significance was cast in doubt by the placing of Yuri V. Andropov, the 67-year-old head of the State Security Committee, whose positioning relative to Mr. Brezhnev would have put him ninth in the hierarchy, after Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, who is generally not considered to be a contender for power.  Mr. Andropov's stature appeared to have been enhanced by the Lenin birthday rally, at which he made the keynote speech. Although the task has rotated among Politburo members, the fact that he was designated this year, and made a tough ideological address, was taken as a sign that he is bidding for the post of top party ideologist, vacant since Mikhail A. Suslov died in January at the age of 79.  A clearer indication on such matters could come from a high-level party meeting that some reports have forecast for later this month.If Mr. Andropov is shifted to Mr. Suslov's post of national party secretary for ideology, with which his state security role has kept him in close touch, Mr. Andropov might gain an institutional base from which to seek the leadership and distance himself from the state security apparatus, whose reputation could be a liability for a competitor in the leadership struggle.  The May Day parade itself, as usual, was a testament to Soviet distrust of spontaneity. While television viewers watched serried ranks of workers, athletes and children cheering the leadership and shouting ''Hurrah'' to taped exhortations from loudspeakers atop the Kremlin's crenellated walls, an official in a brown corduroy suit stood on a lower level of the mausoleum - out of the camera's eye, but visible from a spectators' enclosure nearby - commanding each enthusiastic moment."

Earlier, police had chased a vehicle at high speed along the nearby A2 motorway towards Paris as authorities appeared to be closing in on the two brothers. Gunshots rang out and police trucks, ambulances and armored vehicles descended on the area close to Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport.  Police and anti-terrorist forces blocked all entries to the town of about 8,000, clearly seeking to limit the scale of any siege.  ""All residents are requested to remain at home. Children are to be kept safe in school,” the municipal website said.  The danger of hostage taking or of a second attack has been a central concern of security services since the gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, killing ten journalists and two police officers.  Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told iTELE television he was fairly sure the two suspects were in the building currently surrounded.  ""We are almost certain it is those two individuals holed up in that building.""  Yohann Bardoux, a plumber whose office is two doors down from the printing shop where the hostage drama is taking place stayed away from work after hearing gunfire. But he said his mother was in the building next door to the printing shop.  ""Of course I'm worried about her, I hope it all comes down soon, and turns out well,"" Bardoux said.  ""They are everywhere. It's really jumping. They've blocked the whole zones, we've got helicopters overhead, the police presence is impressive.""  A senior Yemeni intelligence source told Reuters one of the two suspects, French-born sons of Algerian-born parents, was in Yemen for several months in 2011 for religious studies; but there was no confirmed information whether he was trained by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  The gunmen shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) as they carried out the attack, which has been described by President Francois Holland and other world leaders as an attack on the fundaments of democracy.  The weekly newspaper appears to have been targeted because of its lampooning of Islam and cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.  The fugitive suspects are both in their early 30s, and were already under police surveillance. One was jailed for 18 months for trying to travel to Iraq a decade ago to fight as part of an Islamist cell. Police said they were ""armed and dangerous"".  U.S. and European sources close to the investigation said on Thursday that one of the brothers, Said Kouachi, was in Yemen in 2011 for several months training with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the group's most active affiliates.  A Yemeni official familiar with the matter said the Yemen government was aware of the possibility of a connection between Said Kouachi and AQAP, and was looking into any possible links.  U.S. government sources said Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif Kouachi were listed in two U.S. security databases, a highly classified database containing information on 1.2 million possible counter-terrorism suspects, called TIDE, and the much smaller ""no fly"" list maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center, an interagency unit.  U.S. television network ABC reported that the brothers had been listed in the databases for ""years.""  (Additional reporting by Paris and U.S. bureaus; Editing by Mark John and Ralph Boulton)"
E301,1,Ben Carson is the most brainless brain surgeon in America says PIERS MORGAN,"Dr Ben Carson is a brain surgeon.  In fact, he’s one of America’s top neuro-surgical specialists; a man who made history when he became the first surgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head.  He specializes in pediatric neurosurgery. This is an area I’m familiar with because one of my cousins was a pediatric neurologist for many years at the world famous Great Ormond Street hospital in London.  You don’t get to specialize in the medical science of children’s brains unless you’re incredibly skilled at your job.  My cousin’s highly intelligent and has helped save many young lives.  Dr Carson, I must therefore presume, is also highly intelligent and has also helped save many young lives.  When Ben Carson first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon. It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington. But then he started speaking  So why does he persist in making public statements that make him sound like the most brainless berk in America?  When he first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon.  It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington.  But then he started speaking.  He compared homosexuals to bestiality and announced that being homosexual was ‘absolutely’ a choice, explaining: ‘A lot of people go into prison straight and when they come out, they’re gay.’  He followed this by saying that Obamacare, a policy established to bring 30 million uninsured poor people into healthcare, was ‘the worst thing to happen to the nation since slavery’, adding: ‘And it is slavery in a way.’  His next pronouncement was that America is now ‘very much like Nazi Germany’ and the Obama administration acts ‘like the Gestapo’.  Yes, he compared this government to one that committed the Holocaust.  More recently, he declared that no Muslim could ever become president, despite the U.S. constitution making it very clear that ‘no religious Test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in the United States.’  By now I was fairly convinced that Dr Carson was a nasty little bigot.  What I didn’t expect him to be was stupid, or a man lacking in principle even if I didn’t agree with those principles.  But then came the issue of guns.  In 2013, Glenn Beck asked Dr Carson if people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons.  He replied: ‘I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people and the semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it.’  I cheered this sensible view from what seemed to be a very sensible man.  But reaction from the hard-right gun lobby was fast and furious.  Ben Carson really went crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well. Pictured: Gunman Chris Harper-Mercer  Conservative commentator Dana Loesch said ‘a lot’ of people like Dr Carson but ‘his belief of restriction of gun rights is a deal-killer’.  The irony of course being that his call for a restriction of military assault rifles for civilians would actually stop less things being killed.  Since the mass school shooting in Oregon, though, Dr Carson’s had a re-think about guns.  Or more of a cowardly U-turn for pure political expediency.  ‘Guns don’t kill people,’ he told Fox & Friends yesterday, with a straight face.  Later, he stopped by The View and said he’d like kindergarten teachers to be armed.  Then, asked by Fox News if he’d go the scene of the Oregon shooting as President Obama is doing, he replied: ‘I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I’d go to the next one.’  Finally, he went really bats**t crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well.  The clear message being that the students who died had somehow failed to show his kind of Rambo strength of character in their moment of horrendous terror.  But victim-blaming wasn’t even Dr Carson’s most hideous statement on guns in the last 48 hours.  In a Facebook posting on Monday night, he said this: ‘As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.’  WHAT?  I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it)  One of America’s leading surgeons believes no bullet-ridden body of a fellow American can ever be worse than gun control measures designed to stop the shooting happening in the first place?  I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it).  Then I want to hear him tell the parents of those kids that their annihilation wasn’t as devastating as him having to give up guns.  He wouldn’t have the courage to say it to their faces, of course.  In fact, Dr Carson seems a particularly gutless individual generally for one with such an eminent resumé.  A man who loves to bill himself as a charming, respectable, humble, smart brain surgeon. But who in reality is an unpleasant, arrogant, sneering piece of work pandering to the very worst elements of the far-right GOP membership, and prepared to chop and change his views on a whim to secure their support.  My neurologist cousin is a man of great kindness, sensitivity and genuine humility.  The staggering thing about Dr Carson is that he can, by all accounts, show all these qualities in a surgery room.  But when running for president he prefers to be casually vicious, prejudiced and callous.  The most dangerous people in politics are often the most intelligent.  They know best how to manipulate the masses, and to get what they want.  An America run by Dr Carson would be a shameful place.  One where intolerance is king and death is inconsequential."

View gallery A hostage runs out of a cafe in the central business district of Sydney on December 16, 2014 (AFP Ph …  14:45 GMT - Gunman's sectarian riddle - The gunman has not yet been officially confirmed as Man Haron Monis, but if it is him, it does solve a riddle some analysts were pondering -- why was an apparently Sunni militant wearing a Shiite-inspired religious headband?  Monis was born in Shiite-majority Iran, but has since converted to Sunni Islam.  14:29 GMT - Monis accusations - Man Haron Monis says the crimes he has been accused of in the past are attempts to smear him.  ""These cases are in fact political cases against this Muslim activist, not real criminal cases.""  14:25 GMT - More on Monis - On his website, self-styled Sheikh Haron, also known as Man Haron Monis, says his children have been ""taken away by the Australian government"" and that he is not allowed to contact them.  He also says the Australian government accused him of being an accessory to murder in 2013 and of ""sexually and indecently"" assaulting women in 2002.  14:12 GMT - Former Shiite - It appears the Iranian-born gunman has converted from Shiism to Sunni Islam. Islamic State and other jihadist groups consider Shiites heretics, or rejectionists -- ""rafidi"" -- of true Islam.  ""I used to be a Rafidi, but not anymore. Now I am a Muslim, Alhamdu Lillah,"" he says on his website.  - About Monis -  14:02 GMT - 'Sheikh Haron' - The self-styled sheikh has his own Wikipedia entry, which links to a website sheikhharon.com.

New South Wales police have not yet commented publicly on the gunman's identity.  13:48 GMT - AUSTRALIA MEDIA IDENTIFY SYDNEY GUNMAN AS IRANIAN NAMED ""MONIS"" -  - Gunman identified -  13:39 GMT - Sleepless - ""There's been movement at the cafe, the gunman moving a hostage past the window, two more hostages change positions. Not much sleep in there,"" tweets 7News journalist Chris Reason at the scene.  13:27 GMT - The scene - About 100 people are standing along the police cordon in Martin Place, about 80 metres from the cafe, AFP reporter Glenda Kwek writes.  Many are Sydneysiders who were evacuated from their offices or just moving around the city, and stopped to have a look at the scene for an hour or so.  There's plenty of local and international media, perhaps 30, 40 or more at different spots of the city, though it's not quite a circus as everyone's very orderly and pretty supportive of each other.  13:06 GMT - Video message - At least two separate videos showed a single hostage -- different in each recording -- standing in a corner of the cafe.  Behind them was a black flag featuring the Shahada -- or Islamic creed -- in Arabic script, held aloft by an unseen person.  A poster for Lindt chocolate products could be seen in the corner of the shot.  13:00 GMT - Hostage videos - Videos have emerged online in the last half hour or so of tired-looking hostages repeating the hostage taker's demands.  Video hosting site YouTube has since taken the footage offline.  12:22 GMT - Hostage-taker end game? - After a more than 11-hour siege, experts say the hostage-taker will be exhausted, but are concerned about his plans given he has no apparent exit plan.  The one hostage-taker seen so far has shown his face to the media and has apparently not made any demands that would allow his escape.  Islamic State and other jihadist groups glorify martyrdom as a way of ensuring entry to paradise.  11:36 GMT - Selfie backlash - Several pictures have emerged online of beaming people apparently taking photos of themselves near the Lindt Cafe, where a hostage crisis is unfolding, triggering condemnation from some commentators.  Several news outlets have collated the selfie snaps and responses to them.  View gallery Hostages run out of a cafe where a gunman had taken hostages in the central business district of Syd …  ""Selfie disgrace, how can people pose for pictures at scene of Sydney terror siege?"" tweeted former Sunday Times columnist Jani Allan.  - Selfies -  11:03 GMT - Uber under fire - San Francisco-based taxi service app Uber has come under fire for upping its prices in central Sydney during the hostage crisis, triggering outrage online and the hashtag #ubershame.

He also said Australian Muslims are angry and condemn the hostage-taker's actions.  10:43 GMT - Long haul? - The lights at the Lindt Cafe have been off for several hours as police signal they are preparing for the long haul as 10:00 pm approaches in the now 11-hour hostage crisis.  Police are urging commuters to come into the city as normal.  10:37 GMT - Flag meaning - The flag held up at the Lindt Cafe features the Shahada in Arabic script. The Shahada is the Islamic creed stating God is one and that Mohammed is his Prophet.  10:26 GMT - Hostage-taker's demands - Hostages in the Lindt Cafe have reportedly been posting the hostage-taker's demands on social media.  The posts could not be verified independently, and New South Wales police have asked media not to publicise the demands.  However, it has been widely reported that the hostage-taker had requested a black flag used by the Islamic State jihadist group.  - Demands? -  10:07 GMT - Situation recap - Police have made clear they are in touch with a hostage-taker, and have confirmed that they are only dealing with one site at which hostages have been taken.  Five hostages are now free, none has been injured, and the hostage-taker is apparently rotating them around the cafe in central Sydney, keeping them near windows in an effort to deter police marksmen.  A black flag with Arabic script has been raised at one window. However, police have not confirmed the hostage-taker's demands, the number of attackers, or how many hostages remain.  10:02 GMT - Infosys hostage - Indian tech giant Infosys reportedly confirms one of its employees is being held hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney, in a statment carried by several news outlets but not on the company's website.  ""We can confirm that one Infosys employee is among the hostages at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. We are also in the process of confirming the whereabouts of all our other employees in the city. We are in constant touch with the local authorities and Indian consulate in Sydney for updates on the situation on the ground.""  09:53 GMT - Not a pro - Analysts say the hostage-taker's plan does not seem to have been well-executed or well thought-out, indicating a self-starter, or lone wolf, attack rather than a sophisticated plan.  An example is the fact that the wrong flag was brought to the scene. The black flag with Arabic script raised at the Lindt cafe window is not the one used by the Islamic State jihadist group.  09:52 GMT - Australian Muslims condemn siege - More than 40 Australian Muslim groups jointly condemn a siege at a Sydney cafe in which hostages were taken and an Islamic flag was displayed.  ""We reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being or to instil fear and terror into their hearts,"" they said in a statement, adding that it was a ""despicable act"".  09:40 GMT - Australians stand with Muslims - The hashtag #illridewithyou starts to trend, as Australians on Twitter offer to travel with Muslims fearing reprisals.

""There's no place on earth that does not have access to social media... accordingly we're building our plans around that.""  - Social media -  09:30 GMT - No reprisals - New South Wales Police Commissoner Andrew Scipione says police are guarding against reprisal attacks on Muslim communities and mosques, and are working with confidence-building groups and religious leaders.  ""Clearly reprisal attacks should not happen,"" he said.

They do not want to speculate on motive, the number of hostage takers or tactics.  09:21 GMT - Hostage-taker image - The website of The Australian newspaper has published a photo of a purported hostage taker holding one of the hostages.

The priority is the safety of all involved.""  08:12 GMT - 'Free, open, generous' - In a statement Abbott says it is ""profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.  ""Nevertheless, I can say that New South Wales Police and other agencies have responded to this incident with great professionalism,"" he says.  ""You can be proud of the way your police and security bodies have responded to the events of this day,"" he adds.  “I think I can also commend the people of Sydney for the calmness with which they have reacted to this disturbing incident.  “We are a free, open and generous people and today we have responded to this in character.""  08:10 GMT - Testing day: PM - Prime Minister Tony Abbott tweets: ""It’s been a difficult day, which has tested us, but like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge.

E114,1,"No, Target Is Not Giving You A 50% Off Everything Coupon For Liking A Page On Facebook","No, Target Is Not Giving You A 50% Off Everything Coupon For Liking A Page On Facebook  We all want to believe that there are special coupons out there just waiting to be grabbed, and the newest questionable offer to take hold of Facebook newsfeeds involves the false promise of a coupon that will magically grant you 50% off anything at Target.  As you can see above, folks are sharing a link from a site called grab-coupons.com, with an image of this supposed coupon offering half off your Target purchase through the end of the year with no exceptions and very few qualifications.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is. A rep for Target HQ confirms to Consumerist that there is no such coupon and this is a fake.  So why the trickery?  Clicking on the link takes you out of Facebook to a page with instructions on how to “Get Your Target Reward!”  Given the spare design, the fact that it’s not a Target site and that all you supposedly have to do is like something on Facebook, you should be suspicious.  Missing from that second screengrab is a third step — hitting a heavily pixelated “Like” button, which doesn’t actually “like” anything on Facebook, but takes you to… a site where you supposedly get rewarded for taking surveys:    But it’s not as simple as taking a survey. The only way to actually get the Target gift card (which is decidedly not the same as a 50% off coupon), is to complete the “purchase requirement,” which is detailed in microprint below:    So you have to register (10 points), respond to the survey (20 points), review “optional offers” (30 points), and then buy at least one of those special offers, which “usually requires a purchase or entering into a paid subscription program for goods or services.”  And there we have it. All that work to get you to sign up to some sort of subscription service (best of luck trying to cancel it), to maybe receive a gift card from a third-party company you’ve never heard of, for a promotion that Target denies exists.  In short, please stop perpetuating these sketchy sites on Facebook. It annoys your friends who know better and only confuses things for people who think they might be getting a good deal.

E278,1,Dumb Satire of Yelp South Park Lawsuit Rises (Briefly) to Top of Google News,"Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us.  Late on Tuesday night, an article took off online claiming Yelp was suing South Park, the long-running Comedy Central cartoon, for $10 million because of how the company was depicted in an episode.  That is not true. The article comes from the URL NBC.com.co, which is not the website of NBC. The spoof site has an Australian address and reports it is “proudly owned by NBC President & CEO Dr. Paul Horner,” who was also listed as the Yelp spokesman in the article. He is not. He is also not Steve Burke, the actual chief executive of NBC.*  The satire fooled several people. It also, apparently, fooled Google’s news results — at least temporarily. If you typed “South Park” or “Yelp South Park” in Google News this morning, the article popped to the top, attributed to NBC.  Now, the top News result is a debunking of the article from Eater, one of our sister sites. (Clever move, Google.)  On the Google News blog, the search company notes that it will occasionally tag satirical articles as such “so you’ll know that you’re reading a satirical article.” Google and Yelp have a very lengthy history of animosity, although we very much doubt the move was intentional on Google’s part.  Last night, Yelp pinned this tweet on its Twitter page. And a spokeswoman passed along this statement: “We have no interest in legal action against the fantastic team that makes the South Park magic happen.”  https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/656627875110457345  We asked Google for comment and will update if they do. It’s likely they’ll come back with some variation of this disclaimer, which rests at the bottom of all Google News search results: “The selection and placement of stories on this page were determined automatically by a computer program.”  Update: An earlier version of this article incorrectly named Jeff Zucker as the NBC chief executive, not Steve Burke.  * Disclosure: NBCU is an investor in Vox Media, which owns Re/code."

Social media users have warned under the hashtag '100Days100Nights' that between Western and Normandie Avenues, innocent people could be risking their lives during the 100 days, according to The Daily Beast.  The terrifying bet was allegedly made last week following the death of Rollin 100 gang member 'KP'.  The posts on Instagram and Twitter have been taken seriously by police and led LAPD officials to deploy more officers to the area, police sources told the Daily Beast.  Scroll down for video  Two Los Angeles gangs have entered into a contest betting on who can kill 100 people in 100 days first (above a woman posts on Instagram about the #100Days100Nights bet)  The terrifying bet was announced reportedly made last week following the death of Rollin 100 gang member 'KP' (pictured left). The posts on Instagram and Twitter have been taken seriously by police leading to LAPD officials deploying more officers to the area (a Pray For LA message shown right)  On Saturday night, police from LAPD's 77th Division issued a tactical alert - spanning from Vernon Avenue to Manchester Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard to Figueroa and San Pedro streets - following the string of gang shootings that occurred over five hours  A rise in violent crimes occurred over the weekend as one man was shot dead and 12 were wounded after more than six shootings in the 77th Street district - which has some of the city's most violent neighborhoods, the Los Angeles Times reported.  On Thursday night, a woman and two young boys aged four and 11, were wounded after the gunman, who is still at large, approached their car and opened fire on the 2000 block of West 99th Street.  Anthony Alonzo Cudger, 47, was shot and killed on Saturday after a suspect drove to his car and opened a round of fire at the intersection of 81st and Hoover streets before leaving the scene, according to the Daily Beast.  Police are still investigating a motive, however sources believe that an argument that occurred at a gang member's funeral had to do with it.  Gang members said between Western and Normandie Avenues in South Los Angeles (shown above) no one would be safe during the 100 days  A rise in violent crimes occurred over the weekend as one man was shot dead and 12 were wounded after more than six shootings in the 77th Street district - which has some of the city's most violent neighborhoods (above someone posts on social media regarding the bet)  Less than an hour following that shooting, a man in his 40s was shot while in his car at the intersection of 75th and Figueroa Streets - only seven blocks away. The man was able to drive to the hospital but the suspect is still at large.  A man in his 20s was found by authorities shot in the stomach at Hyde Park Boulevard and Brynhurst Avenue and was rushed to the hospital.  Less than four miles away and around half an hour later, one woman and two men were shot while walking down 47th Street and Budlong Avenue. They were all taken to hospital, where one is in critical condition.  On Saturday night, police from LAPD's 77th Division issued a tactical alert - spanning from Vernon Avenue to Manchester Boulevard and Crenshaw Boulevard to Figueroa and San Pedro streets - following the string of gang shootings that occurred over five hours, according to ABC7.  No shootings were reported in the 77th district on Sunday, LAPD Deputy Chief Bill Scott said.

Scott met with gang intervention workers on Monday asking them to help calm fears and told them there was not evidence to confirm the threats, according to the Los Angeles Times.  He said: 'You've got everyday folks who have nothing to do with the gang lifestyle and culture scared.'  One of KP's family members said that while the full-time single father was loosely-affiliated with a gang he did not participate in gang-related activities.  The family member also said he had turned his life around after the birth of his child and was hoping for a better life for him and his son.  'It's making him look like a bad person. It's not like he started this and got killed behind it. He had no control over what's going on with #100Days100Nights,' the family member, who wanted to remain anonymous, told The Daily Beast."
E184,1,Elderly Woman Arrested For Making Purses Out Of Neighbors “Missing” Cats,"News 8 – A gruesome story coming out of Grand Haven, Michigan has residents at this small town shocked and disturbed. Marjorie Reynolds, 91, was described as a quiet elderly women who waved at strangers and neighbors as they walked by. But Reynolds had a more sinister nature, as neighbors are learning, after 19 missing neighborhood cats were found dead in her home. Not just dead, however, but skinned and cured – with some of them made into purses.  Yes, purses. Reynolds explained to authorities in her recorded confession that she had taken up a hobby of “arts and crafts.” Reynolds said the neighborhood cats would come to her all the time so she would feed them. But it was when one of the neighborhood cats died, that she brought it into the house and decided to “not have it go to waste.”  “She said the first handbag turned out so beautiful, that she kind of got hooked on it,” said Detective John Williams of the Grand Haven, Michigan Police Department. “She is still denying that she killed any of the cats, just that they just all ‘mysteriously died’. But were having trouble believing her, 19 cats is a whole lot of dead cats.” Reynolds reportedly has a history of dementia and family members are saying that her mental issues definitely played a role. Reynolds is currently being held in the Haven Senior Center under mental evaluation. Click Here to LIKE us on FACEBOOK"
E530,1,Hickory (NC) Walmart Human Trafficking Warning,"On 4 August 2015, a Facebook user published a claim that she and her daughter had encountered kidnappers working on behalf of human traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Hickory, North Carolina:  My daughter saved my life today! My daughter, Amanda […], and I were at Wal Mart in hickory earlier and were walking back to the car when we were approached by a young, nice looking man in a gray suit by a big white van with two ladders on top. He was handing out gift bags of make up samples. As we walked by, he came up to us and said, “Just in time!” And, while following us to the car, kept insisting that we take the gift bags. You could see the fear in Mandy’s face while I had no clue what was going on other than a persistent salesman trying to make some sort of deal. Mandy read about men going around giving out free samples of different things to women only and then after they accept them, they are kidnapped and then sold into the sex slave trade. Apparently, women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam. She repeatedly refused him while I was dazed and confused as to what was going on. She finally demanded that I get in the car, then explained everything. If I had been alone, I would be on my way to God knows where right now. If this happens to any of you ladies, RUN! Go back in the store and tell somebody! And don’t go to WalMart or any other store alone if you don’t have to! Thank you, Jesus for giving me a daughter that’s smarter than I am and for watching out for both of us. P.S. A few of you have shared this post and I want to say thank you so much! I encourage everybody who reads this to PLEASE share this post and get the word out! You could be saving a life!  The claim bore many similarities to a rash of similar rumors shared by social media users that summer. In May 2015, a separate Facebook user claimed she was scouted in a similar fashion at an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store; in June, Twitter was awash in warnings of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews; later that month the theme park abduction urban legend recirculated; and simultaneously, a terrifying tale of purported drug-dispensing teenaged assailants in the bathroom of a Denton, Texas, Dillards department store made the same rounds.  As with some of the near-subsequent rumors, the Hickory Walmart sex trafficking claim resembled a few long-circulating urban legends. The use of a desirable gift to “soften” potential victims to the abductor’s approach echoed an enduring (but false) story about carjackers utilizing $100 bills as bait to lure victims. It was also similar to widely-circulated (and old) rumors about ill-intentioned folks trawling parking lots with drugged perfume samples.  Finally, the claim wasn’t dissimilar to the more recent Hobby Lobby abduction rumor in as much as it was quite likely based (at least in part) on a real-life event, and the poster’s account was not implausible as unwelcome solicitations involving pesky salespeople indeed occur from time to time in busy parking lots. But nothing the woman wrote definitively pointed to (or even hinted) at anything more interesting than an unwanted sales pitch. The claim that “men [are] going around giving out free samples of different things to women only and then after they accept them, they are kidnapped and then sold into the sex slave trade” wasn’t a very logical one, as nothing prevents a potential kidnapper from abducting a victim who refused the offer of a gift bag (and acceptance of a bag of makeup doesn’t make anyone easier to kidnap). The assertion “women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam” is unsupported by news reports (and inaccurate, given that the scenario described constitutes a serious crime and not a “scam”).  A search for incidents that matched the above account in Hickory yielded some unrelated results of note, albeit none substantiating rumors of human trafficking activity. On 6 August 2015 (after the status update above was shared, not before) the Hickory Daily Record published an article about “meth trafficking” in the parking lot of a local Walmart. Chronological aspects aside, the article specifically described drug (and not human) trafficking and did not reference any sort of sex-related crime.  A separate article titled “Human trafficking rampant in NC?” was published in the same paper on 29 June 2015. Although that article made no specific mention of incidents in or around Hickory, it might have inspired fears (and subsequent “sightings”) of sex ring operators among residents. It isn’t uncommon for more upsetting elements of a newspaper article to make an impression upon readers while general details fade more quickly, and the article in question described victims initially consenting (under somewhat different and invariably coerced circumstances) to go with an abductor or abuser:  “Slavery is not a new problem, but the fact that predators can find and groom victims through the internet heightens the danger to our children and grandchildren. Before, traffickers would need to wander the streets looking for runaways, but now they can spend their days on Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat looking for vulnerable young people,” [author Kimberly] Rea said, adding that many victims go with their traffickers willingly. “We often think of trafficking in terms of people being abducted, but one study showed that only accounted for 11 percent of the trafficking cases. Over 30 percent were trafficked through offers of help (a job, money, place to live, etc.). The horrible part of that statistic was that over 50 percent of victims were trafficked by someone who pretended romantic interest.”  The newspaper passage quoted above additionally serves as a decent reminder of why inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking (often shared with a “better safe than sorry” caveat) can do more harm than good. Individuals potentially at risk of falling victim to traffickers would be better equipped with information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S., and rarely is that between strangers with no previous acquaintance in a shopping mall or chain store parking lot.  We contacted police in Hickory, North Carolina, to determine whether they’re aware of any incidents at Walmart (or elsewhere) matching the example above. According to the department, no reports of attempted abductions or unwanted solicitations in local parking lots had been received."
E206,1,Obama Orders Chicago School to Let 'Transgender' Boy Use Girls' Locker Room,"President Barack Obama’s Department of Education has ordered a suburban Chicago school to allow a boy who claims to be a girl into the girls’ locker room, whether or not the girls or their parents like it.  The federal decision about who gets to use each toilet and shower in a distant Chicago school came after a male student sued a high school in Palatine, a northwestern suburb of Chicago. The suit claims that the student’s “civil rights” were violated by a school rule which provided the two sexes their own restrooms and locker rooms.  The school offered this singular student a special area for changing clothes and using the restroom. But the boy and his lawyer instead demanded that school officials submit to his claim that he is female and so can use the girls’ facilities.  Nationwide, only about roughly 1 in 3,000 Americans have changed their names from one sex to the other sex.  On Monday, the Obama administration showed it wants to decide the issues for all schools in the nation, from Maine to New Mexico, from Deadhorse in Alaska to Pensacola in Florida.  “All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities–this is a basic civil right,” Education Department Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon insisted in a statement. “Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room.”  Obama’s agency has given the school thirty days to knuckle under to the federal mandate or risk losing the federal funding it gets from Washington.  Under pressure from activists who oppose the idea of two discrete sexes, school officials across the country have been individually creating their own policies on how to handle young people who claim to be “transgender.”  Instead of two sexes, the activists — including many gay and feminist activists — favor a government-imposed idea of “gender fluidity.” This demand would use government power to forcefully suppress the long-standing, popular, public recognition of evolved biological, social and cultural distinctions between boys and girls, and between men and women.  Conservatives says sexual differences are deeply rooted in biology and reasonable preferences, and say the gender-fluid demand would deliberately damage long-standing practices in child-rearing, education, sports, and in adult relations, and self-government by local communities.  By demanding that the Chicago area school allow the male student to use the girls facilities, Obama’s progressive officials at the Department of Education are using their financial and courtroom power to impose the policy they favor, despite the rarity of “transgender ” claims.  Just this year schools in Ohio, Missouri, and other states have recently been struck with the controversial issue.  While deciding in favor of a transgender boy and allowing him to use the girls’ facilities despite complaints by parents, a school in Ohio cited fear of constant lawsuits for its decision to allow the student to use the girls’ locker room.  But some schools are looking to go another way. Last year, for instance, a women’s college refused to allow a man posing as a woman to run for student council.

pheme_387,1,Martin Place siege: Separating fact from fiction,"Police later requested media outlets not publish this series of demands, and as such these demands have been retracted by this website. 3. Terror suspect arrested near Martin Place  Status: Busted  Around 12.30pm a photo circulated online, showing a man being arrested 200 metres away from the Lindt cafe in Martin Place. It was not immediately clear whether the arrest was related to the siege. However, NSW police were quick to put any speculation to rest, posting on Twitter that the two incidents were unrelated.  4. Airspace closed over Sydney CBD  Status: Busted  Several media outlets reported this morning that the air space over Sydney CBD had been closed due to the siege, something confirmed to this website by Sydney Airport. However Airservices Australia issued a statement saying: ""Sydney operations are continuing and Sydney airspace has not been closed."" This was confirmed by a spokesman for federal Transport Minister Warren Truss. ""There are choppers in the air and air traffic is being rerouted accordingly,"" the spokesman said.  5. Sydney Harbour Bridge closed  Status: Busted  Reports during the day suggested the Harbour Bridge had been closed as other buildings in the CBD were evacuated. This never occurred. The Cahill Expressway - one of the main routes to the Bridge - was closed, with city-bound traffic diverted to the Domain Tunnel. This decreased traffic on the Bridge, however it was still accessible to motorists using other roads, including the Pacific Highway. 6. Mobile phone reception blocked in CBD  Status: Unclear  Channel Seven reported that mobile phone services had been shut down in the CBD at the request of police.  However this claim was later refuted by the telcos, who indicated that their services had not been disrupted. Delays were being experienced. The issues may be related to congestion from people posting photos to social media using the mobile networks and making calls at the same time. NSW Police is yet to comment on whether it is using any mobile phone jamming equipment, although use of such equipment is illegal unless approved by the communications regulator. 7. Uber gouging passengers $100 to get out of CBD  Status: Busted  There were reports attacking Uber for charging passengers a minimum of $100 to get out of the CBD. However, the price is automatically set by a computer algorithm based on demand."
E328,1,Supporters of Donald Trump and other Republicans get worst grammar grades,"Donald Trump may be leading his rival Republican presidential aspirants in the polls, but, when it comes to his supporters’ facility with grammar, he’s running dead last.  And, according to the Presidential Debate Grammar Power Rankings survey — conducted by the Grammarly blog — Republican supporters, overall, trail Democratic candidates’ backers in grammar skills.  The survey methodology involved scanning the Facebook pages of the 2016 presidential candidates in search of grammatical and related writing errors, such as subject-verb disagreement. Grammarly first looked at the grammar of Republican supporters in August, followed by a parallel Democratic study that was published on Tuesday. Simultaneously, Grammarly has stacked the two parties’ adherents up against each other.  Grammarly sought to zero in on representative positive and neutral comments and then determined the number of misspellings, incorrect and absent punctuation, misused or missing words, and noun-verb issues contained in them. Those errors were verified and tallied by a team of proofreaders. Then, finally, according to Grammarly, “we calculated the average number of mistakes per one hundred words by dividing the total word count of the comments by the total number of mistakes for each candidate.”  Grammarly  The Democrats’ supporters came out on top, with 4.2 mistakes per 100 words, versus 8.7 mistakes per 100 words among the Republican candidates’ backers.  As for Trump, his supporters ranked last among supporters of all candidates from both parties when it came to grammar, with an average of 12.6 errors per 100 words. Rick Santorum’s followers logged 11.5 errors per 100 words to claim the penultimate rank.  The top five spots, as far as fewest linguistic miscues logged, were dominated by Democrats, led by 3.1 errors per 100 words for supporters of Republican-cum-Democrat Lincoln Chafee. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton’s supporters were tied for fifth, with 6.3 errors per 100 words, with those of GOP candidate Carly Fiorina.  Relatedly, or perhaps merely coincidentally, a Pew Research study released Oct. 1 showed that the biggest chunk of Trump’s supporters, 30%, possesses a high-school education or less. In contrast, 48% of Clinton’s declared supporters have a bachelor’s or advanced degree.  Trump came out fighting in an interview with CNN late Tuesday, saying even if rivals Fiorina and Ben Carson are gaining in the GOP polls, he’s in it for the long haul. “I’m not getting out. I’m going to win, OK?” Trump added. “The answer is: I’m going all the way, and I’m going to win.”"
politifact13496,1,The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads,"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.  It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.  Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.  CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.  @solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016  @solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016  The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.  This is exactly how fake news spreads  But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.  The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh."
E609,1,Kale: The superfood you should be eating,"Kale: The superfood you should be eating  Kale, referred to by some as 'spinach's better half' was rarely found on supermarket shelves 20 years ago, but today it has become renowned as a superfood, making appearances in salads, smoothies and even baked into kale 'crisps'. Kale is one vegetable you should definitely be eating - we're here with the facts!  What is kale?  Kale is a cruciferous vegetable that belongs to the same family as the humble cabbage - in fact, you'll often hear Italians call black kale 'cavolo nero' (black cabbage). Most supermarkets stock bags of curly kale, but you'll also find baby kale available - great for salads - as well as red Russian kale and Redbor kale, which can be used interchangeably with the curly variety. Curly kale has distinctive silver green leaves which are rather tough and fibrous; for this reason, many people prefer to cook kale, to break down some of these fibres and create a more pleasant texture.  A healthy choice  Kale contains just 36 calories per cup and it also contains the highest levels of antioxidants of any fruit or vegetable (1). It's a great source of vitamins A, C and K and is packed with fibre, iron and calcium. It could even reduce your risk of cancer thanks to its flavonoids and isothiocyanates (2). If you're looking to keep your vision healthy, kale is rich in lutein (3), an antioxidant that's essential for healthy eyes. 1kg of kale contains 76mg of lutein - experts recommend we eat between 6 and 10mg lutein a day.  The vitamin A contained in kale can help to boost your immune system whilst promoting healthy skin and vision, and you might be surprised to learn that kale contains 17 times more vitamin C than carrots! 80g of cooked kale contains 57mg of vitamin C. The vitamin K in kale helps to keep bones strong and promotes normal blood clotting. Talk about nutritious!  Cooking kale - what's best?  There are several ways to cook this superfood - the most popular are simmering for long periods, which can reduce the fibrous texture of the leaves, although they'll lose their bright green colour. To maintain kale's vibrancy and flavour, blanching followed by pan frying is recommended. Unlike some other greens, kale won't turn mushy with overcooking - it's fairly foolproof to prepare and holds its shape well. If you're using kale in salad, cutting it into thin strips and massaging them with coarse salt or an olive oil and vinegar dressing helps to break down the fibres.  Should you eat kale?  We know that kale is classed as a superfood, but there are some people who shouldn't eat it, or at the very least should limit how much kale the eat. This leafy green wonder can cause digestive problems for anyone with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other digestive issues. That's because it contains insoluble fibre, which can become stuck in the gut if not processed properly. If you suffer from bloating or gas when eating cabbage or beans, kale should probably be avoided.  Kale and your thyroid  Eating raw kale in salads or smoothies could actually affect the function of your thyroid gland - when cooked, the substances that have this effect become inactive, so if you suffer from thyroid problems, you're best to stick to cooked kale. For most of us though, a handful of raw kale in a salad or smoothie daily shouldn't cause any ill-effects.  What to do with kale  Bought some curly kale and stuck for ideas as to what to make? Here are some quick, simple and tasty ideas:  Pan-fried Garlic Kale  This makes a great side dish, loaded with heart-healthy good fat from the olive oil and immune boosting garlic.  You'll need:  2 large bunches of kale  2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  2 garlic cloves, minced  Salt and pepper  Method:  Stem the kale and wash the leaves, placing them in a pan of boiling water with a generous amount of salt. Blanch for around 4 minutes, then plunge the leaves into a bowl of iced water, to stop them cooking. Drain, dry and chop the leave coarsely, heating your olive oil in a heavy frying pan. Add the minced garlic and cook for around 30 seconds, then stir in the kale. Cook for a couple of minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper before serving.  Broccoli and Kale Stuffed Baked Potatoes  This is a great hearty dish from Katie at the Kitchen Door. It tastes pretty naughty, but it's actually loaded with veg and super-healthy; perfect for lunch or served with chicken for dinner.  You'll need:  2 russet potatoes  1 cup cooked broccoli  6 large kale leaves  2-3 tbsp grated cheddar  1/2 cup milk  Salt and pepper  Method:  Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, to stop the skins bursting in the oven, then place them on a tray and bake for around an hour.  Prepare your kale by washing, drying and roughly chopping/shredding the leaves. Blanch the kale in boiling water for 2 minutes, drain and run under cold water. Once the potatoes have cooked, slice them open and scoop out the insides into a blender or bowl. Add the kale, milk, broccoli and salt and pepper and blend or mash well with a fork to mix.  Scoop the mix back into the potato skins, sprinkle with grated cheese and return to the oven for around 10 minutes, until the cheese has melted. You can finish the skins off under the grill for a golden, bubbling topping, if you like!

E404,1,The Obama Doctrine: A New Paradigm Worthy of a Second Nobel Peace Prize,"I really, really apologize for being away. And I will try to stay focused here for the future. But this is an amazing, amazing thing that happened today.  The President announced this morning a nuclear deal with Iran that achieves every single objective the US had sought with respect to Iran's nuclear program:  It reduces Iran's enriched uranium stockpile by 98%. That's NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. And the deal would only leave the lowest grade uranium behind. If Iran had enough of even that, it could build a bomb in a year, but the deal's reduction of the stockpile to 300 kilograms means that Iran won't have enough. Reduces the number of centrifuges by two-thirds. Down to roughly 6,000, there won't be enough centrifuges - which for the Donald Trump lovers among us is the thing that you use to enrich the uranium - to make a bomb. Leaves only one facility open for nuclear enrichment, and only for energy purposes. It gives the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, unprecedented and unrestricted access to all of Iran's nuclear facilities, and to any facility they suspect may be running a nuclear operation. There's no hiding, and there's no sanctions relief until IAEA verifies Iranian compliance.  The Republicans are completely beside themselves, Netanyahu had a fit on TV, and Fox News is running a cute headline saying that Obama has a ""tough sales job"" in Congress. Cute, because they are well aware that Congress chose to hand over the responsibility for this deal to the President, by willingly making any Congressional objection to the deal subject to a Presidential veto.  But let's be clear about why the Global Neocon Movement is losing its bearings today: the deal between Iran, the United States and five other global powers due to take final shape in a UN Security Council Resolution, slams the door on another costly military conflict in the Middle East. Secretary Kerry and President Obama have done the hard work, provided exemplary diplomatic leadership of global powers to achieve a stunning victory for global security and nuclear nonproliferation without firing a single shot. The Neocons aren't getting their war.  The current leader of the global Neocons, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, did everything he could to force a war with Iran. He even came to the US and spoke to the US Congress, breaking long-held traditions that foreign leaders respect the role of the President first. He even went so far today as to say that Israel isn't bound by this deal. Well, thank you, Captain Obvious.  While Netanyahu may be firing off word salad and empty threats, the historic achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran shows why President Obama was absolutely the critical leader this country and this world needed at this critical junction in time. This president, again and again, have proven the willingness to wield the power of tough but fair diplomacy in the interest of US and global security and regardless of lobby groups or political winds.  This ain't his first time at the rodeo. This is the same president who disarmed a middle eastern madman in the middle of his country's civil war without firing a single shot. Even as the president prepared to take military action against Syria, he never failed to pursue every diplomatic path.  This is the same man who ended two of history's longest wars, and made new history on reduction of actual active nuclear warheads for both US and Russia. He demonstrated that the United States isn't merely interested in keeping nukes out of the hands of extremist dictators but that global zero is an actual policy worth making real progress towards.  This is the president who has not backed away from using force when absolutely necessary - as he did in enforcing a UN Security Council resolution in Libya, but has never held the threat of force in the manner of a bully.  This is the president that took immeasurable risk to eliminate the world's most notorious terrorist, showing his resolve that the United States will not stop in the pursuit of the most wanted. Yet, he successfully conducted and framed it as a targeted operation rather than a war.  This is the same president who just this month re-opened diplomatic relations with Cuba, after a freeze since the days of JFK, opening not simply a new chapter in US-Cuba relations but a new direction in American leadership: the quintessential Obama Doctrine: The principle that the United States should never fear to negotiate and that we are a power strong enough to take calculated risks. Again and again, that doctrine, combined with the remarkable dedication of public servants who have truly put their country first, has borne fruit.  I believe - as I know President Obama does - that only one global power could have made this new direction a reality, and it's the United States. Only the United States could take the steps to be right without ever doubting our might. Only the United States could transform international relations from being based on mutually assured destruction to mutual interest, respect, and construction. Only the United States could take the world's itchy fingers off the trigger while still demanding results for a more integrated, fairer, and more connected globe.  But just because the United States is the only power that could transform the parameters of global relations was no guarantee that it would. Not until a president named Barack Obama was sworn into the Oval Office. President Obama has led the world in one issue after another - from trade to conflicts - into not just a new direction but a new paradigm: one where the world should have no illusions about America's strength but other nations need not set their policies to counter an American threat but rather to align with American engagement.  And that is a big change. That is something we have not really seen since America's rise to become a global power in the early 20th century. With Kennedy it had a chance but that chance died with the assassination of JFK himself. With that exception, sure, some presidents in the last century have been more war-prone than others, and certainly who is president made a difference. But now, Barack Obama has not only revived that new paradigm of America's role in the world as a power comfortable in its position to lead in diplomacy and engagement without fear, he has given that new paradigm shape.  That is why Barack Obama has secured his place in history, and that is why he has earned a new Nobel Peace Prize - to be shared with Secretary Kerry, I'm sure, but it's the president that gave this new paradigm complete shape, within the confines of which Kerry did his amazing work.  And so, I want to remind those of us discouraged by today's politics of tear-downs and disrespect that even through it all, we truly live in blessed times. And we are blessed with a leader we needed so desperately, even if his goodness isn't something the current climate makes us feel like we always deserved."
politifact15159,1,Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison,"Convicted church shooter Dylann Roof has been transferred to death row at Terre Haute Federal Prison in Indiana — the facility that houses male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.  Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show.  Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates.  Dylann Roof is escorted into the court room at the Charleston County Judicial Center in Charleston, South Carolina, April 10, 2017. Grace Beahm/Pool / Reuters  In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.  He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.  Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.  Read more about the lethal injection controversy here  As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 — drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.  Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his ""unique"" security arrangements.  After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.  Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon.  Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment"" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected."

The Business Standard News has acquired audio files of a conversation between Stacey Dash and her friend Rashika Johnson. Dash is heard on tape breaking down why she decided to come out as a conservative.  “Girl, it’s all about getting paid,” Dash said. “I’m in my 40s going up against bitches half my age for roles. It was getting tough. This conservative gig is about cash money. I got a mortgage and kids to put through college.”  Dash also said she was hired at FOX News because of her looks, not her political opinions.  “They hired me because I make old, white dudes horny,” Dash told her friend. “Take a look at the other women on FOX News, they all look like models. Hell, I get emails from old white men in the South, saying they never thought of f**king a black woman until they saw me.”  “Ann Coulter told me there is good money to be made selling lame books to dumb rednecks,” Dash said. “Like her, I don’t believe half the crap I say. I’m an actress, give me a script and I’ll give you a performance.”  Dash also says becoming a conservative was a great career move.  “I got a book deal, a TV gig and a bunch of speaking engagements lined up,” Dash said. “And unlike in Hollywood, I can keep this going even when I get old.”"
E432,1,Internal Sony Documents Reveal Playstation Controllers Are Made of Dog Noses,"0  TOKYO, Japan –  Sony International, the company behind the Playstation 4 video game console, is under some serious scrutiny after a set of internal documents were leaked detailing the manufacturing process of the company’s popular video game controllers.  “It seems that Sony has been using the noses of dead dogs to create the grips on the joystick of their controllers for quite some time,” said investigator Joe Goldsmith. “All the way back to the original Playstation console, the company has been buying the carcasses of dead dogs in bulk, shipping them from all over the world to their headquarters in Japan, for purposes of using the skin from the noses as the material for the joystick.”  In the documents, Sony CEO Nah Bro Li said that the company had tried “many different options” for the joystick grips before landing on the noses of dogs.  “Nothing works better than dog nose for the small grips of the joystick,” read the text in one of the memos. “This, though, would be very bad for the public to hear, and we would have many animal rights activists at our door. This is something we want to continue doing, but with great secrecy.”  “Clearly they could be using anything else to make these,” said Goldsmith. “Rubber is the first thing that comes to mind, for example. Sony has showed a clear lack of compassion for animals in using the noses of dogs to make their controllers. On the other hand, it does explain why they are $60 a pop. At this time, we believe all the dogs they used were already dead by other causes. It’s a great thing to discover now, though, before the company had that chance to start paying people to kill dogs strictly for their use. ”  Private investigators hired by PETA and other animal rights groups have begun digging into other company’s controllers as well, including those made by Microsoft for their XBox systems, as well as leading 3rd party manufacturer Mad Katz.  0  Comments  comments"

politifact13559,1,Pence: “Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had”,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”  “First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”  The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”  He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”  “How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”  “There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded."
pheme_173,1,Paris Massacre Suspects Killed in Dramatic Hostage Raids,"DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.  In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.  In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.  French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.  The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.  The U.S. on Friday issued a worldwide travel alert warning that terrorists could target Westerners. French authorities Friday were trying to establish whether any of the attackers had ties to extremist Islamist groups in France or abroad.  The gunman at the grocery store, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, is believed to be connected to the Kouachi brothers, authorities said. French police were hunting for a woman they say was an accomplice, Hayat Boumeddiene. Five people connected to the attackers are still being held by authorities, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.  Explosions and gunfire rang out in both places — at the printing factory in the countryside town of Dammartin-en-Goele and at the kosher market in Paris — in what the French hoped was a conclusion to the spasm of terror that has gripped France for more than two days.  One hostage was freed at the printing factory, authorities said. At the market, four hostages were killed and 15 were freed, according to Israeli government officials who spoke to their French counterparts. The four dead hostages were killed by the gunman before the police raid, Molins said. Four officers were injured, including one who was seriously hurt.  In a speech to the country, President Francois Hollande thanked the security forces for their professionalism. He said that the threat of terrorism was not over, but he said France had overcome its challenge.  ""We are free when we are not afraid,"" he said. ""We carry an idea that is bigger than ourselves, and we are able to defend it everywhere where peace is threatened.""  He cautioned against racism and called for a national march of unity on Sunday. He described the hostage siege at the kosher market as ""a terrible anti-Semitic act.""  U.S. officials have said that Said Kouachi, 34, trained with al Qaeda in Yemen several years ago, and his younger brother was convicted on a terrorism charge in 2008. They had been on the run since speeding away from the magazine’s offices after the attack on Wednesday.  The brothers were spotted Friday by police driving in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 20 miles outside the capital, at about 9:30 a.m. local time, or 3:30 a.m. ET. A gunfight broke out, and the brothers apparently holed up in the nearest building they could find, a family-owned printing business, taking a company manager hostage. Said Kouachi was shot in the throat during the gunfight, Molins said.  Yves Albarello, a French lawmaker, was quoted by the French TV station i-Tele as saying that the Kouachi brothers had told police they wanted to “die as martyrs.” The report could not be confirmed by NBC News.  Hours later came word of a second siege at the kosher market. It was not clear how many people were inside, but Thibeaut, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman, suggested there were many because it was the morning before the Jewish Sabbath, which begins Friday night.  Many ambulances were outside the market, and police asked all businesses nearby to close.  The Associated Press, citing an unnamed police official, reported that the gunman had threatened to kill hostages if police stormed the printing plant 25 miles away.  Authorities locked down schools near Dammartin-en-Goele. At one, the Lycee Charles de Gaulle, about 500 students were being kept inside.  “We are all scared,” one student, Angelina Monzili, 16, told NBC News. “We came to school expecting a normal day. We were told that the terrorists are really close. Our families are worried about us. We saw police cars flying past, and ambulances.”  People who live in the area were to told to stay away from windows, turn off lights and stay indoors. “It’s basically a war zone in Dammartin-en-Goele,” one witness told BFM TV.  Nearly 100,000 security personnel were on alert across France as the twin dramas played out.  Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport told NBC News that some aircraft coming into land had been redirected to its southern two runways, which are further away from Dammartin-en-Goele. “The town is a little bit too close to the airport,” a spokesman said.  In the tense hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, profiles began to emerge of the Kouachi brothers, who were known to French and American counterterrorism officials.  Two senior U.S. counterterrorism officials told NBC News that Said Kouachi, 34, traveled to Yemen in 2011 to be trained by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is considered the most violent branch of the terror network.  Cherif Kouachi, 32, was sentenced to prison in 2008 after a Paris court found him and six other men guilty of helping funnel fighters to Iraq. A Homeland Security official told NBC News that the brothers had been on the U.S. no-fly list “for years.”  A purported member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed in a Twitter message that the group directed the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to Flashpoint Intelligence, a global security firm and an NBC News counterterrorism consultant.  During the siege, Cherif Kouachi spoke by telephone to a French television station, saying he ""was sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda"" and had been financed by the group's leader, Anwar al-Awlaki before Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.  The final gun battle began after the brothers emerged from the printing factory and started shooting, Molins said. Security forces returned fire, killing them. Their hostage, the company manager, escaped unharmed. It later turned out that a second plant employee had been hiding under a sink, undetected during the entire ordeal.  Investigators found ammunition and heavy weapons in the factory, including a rocket launcher, Molins said.  On Thursday, elite anti-terrorist forces converged on several villages after two masked robbers with machine guns matching the Kouachi brothers' description held up a gas station in Villers-Cotteret, France.  Charlie Hebdo’s offices had been firebombed in the past after publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The publication’s chief editor — who was known as Charb — was an outspoken supporter of free speech who had reportedly been put on an al Qaeda hit list. He was among those slain.  NBC News' Alexander Smith, Nikolai Miller, Jason Cumming, Richard Engel, Robert Windrem and Pete Williams, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Nancy Ing reported from Paris.

E621,1,[UPDATED] Woman in Coma After Her Butt Implants Explode During Squat Routine,"Serena Beuford, 27, is in a coma after her butt implants popped while she was working out, WOAI reports. She was at a local Boston gym doing squats when the implants broke down. Beuford apparently yelled that her butt was gone before she collapsed.  According to several sources, a patron at the gym, Jewel, said this is what happened: ""I heard a loud popping noise followed by the woman falling to the floor. She was screaming my ass is gone! I had no idea what she was talking about until I saw her cushion like butt missing when EMS took her out the gym. She used to always show off her butt in the gym and tried to get guys attention with her work outs."" It's not certain if this is exactly how things went down, or if the quote was fabricated.  According to her sister, Beuford was filming an Instagram video and hoped to get famous for her 64-inch butt. She had gotten the implants from an unlicensed clinic that is now under investigation. Doctors say Beuford will require surgery, as the exploding implants caused some serious damage to her rectum, colon, and lower intestines.  The moral of this story? Don't get illegal butt injections. Get famous on Instagram by posting pictures of your cat or something instead.  Update 7/15, 12: 45 p.m.: It turns out this story was entirely made up, and it's virtually impossible to have anything like this happen. According to Douglas Steinbrech, a board certified plastic surgeon, ""Implants don't pop. They stay in position. It's not like a balloon. If she had a balloon filled with some kind of saline, even if it popped, the fluid still stays there and then it takes hours for the fluid to resorb. It's not like you'd have that immediate deflation."" And even if an untrained, uncertified back-alley ""surgeon"" did manage to put a balloon into someone's body, it would have to somehow break the skin to deflate dramatically. In fact, once implants are in and healed up, Dr. Steinbrech says you'll have full range of movement and even rigorous exercise shouldn't impact the implant.  Dealing in complete hypotheticals, Dr. Steinbrech says, ""The only way that that could be is if someone took breast sizers, which is basically a balloon that we blow up with saline or air just to see how big the implant is. That could rupture, but it would be an air pocket and that would take some time for that to be resorbed. If the implant eroded by the anus and eroded through the skin and the air pocket popped, it could go through the colon and come out like gas."" So a very specific (and borderline impossible) series of circumstances could cause someone to essentially fart their implant out. But the short answer is still no. ""I've seen everything,"" says Dr. Steinbrech about implants. ""And I have yet to see a balloon that's blown up with air.""  Still, getting implants from someone who isn't board-certified can be incredibly dangerous and even deadly. ""Some places will inject things. I've seen patients going to a nail salon and getting tile caulking. That can cause problems, and if it gets into the arteries or veins, it can cause a deadly and immediate emboli,"" says Dr. Steinbrech.  So although this story is, at best, implausible, it's still a very bad idea to go anywhere other than a board-certified surgeon for your butt implants.  Follow Frank on Twitter.

pheme_273,1,Questions linger after fans wait hours for rumoured Prince show,"Send this page to someone via email  TORONTO – Concert promoter Live Nation apologized Tuesday after fans stood in line for hours as rumours swirled about a surprise Prince concert at Toronto’s Massey Hall.  “Live Nation wants to apologize for any inconvenience experienced by Prince and his fans in Toronto when Ticketmaster posted incorrect concert information on their website earlier today,” read a statement on Facebook.  “The only reservation was for a production rehearsal. There was no concert scheduled for today.”  Whispers that the Purple Rain singer would take to the stage with his all-female band 3rdeyegirl started late Monday, fuelled by a cryptic tweet from the band in which Toronto was spelled backwards.  “4th day of November, we need a purple high: OTNOROT CALLING…,” read the tweet.  The tweet was deleted just after 8:30 a.m.  Story continues below advertisement  Fans who lined up all day in hopes of getting tickets to see the pop legend weren’t told until after 3 p.m. that there was no concert.  So, questions linger. If no concert was scheduled, why did Live Nation wait so long to announce there would be no concert — when it knew people were waiting in the cold and rain? Why did crews erect metal barricades to contain the line-up outside the venue?  Late Tuesday, Shure Media Group issued a statement on behalf of 3rdeyegirl.  “We are thankful for the outpouring of love and support and apologize for any confusion surrounding the anticipated performance tonight. Our technical crew is set up in Toronto to rehearse lighting and sound for possible future performances.”  The statement added: “There is not a scheduled performance tonight; there was never confirmation of a show.”  Several music industry insiders contacted by Global News scoffed at the claim that gear was set-up on the Massey Hall stage to rehearse lighting and sound.  In a series of tweets late Tuesday, Toronto-born 3rdeyegirl guitarist Donna Grantis thanked fans for their support and apologized for the confusion.  Fellow Torontonians, thank you for your love & support today. I can’t wait to perform in our great city for you & I hope to make you proud! — Donna Grantis (@DonnaGrantis) November 5, 2014  For all those who waited in line, I apologize for any disappointment caused by the confusion. — Donna Grantis (@DonnaGrantis) November 5, 2014  We promise to deliver an unforgettable experience when we rock Toronto. Much Love xo #PrinceArmy — Donna Grantis (@DonnaGrantis) November 5, 2014  Drummer Hannah Welton said on Twitter there was “a total mix up” and “there was never a show confirmed.”  Story continues below advertisement  Warner Music Canada had no comment and Prince was reportedly in New York City.  The 56-year-old singer has performed numerous times at venues in Toronto and called the city home for several years in the early 2000s while married to locally-born Manuela Testolini.  “I love Toronto,” he told the Canadian Press in 2004. “It’s cosmopolitan. There’s all sorts of different kinds of people everywhere you go in Toronto, there’s all sorts of great music, great restaurants, great night spots that don’t respond to a lot of American playlists and have playlists which I really dig.  “It’s a real melting pot in every sense of the word.”"
E27,1,Legislative time bomb,"Legislative time bomb  Updated  Today the Australian Senate voted on the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Even the name of this bill should have rung warning bells as carbon is the foundation of life and is not a pollutant.  It is claimed that there is a scientific consensus about human-induced climate change. There is no consensus and consensus is a process of politics not science. Science is married to evidence no matter how uncomfortable.  To argue that temperature has increased 0.8ºC since 1850 is misleading because the Little Ice Age ended in 1850 and it is absolutely no surprise that temperature increases after a long cold period. Since 1850, there has been temperature increase (1860-1880, 1910-1940, 1976-1998) and decrease (1880-1910, 1940-1976,1998-present) and the rate of the three periods of temperature increase has been the same.  A simple question does not get asked: what part of warming and cooling since 1850 is natural?  The first two warmings could not be related to human additions of CO2 from industry hence why wouldn't the 1976-1998 warming also be due to natural processes?  It is claimed that, since 1950, human additions of CO2 has been the dominant cause of warming. The scales and rates of temperature change in the past have been far greater than when humans emitted CO2 from industry. What has caused the coolings (1940-1976 and 1998-present) or, by some tortured logic, is global cooling this century actually global warming cunningly disguised?  At present, atmospheric temperature is decreasing and CO2 is increasing again showing that CO2 is not the principal driver of climate change. Planet Earth is a warm wet greenhouse volcanic planet. The planet is dynamic, change is normal.  Five of the six major ice ages occurred when the atmospheric CO2 content was up to 1,000 times higher than at present and for half of Earth history CO2 has been sequestered naturally into algal reefs, coral reefs, sediments, altered rocks, bacteria, plants, soils and oceans. This process is still taking place.  The hypothesis that high atmospheric CO2 drives global warming is therefore invalid. The Earth's atmospheric CO2 initially derived from volcanic degassing. Much of it still does and the rest is recycled CO2 from the oceans, rocks and life.  The claim that warming will increase in the future has been disproved by the climate modellers' own data. Climate models of the 1990s did not predict the El Niño of 1998 or the cooling in the 21st Century.  If such models are inaccurate only 10 years into the future, how can they be accurate for longer-term predictions? Furthermore, when these models are run backwards they cannot be used to identify climate-driving processes involving a huge transfer of energy (eg El Niño), volcanoes, solar changes and supernovae.  Models tell us more about the climatologists than they do about Nature.  Another claim is that climate cannot be reversed. This invokes a non-dynamic planet. The fact that previous warmings with an atmospheric temperature some five degrees Celcius higher than now (eg Minoan, Roman, Medieval) were reversed is conveniently ignored as are the great climate cycles driven by the Sun, the Earth's orbit, tectonics and tides seen on modern, archaeological and geological time scales.  'Tipping points' are another sensationalist unsubstantiated claim. In past times when atmospheric CO2 and temperature were far higher, there were no tipping points, climate disasters or runaway greenhouse. The climate catastrophists attempt to create fear by mentioning the carbon cycle but just happen to omit that significant oxygenation of the atmosphere took place when the planet was in middle age and this process of photosynthesis resulted the recycling and sequestration of carbon.  The atmosphere now contains 800 billion tonnes (Gt) of carbon as CO2, soils vegetation and humus contain 2,000 Gt carbon in various compounds, the oceans contain 39,000 Gt and limestone, a rock that contains 44 per cent CO2, contains 65,000,000 Gt carbon.  The atmosphere contains only 0.001 per cent of all carbon at the surface of the Earth and far greater quantities are present in the lower crust and mantle of the Earth. Human additions of CO2 to the atmosphere must be taken into perspective.  Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.  Climate chestnuts about polar ice are commonly raised. What is not raised is that ice is dynamic, it advances and retreats, while the Arctic is warming the Antarctic is cooling and vice versa and if ice did not retreat, then the planet would be covered in ice.  For less than 20 per cent of time Earth has had ice. The Antarctic ice sheet has been with us for 37 million years during which time there were extended periods of warmth and the ice sheet did not disappear.  So too with the Greenland ice sheet which has enjoyed nearly three million years of expansion and contraction yet did not disappear in extended times far warmer than at present.  Sea level is also dynamic and has risen and fallen over time by at least 600 metres. Since the end of the glaciation 14,000 years ago, sea level has risen some 130 metres at almost one centimetre per year. It is now at about one milimetre per year.  This sea level rise has flooded Bass Strait, the English Channel and destabilised the west Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is this sea level rise that has stimulated coral growth, created larger shallow water ecologies and changed the shape of landmasses.  The fear mongering suggestion that oceans will become acid is also misleading. The oceans are buffered by sediments and volcanic rocks on the sea floor and even in past times when atmospheric temperature and CO2 were far higher than at present, there were no acid oceans. If there had been, there would be no fossils with calcium carbonate shells.  Although industrial aerosols are decreasing, the climate catastrophists omit to state that volcanic aerosols kill.  At least three of the five major mass extinctions of complex life on Earth were probably due to aerosols.  If our climate catastrophists want to twiddle the dials and stop climate change, they need to play God and change radiation in the galaxy, the Sun, the Earth's orbit, tidal cycles and plate tectonics. Once they have mastered volcanoes, then we can let them loose on climate change.  Today Australia faced the biggest financial decision since Federation. There still has not been an independent scientific and financial due diligence on an emissions trading scheme.  It is this legislative time bomb that will destroy productive industries in rural and industrial Australia.

pheme_335,1,Gunmen Take Hostages in 2 Standoffs With French Police,"French police were negotiating Friday with two sets of gunmen who are believed to have taken hostages in two separate but linked incidents two days after the deadly terrorist attack in Paris. The sounds of gunshots and loud explosions at both sites could be heard on local television broadcasts Friday evening.  Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the prime suspects in the killing of 12 people at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, were located by police northeast of Paris and then chased to a factory on an industrial estate where they are believed to have taken one hostage. French officials said they had made contact with the brothers who told them that they want to die as martyrs.  As that siege unfolded, a man believed to be Amedy Coulibaly, 32, a suspect in the fatal shooting of a policewoman on Wednesday, attacked customers at a kosher supermarket near the Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. Local media said several were injured and at least two killed in the shooting before Coulibaly took refuge in the supermarket with at least five hostages.  Police assumed the Wednesday shooting was just a tragic coincidence, unrelated to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. But on Friday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls told reporters that the two incidents were in fact connected, and that the shooter had communicated with the Kouachi brothers—suggesting that Wednesday’s attack might be part of a bigger plan. “The latest advances in the investigation allows us to establish a connection” between the two incidents, Valls said on Friday afternoon, while he was meeting the grief-sticken staff members of Charlie Hebdo, at the offices of the French daily newspaper Libération.  Police said they were also looking for Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, in connection with Wednesday shooting. It is not clear if she was with Coulibaly at the Porte de Vincennes. Le Monde reported that Boumeddiene was Coulibaly’s former girlfriend.  Earlier in the morning, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, aged 34 and 32, fled the wooded areas further of Paris in a Peugeot car they hijacked on the road, according to French media reports. Shortly after there was sounds of gunfire, as the suspects fled towards CTF Creation Tendance Decouverte, a sign making and printing factory in an industrial zone close to Paris’s main airport.  For the first time since Wednesday, French officials sounded confident that they were close to a climax in the manhunt. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters on Friday morning that SWAT teams had the men cornered in the factory in Dammartin-en-Goèle and that special forces were on site, ready to move in. “Operations will be conducted in the hours, the minutes,” he said shortly after 10 a.m.  France Info radio interviewed a man who gave his name as Didier who said he went into the factory when the gunmen were there. He had an appointment with the factory manager and he shook the hand of one of the gunmen who he took to be a police officer. “We all shook hands and my client told me to leave.” Didier said the gunman told him: “Go, we don’t kill civilians”. He added “I thought it was strange.”  He said: “As I left I didn’t know what it was, it wasn’t normal. I did not know what was going on. Was it a hostage taking or a burglary?”  Christelle Alleume, who works across the street, said that a round of gunfire interrupted her coffee break Friday morning.  “We heard shots and we returned very fast because everyone was afraid,” she told i-Tele. “We had orders to turn off the lights and not approach the windows.”  Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said both men were known to intelligence services.  On Thursday evening French officials told the U.S. that Saïd Kouachi had traveled to Yemen in 2011 and received weapons training from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of AQAP died in a U.S. drone attack that same year. The younger brother Chérif spent 18 months in jail in 2008 for having attempted to fight with jihadist groups against U.S. forces in Iraq. Police had monitored his radical views for years. By contrast to his brother, Saïd had managed to escape arrest so far. Cazeneuve said on Thursday that the older Kouachi brother “has never been prosecuted or convicted, but has appeared on the periphery of judicial cases.”  The head of Britain’s MI5 security agency said on Thursday that British intelligence believed terror networks were actively planning “complex and ambitious plots” against Western targets. Speaking at MI5 headquarters in London, Andrew Parker told members of the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank, that those fighting in Syria were currently plotting assaults abroad. “We know, for example, that a group of core al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West,” he said.  Malcolm Rifkind, a British legislator and chairman of the House of Commons intelligence and security committee said the brothers had been in close contact with associates in Yemen in recent days. “What is emerging in Paris is that the two individual responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo were communicating with people in the Yemen over the last days, last few weeks,” he told the BBC.

E385,1,Scammers Targeting Facebook Users with Dislike Button Scam,"New Dislike button scam has started to make rounds on the Facebook, one of the most popular and widely used social media networks.  This scam is expected to spread far and wide because of its nature and how the Facebook users are anxiously waiting to get their hands on the dislike button.  For those readers who are not aware, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially broke the news during an in-person questions and answers session earlier this week that the team is working on the dislike button and will be publicly unveiled soon.  Scammers are determined to use the dislike button as bait to attract novice Facebook users into believing that clicking on some links would give them an early access to the dislike button.  Since the news about the dislike button has become official now with the button expected to be launched soon, the scammers have found a great opportunity in this and have decided to exploit it for their benefit by starting a scam campaign.  So their new scam campaign included a group of links that are explicitly designed to spread itself through Facebook by misleadingly claiming to offer an early access to the much-awaited dislike button.  The headline of scam link reads:  “Get newly introduced facebook dislike button on your profile.”  Furthermore, the description says that it is an “invite-only feature” and can only be activated by clicking on the provided link, which ultimately leads the victim to a scam and malicious website.  It is quite obvious that these campaigns are expressly designed by attackers to spread itself by gaining access to your Facebook and ultimately sharing those links on your timeline. Additionally, those links will also be sent as a message to your Facebook friends.  Once the links are successfully spread on your Facebook, the scam campaign will then ask you to fill out the intrusive surveys in an attempt to gather your personal information as well as asking for your account credentials. All of those would then be used to spam you and your contacts via email.  Some links may also install malware on your computer or spread the malware through your social media accounts. However, we aren’t sure if anyone has been infected with a malware through the dislike button scam.  So it is recommended that every user should stay away from these malicious links because they won’t be providing you an access to the dislike button.  Last month, a similar phishing scam was discovered on the Facebook which was designed to harvest Facebook login credentials of the victims.  We suggest you first verify the links and the authenticity of the news being shared by anyone to ensure the safety of your online presence and social media accounts because clicking on such links could lead to theft of your personal information."
pheme_101,1,ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A320-211 D-AIPX Prads-Haute-Bléone,"An Airbus A320 operated by Germanwings was destroyed in an accident in a mountainous area in southern France. All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed.  Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 10:00 hours local time (09:00 UTC) on a regular passenger service to Düsseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight.  At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged.  At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased.  At 10:33:12, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min.  The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt.  At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer.  Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react.  Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response.  The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door.  At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success.  As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28.  The GPWS then sounded: ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters.  Probable Cause:  Causes:  The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence.  The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle:  - the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME;  - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly;  - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality.    Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps.

BEA issued 10 Safety Recommendations  EASA issued 2 EASA Safety Information Bulletins  Issued: 27-MAR-2015 To: Commercial air transport (CAT) operators EASA SIB 2015-04 The Agency recommends operators to re-assess the safety and security risks associated with flight crew members leaving the flight crew compartment due to operational or physiological needs during non-critical phases of flight. Based on this assessment, operators are recommended to implement procedures requiring at least two persons authorised in accordance with CAT.GEN.MPA.135 to be in the flight crew compartment at all times, or other equivalent mitigating measures to address risks identified by the operators revised assessment. (Withdrawn) Issued: 13-MAR-2016 To: EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-011 EASA require that when a class 1 medical certificate is issued to an applicant with a history of psychological/psychiatric trouble of any sort, conditions for the follow-up of his/her fitness to fly be defined. This may include restrictions on the duration of the certificate or other operational limitations and the need for a specific psychiatric evaluation for subsequent revalidations or renewals. Issued: 13-MAR-2016 To: EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-012 EASA include in the European Plan for Aviation Safety an action for the EU Member States to perform a routine analysis of in-flight incapacitation, with particular reference but not limited to psychological or psychiatric issues, to help with continuous re-evaluation of the medical assessment criteria, to improve the expression of risk of in-flight incapacitation in numerical terms and to encourage data collection to validate the effectiveness of these criteria.

These rules should take into account the specificities of pilots, for whom the risk of losing their medical certificate, being not only a financial matter but also a matter related to their passion for flying, may deter them from seeking appropriate health care. Issued: 13-MAR-2016 To: BMVI; Bundesärztekammer Recommendation FRAN-2016-019/-20 Without waiting for action at EU level, the BMVI and the Bundesärztekammer (BÄK) edit guidelines for all German health care providers to: - remind them of the possibility of breaching medical confidentiality and reporting to the LBA or another appropriate authority if the health of a commercial pilot presents a potential public safety risk. - define what can be considered as ""imminent danger"" and ""threat to public safety"" when dealing with pilots health issues - limit the legal consequence for health care providers breaching medical confidentiality in good faith to lessen or prevent a threat to public safety Issued: 13-MAR-2016 To: EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-021 EASA ensure that European operators promote the implementation of peer support groups to provide a process for pilots, their families and peers to report and discuss personal and mental health issues, with the assurance that information will be kept in-confidence in a just-culture work environment, and that pilots will be supported as well as guided with the aim of providing them with help, ensuring flight safety and allowing them to return to flying duties, where applicable. Issued: 21-JUL-2016 To: Commercial air transport (CAT) operators EASA SIB 2016-09 CAT.OP.MPA.210 of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 stipulates that flight crew members required to be on duty in the flight crew compartment shall remain at the assigned station, unless absence is necessary for the performance of duties in connection with the operations or for physiological needs, provided at least one suitably qualified pilot remains at the controls of the aircraft at all times. In such cases, the Agency recommends operators to assess the safety and security risks associated with a flight crew member remaining alone in the flight crew compartment. If the assessment leads the operator to require two authorised persons in accordance with CAT.GEN.MPA.135 to be in the flight crew compartment at all times, operators should ensure that: (a) the role of the authorised person, other than the operating pilot, in the flight crew compartment is clearly defined, considering that his/her main task should be to open the secure door when the flight crew member who left the compartment returns; (b) only suitably qualified flight crew members are allowed to sit at the controls; (c) safety and security procedures are established for his/her presence in the flight crew compartment (e.g. operation of the flight deck, specific procedure for entry, use of observer seat and oxygen masks, avoidance of distractions etc.); (d) training needs are addressed and identified as appropriate; (e) safety risks stemming from the authorised person leaving the passenger cabin are assessed and mitigated, if necessary; and (f) resulting procedures are detailed in the Operations Manual and, when relevant, the related security reference documents.

E412,1,Wave of Misconstrued Migration,"FACT CHECK: Does a photograph depict a tramp steamer carrying Muslim refugees from Libya to Italy?  Claim: A photograph depicts a tramp steamer carrying Muslim refugees from Libya to Italy.  FALSE  Example: [Collected via e-mail and Imgur, September 2015]  What the mainstream, leftist media do not show us. A tramp steamer leaving for Italy from Libya. And everyone on board gets accepted by the kind, loving, Politically Correct Europeans — who will soon find themselves overrun by people who mostly cannot speak the languages of host nations and have limited skills in areas needed by technologically advanced countries and thus can hardly contribute to the economies of their benefactors. Worse, a floodtide of the Muslim way of life is hereby being imported — by people who refuse to integrate into new societies they infiltrate but instead soon start demanding that their way of life, their beliefs and their laws prevail. The next step is a Muslim Europe.  Origins: Global news coverage of the 2 September 2015 death of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi prompted worldwide concern over the then-current Syrian refugee crisis, and in the wake of that event the message and images excerpted above began circulating.  While refugees who arrived in Europe shortly after Kurdi’s death were openly welcomed by waiting crowds, expressions of sympathy for the plight of those making the trip caused some discomfort and debate in Europe. It’s likely the above-quoted e-mail resulted from that dissonance, serving as a warning for those who might think the temporary relaxation of border policies was without its drawbacks.  However, the photographs employed to convey that warning were incorrectly described. It was immediately apparent that they were not from mid-2015, as evidenced by their appearence in a 2014 Imgur post as well as a 12 August 2012 news article. Before they were appropriated in 2015 to accompany a warning about Syrian refugees, the photographs were published as documenting an influx of people migrating from Albania to Italy in 1991:  With crowds numbering in the thousands in Vlora and Durres, harbor security forces apparently gave up trying to exercise control, allowing people to swarm aboard vessels and commandeer them for transport to Italy. Earlier today the vessel Ibridim radioed in midpassage, saying it was crammed with refugees and required assistance. Later, the freighters Tirana and Lirija approached Brindisi purportedly carrying a total of 6,000 Albanians, only to be told by Italian harbor officials to lie offshore until reception centers could be prepared.  A 2011 post on the blog Migrants at Sea explained the events depicted in the images:  20th Anniversary of the Arrival at Bari, Italy of 15,000 Albanian Boat People Twenty years ago, on 8 August 1991, several ships carrying approximately 15,000 Albanian migrants succeeded in entering the port of Bari, Italy. The Italian government’s response was harsh. Most of the Albanians were detained in a sports stadium without adequate food, water, or access to bathrooms. Italian authorities dropped supplies to the detained migrants by helicopter. Within several weeks most of the migrants were deported to Albania. Their harsh treatment was criticised by human rights organisations and the Pope, but was justified by the Italian government as necessary to deter further irregular migration from Albania.  The Vlora incident involved refugees from Albania (not Libya) traveling to Italy, it was prompted by an economic crisis triggered by the collapse of communism (not civil war or religious strife), it did not encompass solely Muslims (Albania is only about 58% Muslim), and it occurred nearly a quarter of a century ago (not within the last year). And the means by which Syrian refugeees have been making their way to Europe, typically crammed into dangerously overloaded small boats, looks far more like this than the images referenced above:  As for the claim that such emigrants “have limited skills in areas needed by technologically advanced countries and thus can hardly contribute to the economies of their benefactors,” the Albanian diaspora that began in the early 1990s saw about 45% of that nation’s academics leaving the country to take up residence elsewhere, many of whom have since returned to Albania.

politifact13561,1,BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT,"BREAKING!  Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.  They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!  Scary!  From HuffPo:  A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.  In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.  At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.  The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.  The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.  Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives."
pheme_255,1,"Sydney café siege victims identified as Tori Johnson, Katrina Dawson","The two hostages killed during a 16-hour siege at a Sydney café have been identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, a lawyer and mother of three, and Tori Johnson, 34, the manager of the establishment. The Iranian-born gunman who took them and 15 others hostage also died when police stormed the Lindt Chocolat Café in the heart of Sydney's financial district early Tuesday.  Katrina Dawson, 38, was a lawyer and mother of three. She was one of two hostages killed in Monday's siege. (Family handout/AAP/EPA)  Lindt Australia released a statement on its Facebook page saying Johnson had worked for the company for two years.  ""He was a great ambassador for our company and the store that he managed, which he cared about passionately,"" the statement from Lindt Australia CEO Stephen Loane said. ""He was a dedicated professional who always built a great rapport with his customers and was much loved by the Lindt team.  The hostage-taker has been identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born man who was out on bail on charges of sexual assault and being an accessory to murder of his ex-wife. (Sergio Dionisio/EPA) ""By nature, he was a perfectionist, and he had a genuine passion for the hospitality industry and people. He was a really important part of our management team in Australia, and his loss is absolutely tragic.""  Dawson was also remembered as a bright professional well-liked and respected by her colleagues.  ""Katrina was one of our best and brightest barristers who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends,"" Jane Needham, president of the New South Wales Bar Association, said in a statement. ""She was a devoted mother of three children and a valued member of her floor and of our bar community.""  Police give details of wounded  Four people were wounded in the siege, and two pregnant women were hospitalized as a precaution. On Tuesday, police gave an update on their status:  A 75-year-old female: gunshot wound to the shoulder — stable condition.  A 52-year-old female: gunshot wound to the foot — stable.  A 43-year-old female: gunshot wound to the leg — stable.  A 39-year-old male: minor facial injury due to gunshot – treated at hospital and discharged.  A 35-year-old pregnant female: assessed for health and welfare purposes — stable.  A 30-year-old pregnant female: assessed for health and welfare purposes — stable.  Police stormed the café in the heart of Sydney's financial district shortly after 2 a.m. local time after they heard a number of gunshots from inside, ending a siege that lasted almost 16 hours.  ""They made the call because they believed that at that time, if they didn't enter, there would have been many more lives lost,"" said New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione.  ""Until we were involved in this emergency action, we believed that no one had been injured. That changed. We changed our tactic.""  Scipione wouldn't say whether the two hostages who were killed were caught in crossfire or shot by the gunman.  Harper calls siege 'barbaric act of depravity'  [The gunman] had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. - Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott  Local media identified the hostage-taker as 50-year-old Man Haron Monis, and a police official confirmed his identity. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman ""was well known to state and Commonwealth authorities"" and had been prosecuted for sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.  ""He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" Abbott said at a news conference in Canberra Tuesday morning local time.  Abbott said Monis also posted ""graphic, extremist material"" online.  Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks at a press conference in Parliament House in Canberra early Tuesday. (Xu Haijing/Xinhua/Associated Press) ""As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL-death cult,"" Abbott said referring to the extremist group ISIS, also known as ISIL or Islamic State. ""Tragically, there are people in our community ready to engage in politically motivated violence.""  Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, issued a statement expressing condolences to the friends and families of those who died and a ""speedy recovery"" to those injured.  ""While Canada mourns with the people of Australia, we are also outraged by this barbaric act of depravity on innocent civilians who were merely going about their daily routine,"" the statement said. ""Canada and our allies will stand firm and will stand together against those who would threaten peace, freedom and democracy and all of the values we so cherish.""  No bombs found  The standoff, which began around 9:45 a.m. local time Monday, ended when a loud bang was heard from the café and five people ran out. Shortly after, police swooped in, amid heavy gunfire, shouts and flashes. A police bomb disposal robot also was sent into the building, but no explosives were found.  There were originally 17 people inside the café when the siege began.  Police said an investigation is underway because police were involved in an incident in which people died.  Monis came to Australia as a political refugee from Iran and was granted asylum. He has long been on officials' radar. Last year, he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service for using the postal service to send what a judge called ""grossly offensive"" letters to families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009.  At the time, Monis said his letters were ""flowers of advice,"" adding: ""Always, I stand behind my beliefs.""  He was later charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. Earlier this year, he was charged with the sexual assault of a woman in 2002. He has been out on bail on the charges.  One-off act, says lawyer  ""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""It's a damaged-goods individual who's done something outrageous.  ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.""  The siege began around 9:45 a.m. local time in Martin Place, a plaza in Sydney's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Many of those inside the café would have been taken captive as they stopped in for their morning coffees.  Flag in window displayed Shahada  Hundreds of police blanketed the city as streets were closed and offices evacuated. The public was told to stay away from Martin Place, site of the state premier's office, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the headquarters of two of the nation's largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away, and the landmark Sydney Opera House also is nearby.  Throughout the day, several people were seen with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the window of the café, with two people holding up a black flag with the Shahada, or Islamic declaration of faith, written on it.  The Shahada translates as ""There is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger."" It is considered the first of Islam's five pillars of faith and is similar to the Lord's Prayer in Christianity. It is pervasive throughout Islamic culture, including the green flag of Saudi Arabia. Jihadis have used the Shahada in their own black flag.  Channel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage in the café had relayed the gunman's demands. The station said police requested they not broadcast it, and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police.  A number of Australian Muslim groups condemned the hostage-taking in a joint statement and said the flag's inscription was a ""testimony of faith that has been misappropriated by misguided individuals.""  Australians show solidarity with Muslims  In a show of solidarity on Twitter, many Australians offered to accompany people dressed in Muslim clothes who were afraid of a backlash after the café siege. The hashtag #IllRideWithYou had been used more than 90,000 times by late Monday evening local time.  Seven Network television news staff watched the gunman and hostages for hours from a fourth-floor window of their Sydney offices, opposite the café.  The gunman could be seen pacing back and forth past the café's windows. Reporter Chris Reason said the man carried what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun, was unshaven and wore a white shirt and a black cap.  Some of the hostages were forced up against the windows.  ""The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,"" Reason said in a report from the vantage point. ""One woman we've counted was there for at least two hours — an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.""  ""When we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,"" he added.  Reason later reported that staff brought food from a kitchen at the rear of the café and the hostages were fed.  Lindt sends sympathies on Facebook  As night set in, the lights inside the café were switched off. Armed police guarding the area outside fitted their helmets with green-glowing night goggles.  ""This is a very disturbing incident,"" Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. ""It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.""  Lindt Australia thanked the public for its support.  ""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident, and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company wrote in a Facebook post.  There haven't been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country. - Charles Knight, lecturer, Macquarie University  Australia's government raised the country's terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the militant group ISIS, also known as Islamic State. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities — Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an ISIS leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.  ISIS, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, the group's spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, issued an audio message urging so-called lone-wolf attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all ""disbelievers,"" whether they be civilians or soldiers.  One terrorism expert said the situation appeared to be that of a ""lone wolf"" making his own demands, rather than an attack orchestrated by a foreign jihadist group.  ""There haven't been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country — that is quite positive,"" said Charles Knight, lecturer in the Department of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Australia's Macquarie University.  ""The individual or individuals involved didn't kill early, which is part of the pattern of some recent international attacks. ... It seems to be shifting more into the model of a traditional hostage situation, rather than the sort of brutal attacks we've seen overseas."""
pheme_392,1,FAA recognizes Andreas Guenter Lubitz,"FAA recognizes Andreas Guenter Lubitz  Rheinland Pfalz-based pilot sets positive example  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is recognizing Andreas Guenter Lubitz with inclusion in the prestigious FAA Airmen Certification Database.  The database, which appears on the agency's website at www.faa.gov, names Lubitz and other certified pilots who have met or exceeded the high educational, licensing and medical standards established by the FAA.  Pilot certification standards have evolved over time in an attempt to reduce pilot errors that lead to fatal crashes. FAA standards, which are set in consultation with the aviation industry and the public, are among the highest in the world.  Transportation safety experts strongly recommend against flying with an uncertified pilot. FAA pilot certification can be the difference between a safe flight and one that ends in tragedy.  The FAA recently announced that is it increasing the qualification requirements for co-pilots who fly for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines. These requirements mandate additional minimum flight time and training, as well as aircraft specific training.  ""Safety will be my overriding priority as Secretary, so I am especially pleased to mark my first week by announcing a rule that will help us maintain our unparalleled safety record,"" said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in a press release. ""We owe it to the traveling public to have only the most qualified and best trained pilots.""  According to the FAA, the new regulations stem in part from the crash of Colgan Air 3407 in February 2009. An investigation of the crash revealed that pilot Renslow, had failed three ""check rides"" (the flying equivalent of driver proficiency tests) and may not have had adequate training to respond to the emergency leading up to the crash.  The FAA offers a variety of pilots licenses and certificates, each with a different set of privileges. These levels include Student, Recreational, Sport, Private, Commercial And Airline Transport Pilot.  Pilots with a student pilot certification are not permitted to fly solo and are barred from carrying passengers. Sport pilot certificate holders can not carry more than one passenger and are permitted to only fly light-sport aircraft during the daytime.  The highest level of certification is the Airline Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP), which is required to fly a commercial airliner.  To obtain Airline Transport Pilot Certificate, pilots must possess a commercial pilot license, have more than 1500 hours of experience in aircraft and be at least 21 years old. However, pilots with an aviation degree can qualify for the certificate with just 1,000 hours.  Pilots obtaining an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate must also pass an exam covering air law, general aircraft knowledge, flight planning, meteorology, navigation, instrumentation and other important topics.  Pilots are required to pass a physical examination administered by a FAA-authorized medical examiner.  There are a number of medical conditions that the FAA considers disqualifying, such as Bipolar disease, cardiac valve replacement, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus requiring hypoglycemic medications, disturbance of consciousness without satisfactory explanation of cause, epilepsy, heart replacement, Myocardial infarction, permanent cardiac pacemaker, personality disorder that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts, psychosis, substance abuse, substance dependence, transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory explanation of cause.  Pilots are required to report to the FAA's Security and Investigations Division any alcohol-related vehicle actions, such as an arrest, administrative action, driver license suspension.  The FAA has reason to be concerned in general about alcohol use by pilots. Recently, a 48 year-old American Eagle pilot was forced from the aircraft cockpit after airline employees smells alcohol on him. The pilot, Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen , subsequently failed a breathalyzer test and was arrested.

E255,1,BREAKING: Jake From State Farm Found Dead In Apartment Bedroom,"BREAKING: Jake From State Farm Found Dead In Apartment Bedroom  NEW YORK – It is being reported that ‘Jake From State Farm’ was reportedly found dead in his apartment bedroom Saturday night. According to authorities, Jake was killed by his wife after finding him in bed with another woman.  Jake From State Farm first appeared in a television advertisement for State Farm a few years ago, and has since been the center of many internet jokes and memes. The basic name structure of Jake From State Farm has been copied for other internet memes including ‘Alex From Target’ and ‘Daquan From Staples’.  Jake From State Farm was murdered by his own wife for allegedly cheating on her. Very Ironic, considering that the original Jake From State Farm commercial was about being unfaithful. According to State Farm, Jake would be a good neighbor to all of his clients, but when he needed help, nobody was there for him. Jake’s wife was arrested a few hours following the murder. “A true hero” quoted State Farm.  Jake’s funeral will be held next week.

E286,1,Eurospa Eucalyptus Oil Uses: CDC Says the Flu Shot is Less Effective,"Scientists are concerned about what they're seeing so far this flu season, the director of  the Centers for Disease Control said Thursday, due to the cells mutating. Citizens everywhere are dependent on what's now, no longer helpful, and are in need of some alternative options. We at Eurospa, understand the need for medicine that works, which is why we look to nature to healing. Medicine and nature both have their place. When the flu hits, it's good to be educated. So, since the CDC says the flu shot is less effect, so try these natural remedies instead!      Start with steam  We've said it before, because it's what we're built on. Steam is one of the best things you can do for this cold and flu. Our bronchial passages open up and relax their tension upon meeting the steam. As well, when you spray Eucalyptus oil into the steam the effects are even greater. Eucalyptus oil not only stimulates the immune system, but also relieves pain and acts as an anti-bacterial agent. Simply spray into shower steam or into a stove top pot for faster inhalation. Do this twice per day.      Homemade tonic  Making your own tonic is a strong way to support your immune system whether keeping the germs away or to get better faster. Combine in one glass:  -1 TBSP raw honey  -1 TBSP raw apple cider vinegar  -1 crushed garlic clove  -1 drop of therapeutic grade oregano oil * (it's important to only use therapeutic grade oils when ingesting.) Also keep in mind that oregano, a powerful antiviral and antibiotic, is a HOT oil, meaning that it can burn if left too strong on the skin. Be sure to only put one drop per glass. IF the oil get's on your lips, simply rub on olive or coconut oil rather than water as water will only intensify the heat.      Both remedies have significantly treated the many different symptoms that are common with this years cold and flu viruses. At Eurospa , we value your health and want to know that life is being enjoyed for you at it's best.    "

E636,1,Pastor John Piper: “Women Who Wax Their Private Parts Are Hurting God’s Work”,"“Pastor John Piper, founder of the website desiringGod.com and author of more than 50 books, agrees that cosmetic surgery is a sin because as he once put it during an online sermon, “God doesn’t make mistakes.”  ““God knit us together in our mother’s womb, he really made our basic structures and there’s some of you [who] are just not going to change – the kinds of hair you’ve got, the kind of nose you’ve got, the kind of hips you’ve got, the kind of height you’ve got and kind of complexion you’ve got. These are things that are just given with our God-given genetics and therefore it really is a matter of trust, isn’t it?” he asked. “God doesn’t make mistakes, so let’s all present our bodies with all the pluses and minuses as a living sacrifice acceptable to God.”  However, “the chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary went even further, saying that women who “groom their private parts are no less sinful than those undergoing plastic surgery procedures.”  “What most women don’t understand is the complexity of God’s work when he created man. He made us the way we are for a reason. Like I said, some people are hairy, others aren’t, there are millions of different members of our species on the planet,” Piper stated. “But, grooming private parts, and especially waxing the hair from there completely is equally wrong as getting your nose thinned or augmenting your breasts. It just wasn’t meant to be done.”  The pastor also added: “If God felt it was wise, he would have made women without hairy private parts. But, obviously, that wasn’t the case. We need to stop trying to fix things that aren’t broken. What surprises me even more is that this is one of the few issues on which evolutionary theories and religion concur. God’s work is just God’s work.”"
politifact14884,1,Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart,"0  DECATUR, Alabama –  Police were recently tipped off to a reported meth lab that was being run by Walmart employees in what they are calling one of the biggest busts in decades.  Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.  “The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.”  No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.  0  Comments  comments"
E454,1,Woman stabs boyfriend for not liking Instagram selfie fast enough,"Woman stabs boyfriend for not liking Instagram selfie fast enough  DAVE WEASEL  CANTON, OH – A 22 year old woman was arrested after stabbing her boyfriend in the face with a sharpened selfie-stick because he did not like her post on Instagram within the allotted 10 minute timeframe.  “This is atrocious, I can’t believe I am being charged for exercising what should be a constitutional right,” says the suspect. “This is 2015. When are the fat cats in Washington going to wake up and realize that when you are in a relationship, you must like your partner’s picture as soon as they post it. If anyone is the victim here, it is me.”  Her lawyer also made a statement. “This young woman acted in self defence, he assaulted her feelings. She spent over 3 hours picking and adjusting the perfect filter for her selfie. She even logged into Facebook Messenger and saw he was ‘online now’ and had yet to acknowledge and validate her appearance, as though he thinks she is ugly. For the man to wait an entire 11 minutes is a senseless, barbaric act of violence towards her self-esteem.”  “This woman is a political prisoner, persecuted because of her race” adds the DA, who plans to drop all charges. “I too suffer from WGP [white girl problems] and am sick of people trying to hold me accountable for my unreasonable, borderline psychotic reactions to tedious things. Her boyfriend could’ve been doing anything during those 11 minutes, like sleeping with other women. I can’t even imagine the level of anxiety she must’ve felt while sharpening that selfie-stick, waiting for him to return home. The man survived the attack but we will be filing assault charges against him and pursuing the death penalty.”"
E496,1,Trump: “Build a Fence Around New Mexico”,"HOT SPRINGS, AR– Saying, “New Mexico. Mexico. It’s all the same. The word Mexico is in the name of both places, isn’t it?,” Republican presidential contender Donald Trump doubled down on his controversial comments about Mexico during a campaign speech here, telling supporters that he would, “Build a fence around New Mexico and make them pay for it” if he becomes president.  “First thing I’d do – and mark my words on this one – I’d call (New Mexico Governor) Susana Martinez and say to her, ‘Listen, sweetie, cut the crap and quit sending the worst of your worst to all the other states, the rapists and murderers and drug dealers and all the other low-lifes you have there in Santa Fe.’ I mean, come on, the meth problem is so bad there they made a documentary about that Walter White character, cooking up drugs in an RV out in the desert,” he continued, adding, “And now there’s a new show out there glorifying his scumbag attorney. Well, the buck stops with me. Look it up. I’m very rich and I’m also a nice guy.”          A Trump spokesperson, David Atherton, confirmed the candidate was referring to the long-running AMC series Breaking Bad and its prequel, Better Call Saul. When asked if Trump knew they are both fictional television shows that happen to be set in New Mexico, Gonzalez deflected the answer. “Donald Trump can’t be a racist. After all, he hired me to as a spokesperson and I have friends in New Mexico. The liberal media would like nothing better than to elect a known drug kingpin like Walter White himself to be president.”  During his speech, Trump touched on the weekend escape of real-life drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman from a high-security prison in Mexico. Earlier in the day, Guyzman reportedly sent threatening Tweets to Trump. “If I were (President) Obama, I’d send the FBI to stake out Walter White’s place. Dollars to donuts, I’d bet a lot of money – and I have a lot of money, look it up, I’m very, very rich – that’s where ‘Chapo’ is, right this second. After all, birds of a feather, right? I mean, they’re both drug dealers. For all we know, Albuquerque is a sanctuary city, which means ‘president pothead’ – the guy smoked a lot of dope in college, look it up if you don’t believe me – he won’t lay a glove on the place. What a dope and a loser, that’s my final word on that,” Trump said.        [adsforwp id=""70836""]"
E165,1,Syrian refugees beginning to arrive in New Orleans,"NEW ORLEANS, LA (WVUE) - The flood of refugees migrating from the terror in Syria and Afghanistan has begun to have a trickle effect in the New Orleans area.  ""We had served two families, we're expecting one more soon, and we do not know how many more, but we expect more,"" said Martin Gutierrez of Catholic Charities, which is part of the Archidiocese of New Orleans.  Catholic Charities has targeted services for helping refugees.  ""So it's a matter of uniting the families, which is something that the church really promotes, obviously. Some of them don't have relatives and we try to help them become integral parts of our communities,"" Gutierrez said.  But some have argued against the U.S. accepting Syrian refugees, fearing terrorists might slip through the cracks. We turned to former New Orleans FBI chief and anti-terrorism expert Jim Bernazzani for insight on whether that's a legitimate concern. Before coming to New Orleans, Bernazzani worked to ramp up the nation's anti-terror strategies after 911.  ""If I was in charge of ISIL, logistically I'd take advantage of this situation and put my people in, into the United States,"" Bernazzani said. ""Now with that said, the FBI is on top of this big time with our Joint Terrorism Task Force and we have what's called a Terrorist Screening Center that these individuals will be run through.""  But make no mistake, not every refugee seeking admission to the U.S. would face such scrutiny.  ""It's going to be the 18- to 45-year-old male for the most part,"" he said. ""It's a percentage game. It's not fail-safe, but it's a percentage game.""  Still, as more of the refugees take up residency in the New Orleans area, Bernazzani discourages fear.  ""These are just people from another country trying to escape misery by virtue of a civil war,"" he said. ""We had our own civil war, and so I wouldn't be worried, but I would be vigilant,"" he said.  As local humanitarian agencies continue to serve refugees from Syria who find their way here, ""there are multiple background checks that are done on these families and it is part of our Christian faith to welcome the stranger,"" said Gutierrez.

politifact14777,1,412 Michigan Muslims Arrested In Fed’s ‘LARGEST BUST IN U.S. HISTORY’,"The state of Michigan is quickly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the past 8 years. Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”    The corrupt establishment will do anything to suppress sites like the Burning Platform from revealing the truth.

[Burning Platform LLC - PO Box 1520 Kulpsville, PA 19443] or Paypal  Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.  The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:  “Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.  Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.  One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.  Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.  ‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.  A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”  The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.  Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.  More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include:  Mashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County – controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness;  Yasser Mozeb, of Oakland County – allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness;  Abdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians;  Joseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical;  Tariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.  Mohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.  Trump’s Justice Department isn’t messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid’s companies’ fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.  We must continue to sound the alarm about what’s going right underneath our noses. This isn’t the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!"

E51,1,San Bernardino terroroist Tashfeen Malik who pledged allegiance to ISIS pictured,"ISIS has claimed responsibility for the California attack on a social services agency that left 14 people dead.  The terror group announced in an online radio broadcast that two ISIS followers had carried out the attack in San Bernadino on Wednesday.  ‘Two followers of Islamic State attacked several days ago a center in San Bernadino in California,’ the group’s daily broadcast al-Bayan said.  Scroll down for video  Tashfeen Malik, 27, wore a burka and didn't speak to male relatives, Syed Farook's family members said, adding that they had never seen her face, according to the family's attorneys. ABC News released the first photograph of Malik, pictured above. ISIS announced she and her husband were followers of the terror group  Malik killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, alongside her husband, 28-year-old Syed Farook (pictured) on Wednesday  U.S. government sources have said that there is no evidence the attack was directed by the militant group, or that the organization even knew who the attackers were.  The FBI is referring to the attack as an 'act of terrorism'.  The first photograph of the Muslim mother-turned-killer, Tashfeen Malik, 27, who carried out the savage attack emerged on Friday.  Attorneys representing the couple's family, Mohammad Abuershaid and Daniel Chesley, shed further insight into Malik's life saying that she wore a burka, didn't speak to male relatives and her in-laws had never seen her face.  At a press conference on Friday the attorneys also revealed that the Muslim couple met through a marriage and dating website some time in 2013 and wed in California the following year.  Abuershaid said that family members saw Malik as a 'very private', soft-spoken and caring housewife. He added that Malik spoke broken English.  Media and neighbors enter the boarded-up apartment of Farook and Malik, who died in a shootout with police hours after the massacre in San Bernardino on Wednesday  Hours after journalists entered the couple's home, attorneys for Farook's family revealed information about Malik, saying many of the men in the family had never spoken to her  The couple's home was swarming with members of the media following Wednesday's shooting, which killed 14 people  'They were very traditional. When family would come over, the women would sit with the women and the men would sit with the men, so the men had never spoken to her,' Abuershaid said. '[Malik] wore a burka, so she was never seen by the men.'  He said that very little is known about Malik and her family, who are believed to be in Saudi Arabia.  'She was a very, very private person. She kept herself isolated and she was very conservative,' Chelsey added. 'Because everyone knows so little, she's easy to pin things to.'  Malik studied to be a pharmacist in Pakistan, but did not work in the field in the United States, where she instead lived as a housewife with she and Farook's six-month-old baby.  She also chose not to drive voluntarily, Abuershaid said.  The attorney added that Farook's mother lived in the upstairs area of the couple's home and did not have knowledge of the planned attack on Wednesday.  Attorneys David Chesley, left, and Mohammad Abuershaid, right, who are representing Farook's family, said there's no proof linking the shooters to a broader terrorist organization. They are pictured speaking at a press conference on Friday where they shed more light on the couple  The FBI announced Friday that it is investigating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism but said they did not believe the Muslim couple were part of a larger plot or members of a terror cell.  If the investigation confirms those initial suspicions, the attack would be the deadliest inspired by Islamic extremism on U.S. soil since September 11.  While authorities did not cite specific evidence that led them to the terrorism focus, a U.S. law enforcement official said that Malik, had under a Facebook alias pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader al-Baghdadi.  A Facebook official said Malik praised Islamic State in a post at 11am Wednesday, around the time the couple stormed the Inland Regional Center where staff were enjoying a holiday party and opened fire. The profile was quickly removed from public view and its contents reported to law enforcement.  David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said on Friday that the shooters attempted to destroy evidence, including crushing two cell phones and discarding them in a trash can.  The FBI chief also had established that there were 'telephonic connections' between the couple and other people of interest in FBI probes.  An acquaintance of Farook, Nizaam Ali, said he knew nothing about Farook's wife and knew little about the couple's child  Meanwhile friends have revealed that they knew Farook by his quick smile, his devotion to Islam and his talk about restoring cars.  THE VICTIMS On Thursday, San Bernardino County sheriff's department released the full list of the 14 people who died. They are: Bennetta Bet-Badal, 46, Rialto Aurora Godoy, 26, San Jacinto Isaac Amanios, 60, Fontana Larry Kaufman, 42, Rialto Harry Bowman, 46, Upland Yvette Velasco, 27, Fontana Sierra Clayborn, 27, Moreno Valley Robert Adams, 40, Yucaipa Nicholas Thalasinos, 52, Colton Tin Nguyen, 31, Santa Ana Juan Espinoza, 50, Highland Damian Meins, 58, Riverside Shannon Johnson, 45, Los Angeles Michael Wetzel, 37, Lake Arrowhead  They say they didn't know he was busy with his wife building pipe bombs and stockpiling thousands of rounds of ammunition for the assault on Farook's colleagues from San Bernardino County's health department.  Speaking at the Dar Al Uloom Al Islamiyah-Amer mosque, where Farook worshipped, assistant teacher Roshan Abassi said that Malik 'dressed modestly and didn't show her face'.  'He [Farook] hasn't come to our mosque for a while, it's been around a month,' Abassi said 'Even if she [Malik] would come, I couldn't see her because she was modestly dressed, she didn't show her face.'  He said he had spent some time speaking with Farook but claimed conversation was limited to pleasantries.  'He would say hello, how are you, what's up, what are your future goals,' he explained.  Fellow worshipper Nasser Shehata said he spoke to Farook regularly and described him as 'very quiet and shy'.  'He worked in the area but he lived in Riverside,' he said. 'He was a very quiet person, on the shy side. He prayed and he would leave.  'Two years [ago] he went to Saudi Arabia and married his wife but he didn't get radicalized there.  'Six months ago, he was very happy when his daughter was born and he looked forward to having a life with his daughter. Something changed in the last six months.'  A university ID shows Syed Rizwan Farook with a fuller beard than in his driving license photo. There are claims that his wife radicalized him after he married her in Saudi Arabia and brought her to the US  Nizaaam Ali, an acquaintance of Farook, told CNN that Farook never spoke of Malik and rarely spoke of their child - not even announcing the baby's birth.  Ali said Farook would come for the noon prayer each day during his lunch break from work.  'He was such a sweet young man,' Ali told CNN. 'Everyone who knew him always talked so highly of him. Until today. To try and understand this, it's really difficult for us.'  Ali was one of the 300 people that attended the wedding of Farook and Malik in August 2014 at the mosque.  However he said Farook 'never' brought his wife him to pray, because he would come from work, and when Ali did see Malik, she was always completely covered by a niqab.  'I wouldn't have been able to tell the color of her eyes even,' Ali told CNN. 'Was she skinny, was she fit? I don't know. I never saw her. (Farook) never described her. He never said anything about her.'  At this stage in the investigation, officials say it appears the couple were inspired by ISIS, rather than expressly ordered to carry out the attacks.  Some investigators believe Malik and Farook were self-radicalized, but it is also possible that someone may have motivated them.  Malik moved to Saudi Arabia from Pakistan about 25 years ago but returned home to study to become a pharmacist, according to two Pakistani officials. She had two brothers and two sisters and was related to Ahmed Ali Aulak, a former provincial minister.  Malik was from the Layyah district in southern Punjab province, the officials said. She returned to Pakistan five or six years ago to complete a degree from Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan.  An online transcript from Bahauddin Zakariya University uncovered by Daily Mail Online on Friday shows Malik scored 74.88 out of 100 on one of her pharmacy exams.  Bloody aftermath: The lifeless body of gunman Syed Farook, with his hands cuffed behind his back, is seen lying face down on the ground next to a large pool of blood in the wake of Wednesday evening's gun battle with police  One of Malik's uncles, Javed Rabbani, said Malik's father, Gulzar, changed while the family was living in Saudi Arabia.  'When relatives visited him, they would come back and tell us how conservative and hard-line he had become,' Rabbani said in an interview with Reuters.  The father had built a house in Multan, where he stays when he visits Pakistan, according to another uncle, Malik Anwaar.  He said Gulzar had a falling-out long ago with the rest of the family, citing a dispute over a house among other matters. 'We are completely estranged,' Anwaar said.  Rabbani said he had been contacted by Pakistani intelligence as part of the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting.  Friday's press conference came just hours after Malik and Farook's home was thrown open to the media.  The home revealed scores of family trinkets and toys that would have sat among boxes of ammunition and pipe bombs as they planned their attack.  Young professional: This is a photo of Syed Farook's business card identifying him as an environmental health specialist for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health  Devout: A sticker referencing 'Allah' is displayed on a dresser inside the home of the husband-and-wife shooters, whose actions Wednesday may have been inspired by ISIS  A hole in the ceiling is visible in the couple's bedroom closet. The media tour of the apartment was preceded by an hours-long FBI search  Happier times: A photo from an album found on the premises of the Redlands residence shows what appears to be a birthday celebration attended by young women and girls, most of them wearing Western dress  Family time: Among the heap of images discovered in Farook's home was a family portrait (left) showing a husband, wife and three young children in formal wear, as well as a photo of two unnamed men, an older and a younger one, that may have been taken at a wedding  Photo-op: An image found in the apartment of the suspected terrorist couple shows a group of women and children posing happily for the camera. None of the people depicted here have been identified  The couple's home is filled with family photographs, Korans and other books on Islam but appears to have the appearance of a normal suburban family residence.  Their landlord invited members of the media to tour their rental home in Redlands, California.  ISIS connection: It was revealed Friday that Malik the wife and accomplice of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook (pictured), pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS on Facebook during or right before Wednesday' deadly attacks  Among the photos found in the two-story town house are a series of young women and a California State University identity card belonging to Farook.  Family members knew that Farook owned guns, but believed he kept them locked up, Abuershaid said, adding that the Farook's family is in complete shock.  Journalists were let into the home after FBI investigators had collected all the evidence they needed and turned the apartment back over to its owner.  Federal agents have been combing through cellphones and a computer hard drive left behind by the couple in their Redlands, California, rental home to try to establish a motive for the killings.  When asked to explain possible motivations for the attack, Chesley said at the news conference on Friday that co-workers made fun of Farook for his beard and said he was isolated with few friends.  Abuershaid and Chesley said the family was shocked by the attack and saw no signs that the couple would be aggressive or had extreme views.  The attorneys said they sat through four hours of questioning with Farook's family members by the FBI and said nothing was found that showed the family knew of the attacks.  There was nothing linking this to religion or terrorist activity,' Chesley said. 'They're the FBI and they're damn good at receiving this information.'  Chesley claimed that the FBI kept Farook's mother in custody until the rest of her children came in for questioning.  He also said on Friday that it was unfair to blame the attacks on radical Muslims when attacks on Planned Parenthood facilities and abortion clinics are not blamed on extremist Christians.  Both Chesley and Abuershaid said they had seen the FBI's evidence and are not convinced the pair were linked to foreign terror groups.

This screengrab from an NBC video taken inside the residence shows books with Arabic writing on the front  Malik reportedly left a post on an account under a different name aligning herself with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)  FBI agents have been combing through cellphones and a computer hard drive left behind by the couple in their Redlands, California, rental home  Average student: This online transcript from Bahauddin Zakariya University in Pakistan shows Malik scored 74.88 out of 100 on one of her pharmacy exams  Instead they accused investigators, journalists and the public of jumping to assumptions because the couple were Muslim.  In a bizarre remark, Chesley said: 'All there is thus far [to indicate terrorism] is this nebulous thing that somebody looked at something on Facebook.  WHO IS ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI? SHADOWY ISIS LEADER REVEALED Tashfeen Malik, 27, reportedly made a bayat, or pledge of allegiance, to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – the shadowy leader of ISIS who has declared a worldwide caliphate and himself the leader of all Muslims. He has called on all Sunni Muslims to join him – ISIS also wants to eradicate Shia Muslims – and expects a final apocalyptic showdown with the armies of 'Rome' (The West) in Dabiq, a small town of Megiddo near Aleppo in Syria. Currently in ISIS territory, the terror group will defeat Western armies in Dabiq and this battle will, in turn, start the countdown to the end of the world, according to al-Baghdadi's ideology The 44-year-old has been a life-long cleric after attending the Islamic University in Baghdad, and rose to prominence as a senior figure of Al Qaeda in Iraq during the American occupation. After AQI morphed into ISIS, al-Baghdadi took over as leader following the death of his predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.  'I mean any one of us can look at something on Facebook, it doesn't mean we believe in it. I've checked out a Britney Spears post, and I hate Britney Spears' music.'  Chesley said: 'When a Christian goes to shoot up a Planned Parenthood or an extreme Catholic goes and bombs an abortion clinic, all the headlines do not say ""extremist radical Christian, Catholic, Christian, Catholic""... just like right now every headline is saying Muslim.  'There is a tendency to take a cookie cutter version or paradigm of a terrorist type event and superimpose it on a situation just because that person is of Muslim belief or Muslim tradition.  'I do not think we should jump to too many conclusions in particular because I think we need to protect the Muslim community.'  In fact, it is believed that Planned Parenthood shooting suspect Robert Lewis Dear, 57, was an evangelical Christian, rather than a Catholic.  Challenged over the remarks by journalists who pointed out that it was the FBI themselves who announced their investigation is linked to terrorism, Abuershaid hit back.  He said: 'I think every investigation the FBI does when it's involving a Muslim will involve some kind of terrorist investigation.'  The attorneys said the FBI will continue their investigation through Monday and Tuesday.  '[Motive] has been very hidden. I guess we're all wanting justice, and we're all wanting to know anyone affiliated with [the attack]. We need to be protective and respectful of everyone's freedom of religion,' Chesley said, suggesting that this could be a case of a disgruntled worker.  Syed Rizwan Farook (pictured), 28, who is US-born, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, were killed in a gun battle with police after the mass shooting at a government holiday party held at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino  'Normal family: Farhan Khan (L), brother-in-law of San Bernandino shooter Syed Farook, says his relative had a 'normal' family life and was not a religious radical  Family speak out: Saira Khan, Syed Farook's sister, and her husband, told CBS This Morning expressed shock and heartbreak at the carnage caused by their relative and his wife  Chesley noted the number of bullets found in the couple's home, and said that as a gun owner, this was not unusual.  'As Americans, we all want to protect one another and live in a safe and secure society,' he said. 'As a gun owner, I probably have at least 4,000 or 5,000 rounds of bullets in my house.'  In the wake of these latest developments, an ISIS-affiliated news agency Aamaq claimed that Farook and Malik were 'supporters' of the terror group, but it stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack in San Bernardino.  But Comey noted there's still 'a lot evidence that doesn't quite make sense'.  Farook and Malik had illegally modified their two AR-style rifles making it easier to kill a large number of people, officials revealed today.  Meredith Davis, with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that while the weapons were purchased legally, they had undergone a number of illegal adjustments afterwards.  One of the weapons had been modified to allow it to fire on fully-automatic mode, while the other was fitted with a large magazine and had the 'bullet button' removed to allow for quicker reloading.  California law bans the sale of weapons with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, but it is not known how many bullets the weapons used in this week's attack could hold.  The adjustments mean the rifles, a .223 caliber Smith & Wesson M&P 15 and a .223 caliber DPMS A-15, would violate California's ban on assault weapons, Davis told the Wall Street Journal.  The state has some of the toughest gun control laws in America, allowing the sale of handguns and assault-style rifles, but banning the sale of fully-automatic weapons.  All rifles sold in the state must also be fitted with a 'bullet button' - meaning the magazine must be removed by using the tip of a bullet to trip the release mechanism, rather than a quick-release catch.  In total, Farook and Malik were carrying four guns - the two rifles and two semi-automatic handguns - and were in possession of 12 pipe bombs and around 4,500 rounds of ammunition.  Syed Raheel Farook (pictured yesterday left and right in a Facebook photo), the brother of San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook, is a decorated Navy veteran  The stunning disclosure about the pledge of loyalty to the extremist group was preceded by news that investigators were looking into whether Malik was responsible for radicalizing Farook.  According to Fox News, it is believed that on at least one of Farook's two trips to Saudi Arabia in 2013 and 2014, one or both of the spouses reached out to suspected members of al Qaeda.  Christian Nwadike, a co-worker of Farook's at the San Bernardino County health department, told CBS This Morning that the mild-mannered man was different upon his return from Saudi Arabia last year.  When asked if he believed Farook may have been radicalized, Nwadike replied: 'Yes, by the wife. I think he married a terrorist.'  Nwadike said told CNN that he believes Farook was 'set up' to commit the massacre through his marriage to Malik.  Another friend from the mosque, Abdul Aziz Ahmed, also said Farook stopped attending the mosque following his wedding, and said his radical behavior was completely out of character.  'He was looking good, he seemed good (after returning from Saudi Arabia),' Ahmed told CNN. 'But then he disappeared (after the wedding).'  Ahmed, like many who knew Farook, are struggling to understand his actions.  'He came to the mosque every day for two years. How can this happen, a guy who was very good?' Ahmed said. 'You didn't hear him talking about those mad men, these terrorists.'  Farook was born in Chicago on June 14, 1987, to parents born in Pakistan. He was raised in Southern California.  In July 2010, he was hired as a seasonal public employee and served until December of that year, according to a work history supplied by San Bernardino County. In January 2012, he was rehired as a trainee environmental health specialist before being promoted two years later.  As for Malik, she came to the United States in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fiancée visa, authorities said.  To get the visa, immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks - screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat.  The husband and wife unleashed a barrage of bullets on officers, who returned fire – and hit their rental Ford Expedition SUV (pictured) with 380 rounds  The couple were armed with a .223-caliber DPMS Model A15 rifle, a Smith and Wesson M&P15 rifle as well as Llama handgun and a Smith and Wesson handgun (pictured)  The couple had arrived dressed in black tactical-style vests and opened fire, before being killed in a police shootout. Pictured: police released pictures of items recovered from the scene  An officer looks over the evidence near the remains of a SUV involved in the police shootout in San Bernardino, California  An additional 1,400 rifle rounds were found inside the bullet-riddled vehicle the pair used to evade police on Wednesday. Police also recovered more than 2,000 handgun bullets  A black and yellow duffel bag stuffed with home-made pipe bombs was recovered from a California home linked to suspects Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik  Malik never came through Saudi Arabia and instead traveled through Islamabad, arriving on a K-1 visa for fiancées and with a Pakistani passport. The couple had a six-month-old daughter, who they left with Farook's mother at the home they shared with her before heading to the center.  They reportedly told Farook's mother that they were headed to a doctor's appointment.  Farook and Malik were married on August 16, 2014, in nearby Riverside County, according to their marriage license. Both listed their religion as Muslim.  Farook's older sister, Saira Khan said that when she first saw the news broadcast that identified her brother and his wife as the suspected gunman, that she thought they had 'the wrong person'.  She said in a sit-down interview with MSNBC that she went through phases of 'shock' and disbelief' that her 'introvert' brother would do such a thing.  'I had absolutely no idea that they were involved in anything like that, or that they were even capable of doing something like this,' Khan said.

'The brother I grew up with, the shy introvert, kept-to-himself, quiet kid that we knew, grew up and got married,' she said.  As for Farook's wife, however, Khan said she didn't know much about Malik or her past.  'His wife was recently here. She was only here for two years,' Khan told MSNBC. 'We didn't really know her that well.'  She added, however, that she never saw anything that would suggest that they could be radicalized.  Khan said in separate interview with CBS News this morning that it was 'mind-boggling' to her that her brother and his wife would do something like this.  Her husband, Farhan Khan, tearfully said that he was having a hard time forgiving his brother-in-law for the carnage he caused."
E74,1,President Obama Says Pattern of US Mass Shootings Has 'No Parallel' After San Bernardino Shooting,"President Obama says pattern of U.S. mass shootings has no parallel in world   -- President Obama addressed the fatal shooting in San Bernardino, California Wednesday that left at least 14 dead, saying it continues a disturbing pattern of gun violence in America that has ""no parallel.""  ""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in world,"" Obama told CBS’ Norah O’Donnell in an interview.  Obama added that there were ""steps we can take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently,” he said. “We should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these rare as opposed to normal.”  The president was briefed on the shooting earlier in the day by his Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco, and is receiving regular updates as the situation develops.  In his interview, Obama told O’Donnell that the FBI was on the ground offering assistance to local officials.  “Obviously our hearts go out to the victims and the families,"" Obama said. “So my hope is, is that we are able to contain this particular shooting, and we don’t yet know what the motives of the shooters are.”  President Obama has delivered remarks 15 times following mass shootings in America, the most recent one following the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Oct. 1.  On Tuesday this week in Paris, President Obama remarked on the recent shooting at the Planned Parenthood Center in Colorado Springs, saying, “my hope is, is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action.”  Elsewhere in Washington, D.C., House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his condolences to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting at the top of his remarks at the Capitol Christmas Tree lighting ceremony.  “We are all thinking about the current and ongoing tragedy in California today,” Ryan said, before asking for a moment of silence. “Please keep the victims and the families in your prayers right now.""

politifact15141,1,BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything! – NowTrump,"The Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.  This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.  This is huge.  On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.  According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.  Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.  We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”  Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”  The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.  Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.  Scroll down to the comments and tell us what you think."
